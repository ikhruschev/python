    "The county has had dry weather the last several days, which may have contributed to the number of fires, Fire Rescue officials said. Previous Independence Days were preceded by more rain; there's been only a trace amount of rain to fall since June 27. \n",
    "\n",
    "The county's risk for wildfires increased in the last week, according to the Keetch-Byram drought index, a daily measure of ground moisture to determine how susceptible vegetation could be to catching fire. Wednesday's score was 228 in Brevard on a scale of 800, up 20 percent from Tuesday and nearly 100 points in a week. The higher the number for the index, the higher the risk for brush fires. \n",
    "\n",
    "No other fire departments in the county reported any significant fires caused by fireworks.The Florida Forest Service was not called to assist with any Brevard fires Tuesday, spokesman Sean Gallagher said. \n",
    "\n",
    "The state Fire Marshal's Office is investigating a fire that destroyed a Satellite Beach home in the 600 block of Carribean Road Tuesday night. Investigators said fireworks were not involved in that blaze. \n",
