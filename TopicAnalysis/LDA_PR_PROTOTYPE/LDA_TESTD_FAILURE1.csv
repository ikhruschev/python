If finding deals is your New Year's resolution, January is a great time to start.

For those who want to make saving money a priority in 2017, here are our recommendations for what to buy (and skip) this month based on NerdWallet's analysis of historical sales cycles.

Buy: Christmas decorations

The period after Christmas has long been the best time to buy Christmas decorations.

You may scoop up some post-Christmas deals on Dec. 26, but come Jan. 1, there will still be a handful of artificial trees, red ornaments and shiny wrapping paper spilling over in store clearance aisles. Stock up on holiday close-outs if you have space to hang onto extra tinsel until December.

Skip: Smartphones

You can't always time your smartphone purchase. If your trusty iPhone has seen better days, it may be time for something new. But if you're planning an upgrade in the not-so-imminent future, consider waiting a while longer.

Prices on existing phone models tend to go down whenever a new phone is released. For Apple phones, the sweet spot is usually September after the company's annual keynote product announcement. As for Samsung, tech enthusiasts speculate the Galaxy S8 could arrive around April.

Buy: TVs

The end of football season marks the beginning of television deals, as retailers help shoppers prep for viewing parties. The Super Bowl will air on Feb. 5, but we expect retailers will kick off sales at the end of January "" making it an excellent time to score a bargain.

In 2016, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Amazon and more discounted a wide variety of TVs in assorted brands and sizes ahead of the big game. Look for similar savings again in 2017.

Skip: Toys

Toys were hot during the holidays; if you haven't heard of a Hatchimal, you've probably been living under a rock. But with Christmas over, January likely won't see many worthwhile toy deals. The good news is your little ones are probably set for a while after all of their December gifts.

Buy: Fitness gear

January is a solid time to sign up for a gym at a discounted introductory rate, as many chains offer special New Year's rates. But don't spend that money unless you're sure you'll use the membership. All too often, new members lock themselves in for a full year, then stop showing up after a month or two.

Skip: Mattresses

Great deals on mattresses will come in February, when Presidents Day sales bring discounts. Presidents Day is Feb. 20, so hold off for another month if you're in the market for a new mattress. Or if February is too soon for your budget, mattress deals will be back again in May over Memorial Day weekend and in September over Labor Day weekend.

Buy: Bedding

You might not want to buy a whole new mattress, but you can save on the sheets and blankets that go on your existing mattress. January is the month when department stores host 'white sales' to clear out their existing inventory of sheets, towels, blankets and more. Expect savings to be especially deep on clearance items. Last year, we saw several stores offer 60%-70% off bedding basics.

Bonus: Martin Luther King Jr. Day sales

You may not associate Martin Luther King Jr. Day with shopping, but retailers certainly do. The holiday falls on Jan. 16 this year, and you can anticipate deals on clothing and home goods.

Highlights from the holiday's 2016 sales included 10% off select major appliance purchases of $396 or more at Lowe's and an extra 40% off sale items at Anthropologie with a coupon code as part of the Winter Tag Sale.

Bonus: National Spaghetti Day

It's not just sales to keep an eye out for this month. The calendar year is filled with days of observation for just about everything, and one of them "" National Spaghetti Day "" happens on Jan. 4. Use this day as your chance to get dinner on the house.

In 2016, Noodles & Company gave away a coupon for a free small bowl of spaghetti with purchase of any entree.

Sale shopping reminder

As you're searching for deals and end-of-season savings this month, keep in mind that waiting for low prices can be a trade-off, says Ozalp Ozer, a professor of management science at the Jindal School of Management at The University of Texas at Dallas. You'll have to put time into the search. And buying at the time of a better deal may mean that inventory will already be picked over.

But for the budget-conscious, the extra time and risk of regret is worth it.

2428628411,"With the exception of credit-card use and self-fueling stations, the process of buying gasoline has changed little since the days of Henry Ford. So with gas prices rising again, seasoned technology innovators see an opportunity to change how people pay at the pump.

Even those who represent gas stations say the sector is ripe for innovation.

""People will drive out of their way to save money on gas, even if they have to spend extra money on gas to get there,"" said Jeff Lenard, vice president of strategic initiatives at the National Association of Convenience Stores, a trade association for gas stations. ""It's a great feeling among consumers to take control of something they previously didn't have control of.""

One team hoping to reinvent the market is Upside, a new 13-person company operating out of a co-working space in the District's Chinatown. Founders Alex Kinnier and Wayne Lin once worked at Google before heading east to help build Opower, the Arlington-based home energy analytics firm. Opower became a D.C. success story when it sold to Oracle for $532 million earlier this year.

Upside is getting money and advice from some of Silicon Valley's most exclusive corners. It received an undisclosed amount of seed capital from Formation 8, a venture firm founded by former Facebook chief technology officer Gideon Yu. It is also getting counsel and funding from Hal Varian, a widely published academic who is Google's chief economist.

The company's secret sauce: exploiting a quirk in how gas stations compete for customers.

Upside negotiates discounts on the price of gasoline sold at individual stations and posts them on a map accessible from a smartphone app. Users claim their savings by taking a picture of their receipt, much like the mobile check-deposit services many banks now use.

Other apps, such as GasBuddy, have done this sort of thing for years. Where Upside stands out is on the supply side of the retail equation.

Individual gas stations tend to compete for prices on a corner-by-corner, highway-exit-by-highway-exit basis. Prices can be widely variant from one side of town to the other, but stations that cluster near one another in areas of heavy traffic often compete closely on pricing. If a gas station on a crowded block cuts its price by even one cent, the others tend to quickly follow suit, not wanting to lose any incremental customers.

Upside exploits that competition by offering its services to just one station in each cluster (whichever reaches out to Upside first), shutting the others out so that competitors have no idea what the ""true price"" of gas is at that station.

Upside further obscures what the price is by offering a different discount to each user. This reduces the possibility of a price war breaking out; rival stations would have a difficult time figuring out how much they are being undercut.

The D.C. area's fuel market has less competition than, say, an exit on an interstate highway, as stations tend to be less tightly packed. But that has not stopped 650 gas stations in the District, Maryland and Virginia from signing up. Kinnier says Upside is already turning down station owners whose neighbors beat them to the punch.

The company makes money by keeping for itself a small portion of what consumers save when they use the app, an undisclosed cut that represents ""a few percentage points"" of the customer's total savings.

The service is too new to know whether it will be a success. It is only beginning to draw a following. As of Friday, the app had about 5,000 downloads in the Google Play Store and had an average user rating of 4.2 stars out of 5. The company says it has ""tens of thousands"" of users in total.

The company's founders persuaded a contact at Uber's D.C. office to send an email blast to its D.C.-area drivers, as part of an unpaid ""partnership"" that has given the app some devoted users among Uber drivers.

With the help of Hal Varian's economic mind, the company wants to adapt the idea to other markets. The company is laser-focused on the fuel market for now, Kinnier says, but might try to expand to grocery stores later.

The common thread will be using mobile technology to exploit micro-level competition among individual retailers, saving consumers money and taking a cut of the savings.

The company plans to stick to markets for ""necessities""; costs people have to incur on a regular basis to live. That would differentiate Upside from the ""daily deals"" market cornered by Groupon, which has seen consolidation in recent years after initially high hopes.

""It's about helping people do better with the basic necessities in their life,"" Kinnier said.

2429847125,"HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. - The Air Force is well on its way to replacing a critical airborne battle management command and control weapon system with the Dec. 28, 2016 release of the Development request for proposal, or RFP, for the JSTARS Recapitalization program.

The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, or JSTARS, is a key warfighting asset that provides airborne battle management command and control of joint and coalition forces, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information about ground movements to detect and track enemy forces. JSTARS first flew in support of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and has been a high demand airborne command and control asset ever since its initial entry into the U.S. military arsenal.

The release of the RFP follows receipt of an Acquisition Decision Memorandum, or ADM, signed by the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics on Sept. 7, 2016.

""I can't say enough about the outstanding effort by the entire Recap team in reaching this important phase in the program,"" said Col. Dave Learned, JSTARS Recap program manager. ""With the release of the RFP, we are keeping the Recap program on track for successful delivery of a critical warfighting capability.""

The RFP includes all aspects of the system, including the airframe, radar, communication systems and battle management command and control suite. The RFP will result in the delivery of three engineering and manufacturing development, or EMD, JSTARS Recap weapon systems for testing. There are also contract options for low-rate initial production for two more weapon systems and full-rate production of lots #1-3 for four additional weapon systems each, for a total of 17 aircraft.

In addition, options are included for ground support systems, such as training systems, mission planning and processing systems, system integration labs, support equipment and spares.

The Recap program recently completed an 11-month pre-EMD efforts with Northrop Grumman Corp., Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin. According to program officials, these activities helped assess the maturity of subsystem technology, reduced weapon system integration risk and provided information for the RFP.

Ongoing program work includes radar risk reduction efforts with contractors Northrop Grumman Corp. Mission Systems and Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems and pursuing nonrecurring hardware and software engineering activities to ensure radars are scaled to meet JSTARS Recap specific requirements.

""We've completed successful pre-EMD efforts with industry and continue to make progress on our radar risk reduction activities,"" said Learned. ""Thanks to the amazing work by our team, the program is well-positioned for a successful EMD phase. But what's really exciting is how that paves the way for us being able to equip operators with a weapon system that will be more efficient and reliable than the current system. ""

This proposal solicitation will be a full and open competition with an anticipated contract award in fiscal year 2018, to have assets available for initial operational capability by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.

""Through significant effort by the Recap team, and valuable feedback from industry, as well as Air Force and OSD leadership, we now have our final Development RFP out for industry competition,"" said Sueann Lachance, JSTARS Recap Development RFP Program Management lead. ""We're excited to see official proposals.""

VIEW ORIGINAL WASHINGTON (Army News Service) - Supporting the fight around the globe means providing Soldiers with the most advanced technology available.

The right technology can ensure overmatch against future adversaries in an increasingly complex and dangerous world, where the threat is often ""elusive and ambiguous,"" according to Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, speaking at an industry event in Michigan, Oct. 27.

The Army must ride the wave of technology or risk being left behind, cautioned Lt. Gen. Michael E. Williamson, the principal military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology.

Consumer electronics are advancing at an incredibly rapid pace, with the average time to obsolescence of some devices as short as 24 months, he noted at a ""Network Readiness in a Complex World"" panel in July, he said.

Fortunately for Soldiers and the American people, Army researchers and scientists and industry partners made great strides in modernization in 2016. The following is a sampling of 10 of their top advancements and milestones.

30MM CANNON FOR STRYKER

The first prototype Stryker infantry carrier vehicle, outfitted with a 30-millimeter cannon, was delivered to the Army Oct. 27.

The upgraded Stryker vehicle will be known as the Dragoon, the name of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The prototype features a new fully-integrated commander's station, upgraded drivetrain componentry and hull modifications, according to a press release from Program Executive Office-Ground Combat Systems.

According to Allyn, Army leaders in Europe identified a capability gap following the 2015 Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""The Russians, it turns out, had upgraded and fielded significant capabilities while we were engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" he explained.

Army leaders recognized that existing Stryker weaponry placed U.S. forces at unacceptable risk, he said. An urgent operational needs statement submitted in March 2015 resulted in a directed Stryker lethality requirement, one that included an accelerated acquisition effort to integrate the 30-millimeter cannon on the vehicles.

Fielding to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Europe will begin in May 2018, which represents ""a near-record time from concept to delivery,"" Allyn said.

LIGHTWEIGHT BALLISTIC SHIRT

When Army engineer Robert DiLalla set out to develop a new design for Soldier protection, he knew he had to break the mold. The result of his revolutionary approach, which focuses on the Soldier as an athlete, is the game-changing, ballistic combat shirt, a new lightweight body armor system.

""We set out with this science and technology effort to meet the needs of high-performance athletes, which is what Soldiers are,"" said Dilalla, the team leader of the Infantry Combat Equipment Team at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center.

The invention is a departure from the ""interceptor"" body armor system, which was an advancement when it was developed for the Marine Corps in the late 1990s. Over the years, however, the armor system increased in complexity and bulk. As additional components were added, it became difficult for Soldiers to put it on. In contrast, the ballistic combat shirt is easy to don.

""So now instead of having to attach all of these components, you can throw it on like a goalie shirt in hockey,"" DiLalla said. "" It's form-fitting so the Soldiers like it. Instead of one panel, the deltoid section is three panels. It's contoured so it ... has an improved range of motion.""

The shirt weighs 35 percent less than the current interceptor body armor system components it replaces and is less bulky. The invention has been a hit with users.

""The Soldiers have spoken loud and clear with more than 90 percent user acceptance in multiple user evaluations,"" said DiLalla. ""Typically, as we assess new body armor components, we'd consider 60 percent a successful number.""

DOUBLING HOWITZER RANGE

Picatinny Arsenal engineers have been working to create a longer, newly modified M777A2 howitzer that has the potential to double the system's current artillery range.

The modification, called the extended range cannon artillery, or ERCA, adds six feet to the cannon but less than 1,000 pounds to the overall system. A mobility demonstration is the first step to determine if the howitzer can be modified for extended range, or if a new system is required. Mobility testing will be conducted at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, in the near future.

""Right now [the M777] can shoot about 30 kilometers, but once all of the upgrades are complete, it will be able to shoot about 70 kilometers,"" said David Bound, M777ER Lead, Artillery Concepts and Design Branch, which is part of the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, or ARDEC.

""It will be able to reach out and hit targets well in excess before the targets can reach them,"" Bound said. ""It will also give a lot of operational overmatch so the warfighter won't have to worry about coming into a situation where they are under fire before they can return fire.""

NEW HAND GRENADE

Engineers at Picatinny Arsenal are working on the first new lethal hand grenade in more than 40 years. The multi-purpose hand grenade design will provide both fragmentation and blast overpressure more effectively and safely than its legacy counterparts.

Once fielded, Soldiers will be able to select and use a hand grenade with different effects simply by flipping a switch, said Jessica Perciballi, ARDEC project officer for Enhanced Tactical Multi-Purpose, or ET-MP, Army, Grenades & Demolitions Division.

The new grenades are also designed for ambidextrous use, meaning that they can be thrown with either hand. Current grenades require a different arming procedure for left-handed users.

""With these upgrades in the ET-MP, not only is the fuze timing completely electronic, but the detonation train is also out-of-line,"" said Matthew Hall, Grenades Tech Base Development Lead. ""Detonation time can now be narrowed down into milliseconds and, until armed, the hand grenade will not be able to detonate.""

Hall said the current plan for ET-MP is to transition the new grenades to Project Manager Close Combat Systems in fiscal year 2020.

JLTV DEBUT

The first seven joint light tactical vehicles were turned over to the Army and Marine Corps in late September by Oshkosh Defense for testing at different sites around the force.

The JLTV is a tactical wheeled vehicle with a chassis that offers protection from underbelly blasts and an ""intelligent"" suspension system that can be raised and lowered for off-road conditions. It also touts greater fuel efficiency than current tactical vehicles.

A total of about 100 of the JLTV production vehicles will be provided to the Army and Marine Corps for testing over the next year, at a rate of about 10 per month, officials said. The vehicles will undergo maneuverability and automotive testing at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, and other sites around the country.

""It's on schedule,"" said Scott Davis, program executive officer for combat support and combat service support, about the JLTV program. ""It's doing everything we ever expected it to. It's just incredible.""

ENTANGLED PHOTONS

At the Army Research Laboratory, scientists are looking at new ways to exploit the most fundamental or ""quantum"" component of light - the photon - to enhance communications, sensing and cryptography, and anything else they can think of.

""We don't really know what all the applications are. But our mandate, in part, is to find those applications,"" said Michael Brodsky, a physical scientist at the Army Research Laboratory.

In October, Brodsky was setting up a new lab at the ARL, located about 12 miles north of the Pentagon in Adelphi, Maryland. He has boxes there that generate entangled photons - the smallest measure of light.

A single photon, on its own, can be captured in a memory unit - or ""quantum storage"" - and subsequently measured. But when two entangled photons are captured and measured in the same way, Brodsky said, they yield the same measurements every time.

Those same two entangled protons could be split up, on different sides of the lab, on different sides of a research campus, or on different sides of the country, and still, because they are entangled, behave in the same way and yield the same measurements.

The results of those measurements are unpredictable and can be converted to a string of zeros and ones, Brodsky said, but ""you get identical strings of zeros and ones at two remote locations. Which, for instance, could be used as a key for secure communications.""

Using entangled photons for secure networking is just one of challenges that ARL is working on now. They are researching other ways to use entangled photons, such as enhancing sensors and quantum computing.

NEW ARMORED VEHICLE

The first armored multipurpose vehicle, or AMPV, was handed over to the Army Dec. 15 to begin a 52-month engineering and manufacturing development phase.

At least 29 of the vehicles will be manufactured for this phase of the procurement process, officials said. The AMPV is meant to replace the armored brigade combat team's M113 family of vehicles and addresses the M113's shortcomings in survivability and force protection, as well as size, weight, power and cooling.

The AMPV has a brand new hull but maintains some of the Bradley legacy design, allowing for some compatibility efficiencies, according to Maj. Gen. David G. Bassett, program executive officer for Ground Combat Systems. In fact, about 60 to 70 percent of the parts are common with existing ground combat vehicles, Bassett said during a press conference in October.

The AMPV also has space inside to allow for the addition of new systems in the future, and it comes with an improved power train. The hull is stronger from a force protection perspective, too, he said.

If the low-rate production option for the AMPV is approved, procurement officials said several hundred of the vehicles will be manufactured for testing over the next four years.

HYDROGEN-POWERED VEHICLE

The Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center and General Motors unveiled an energy-efficient tactical vehicle that could one day save lives on the battlefield.

The ZH2 hydrogen-fuel-cell electric vehicle prototype was rolled out Oct. 3, during the Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting and Symposium. The ZH2 operates on hydrogen fuel instead of traditional diesel, which means it uses much less fuel than traditional tactical vehicles.

At idle, it is ""extremely efficient,"" according to Kevin Centeck, team leader for Non-Primary Power Systems, Ground Vehicle Power and Mobility Directorate, TARDEC.

The vehicle also has an extremely low acoustic signature, meaning it's very quiet. ""It's silent mobility, silent watch,"" Centeck said. ""You don't give away your position by turning on the engine.""

The ZH2 also has a radically reduced thermal signature because its engine doesn't operate as hot as a diesel engine, which means that enemy thermal sensors will be less likely to pick up the heat signature, allowing for improved stealth.

NEW TOURNIQUET

One of the latest advances in treating hemorrhaging on the battlefield is the ""junctional tourniquet,"" according to Lt. Gen. Nadja Y. West, surgeon general of the Army and commander of the Army Medical Command.

A medic or fellow Soldier can apply a traditional tourniquet to a person's limb, but can't use it to stop hemorrhaging in the abdomen, chest, groin, waist, pelvis or armpit, she explained Aug. 18, at a meeting of the Defense Writer's Group in Washington, D.C.

But a junctional tourniquet can be applied to wounds in ways not possible with conventional tourniquets.

Developed at the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Fort Dietrick, Maryland, the junctional tourniquet is essentially a belt with one or more inflatable air bladders that can be puffed up, somewhat like a blood-pressure cuff, to apply pressure to a wound.

The device can be deployed to stop hemorrhaging in about 60 seconds.

The junctional tourniquet is now being fielded to Soldiers in harm's way, but it's so new - just months since its fielding - that West hasn't yet been briefed on how many lives it has saved, though she believes the number will be significant over time.

IMPROVED TURBINE ENGINE

The improved turbine engine program, or ITEP, will develop a completely new engine that will likely one day replace those currently in use by the AH-64 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, according to Maj. Gen. William K. Gayler, commander, Army Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Rucker, Alabama

Degraded lift capability is especially problematic in areas where high-altitude, high-temperature flights are required, including nearly half of Afghanistan, Gayler said at the Army Aviation Association of America-sponsored 2016 Army Aviation Mission Solution Summit in Atlanta in April.

Using the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter as an example, Gayler explained that an average of about 78 pounds per year have been added annually. That weight includes increased protective gear, ammunition, new technologies and so on.

All of that weight affects speed, lift, range and maneuverability. Years ago, four Black Hawks could move a platoon, Gaylor pointed out. Now, it takes eight or nine and, by 2020 - assuming the linear weight increases continue at the current rate - it will take 15 to 20.

ITEP will return a lot of that lost capability, he believes. ""ITEP is critical,"" he said. ""We must get it right to buy back maneuverability.""

Brig. Gen. Bob Marion, Program Executive Officer-Aviation, said ITEP is a big deal for the Army and could someday be resident in about 85 percent of its platforms.

It also has the potential for achieving future vertical lift, or FVL, if not by means of the actual motor, then by pieces associated with the development of the technology, he said.

But engineering and manufacturing development won't begin until fiscal year 2024, with the first aircraft test slated for fiscal year 2026.

2430678487,"A Missouri Republican saw last year's debate over a proposed constitutional amendment that would have protected businesses that deny services to same-sex couples bring lawmakers to tears and grind legislative work to a halt. His potential solution: Take state government out of marriage completely.

""You can stop spending so much emotional energy on the issue, and we can move on to other things,"" state Rep. T.J. Berry said, adding, ""I'm treating everybody the exact same way and leaving space for people to believe what they believe outside of government.""

His bill, filed ahead of the 2017 legislative session, would make Missouri the first state to recognize only domestic unions for both heterosexual and gay couples, treating legal partnerships equally and leaving marriages to be done by pastors and other religious leaders.

But such peace could be elusive for several reasons. Some argue that leaving marriage to religious leaders is a way to constitutionally refuse to perform ceremonies for same-sex couples. Plus, there are potential logistical issues with stripping references to marriage in hundreds of state statutes, and the federal government recognizes only marriages for benefits. Berry's idea has been met by skepticism from pretty much all sides of the gay marriage issue.

Other states including Alabama, Indiana and Michigan failed to pass similar bills to limit the government's role in marriage, and Oklahoma representatives passed a bill that didn't make it out of the Senate.

The Missouri bill's chances are unclear, although Republican House Majority Floor Leader Mike Cierpiot, who lives 30 minutes south of Kansas City in Lee's Summit, said the issue needs to be discussed due to impassioned arguments among LGBT rights groups and religious organizations that have continued in the wake of the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

The bill is backed by states' rights group Tenth Amendment Center, whose spokesman Mike Maharrey called it a ""great compromise"" and referenced county clerks in other states, such as Kentucky, who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

""It removes that type of battle of conscience,"" he said.

While the bill ""would treat all couples the same"" - at least in Missouri - the legal director for the national LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign highlighted a significant issue. The federal government does not recognize domestic partnerships or other alternative unions, so Missouri's same-sex and opposite-sex couples would need to get married in another state to receive federal benefits regarding taxation, social security and military spousal benefits, Sarah Warbelow said.

Berry, who's from Kearney, about 30 minutes north of Kansas City, said he's seeking guidance from the federal government.

The bill also doesn't address the heart of tension between religious groups and gay rights groups: whether same-sex couples should have the right to wed.

Members of the Missouri Baptist Convention are concerned that endorsing Berry's measure would be seen as accepting the Supreme Court's ruling, policy director Don Hinkle said.

""We believe that the Bible is literally the words of God, and we're to keep his commandments,"" Hinkle said. ""And he makes it very clear that marriage is to be only between a man and a woman.""

Democratic House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty said the issue was settled at the federal level, calling the bill ""absolutely unnecessary."" She also warned that the whopping 386-page bill has unknown consequences, potentially causing problems for couples in domestic unions who move out of state.

And there's the possibility that the measure could chip away at the significance of marriage.

""If you replace marriage with domestic union, will people still take that contract as seriously?"" Missouri Catholic Conference Executive Director Mike Hoey said.

Most Americans ""don't want marriage to disappear,"" Warbelow said.

""There is something about marriage,"" she said. ""People don't grow up dreaming about being in civil unions or domestic partnerships.""

2430740244,"Syndicated loan volumes in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, fell for the second consecutive year slipping to a three-year low of US$463.8bn in 2016 as slower economic growth and geopolitical turbulence curtailed bank lending despite a surge in M&A activity from China that boosted North Asian loans.

Lending in 2016 of US$463.8bn from 1,291 transactions, was down 1.6% from US$471.26bn in 2015, and is the lowest annual figure since 2013 when US$462bn was raised from 1,289 loans. Fourth-quarter 2016 volume of US$103.14bn was also the lowest fourth-quarter tally since 2012 and 1.85% lower year on year.

China, Asia's largest syndicated loan market, (ex-Japan), led the market with a wave of event-driven financings backing China Inc's overseas acquisition spree. It pushed M&A lending in 2016 to US$80.8bn, equalling the previous record set in 2007 and almost 70% higher compared with US$47.86bn raised for the segment in 2015.

""The loan market in 2016 has been supported by a significant increase in M&A activity, with a broader universe of Chinese corporates in particular being very acquisitive and completing jumbo-sized, cross-border acquisitions as they look to acquire technology and grow outside of their home market,"" said Amit Lakhwani, head of loan syndicate & distribution, Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank.

Asian lending and M&A deals in particular, received a huge fillip with a US$12.7bn bridge loan for China National Chemical Corp's (ChemChina) massive SFr43bn (US$43.45bn) bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides company Syngenta AG, which was the global M&A highlight of a volatile year.

The recourse financing was the largest from Asia (ex-Japan) and was part of a bigger US$32.9bn debt package supporting ChemChina's acquisition, which still requires regulatory approvals. The debt also included a US$20.2bn non-recourse bridge loan at the Syngenta level.

While Asian and European lenders participated in the recourse and non-recourse loans, opportunities for international banks to lend in event-driven loans for Chinese state-owned enterprises are shrinking as Chinese banks continue to step forward to lead the strategic segment.

""In 2016, we have observed the deal-corridor narrowing for foreign banks wishing to play in the corporate and LBO acquisition space, with the Chinese and Taiwanese banks playing a far more predominant role across the board,"" said Lyndon Hsu, head of leveraged and acquisition finance, Asia Pacific at HSBC.

Some privately-owned Chinese companies used foreign lenders for their overseas forays. Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd raised US$3.5bn in an acquisition financing in October from a group of 17 international and Chinese banks for its purchase of Finnish mobile gaming firm Supercell Oy.

The acquisition was Tencent's largest and also the world's largest buyout of a game developer. The financing was the borrower's debut M&A loan and followed the completion of two plain vanilla loans with tight pricing only a few months earlier.

The financings backing ChemChina and Tencent's acquisitions, among others, boosted Hong Kong's loan volumes, which is a centre for offshore Chinese borrowings. Loan volume in the territory hit a record US$106bn, showing a 22% rise in 2016. China and Hong Kong were the only Asian loan markets to register activity of more than US$100bn, although overall China volumes fell 9.1% to US$135bn in 2016 despite the record M&A boost as the economic slowdown in the country took its toll. LIMITED GROWTH India was the star among major Asian loan markets, showing the biggest percentage increase in 2016, as the country's borrowers tapped offshore loans frequently with state-owned oil and gas companies and pharmaceutical companies raising funds for overseas acquisitions.

Indian offshore borrowing of US$21.25bn in 61 deals was 37% higher than 2015's tally. Indonesian companies also relied heavily on foreign currency borrowing, which lifted the country's 2016 total to US$12.58bn, almost 50% higher than in 2015. Both markets reversed declines seen in 2015 as their corporates offered welcome diversification from lending to China, which has dominated regional lending since 2013.

Japan posted an 8.5% increase in volumes to US$234.67bn, compared with US$216.33bn in 2015, as borrowers sought to lock in cheap long-term funding using hybrid loans in a negative interest rate environment.

Taiwan saw the biggest annual decline in 2016, dropping 27% to US$34bn as corporates grappled with a slowing economy, mirroring similar issues in neighbouring China. Loans from Greater China of US$285.22bn in 2016 were 2.1% lower than US$291.28bn raised in 2015.

Australia saw lower activity for the second year in a row with lending dropping 8.4% to US$72.8bn in 2016, while Singapore was flat at US$38.68bn.

Other Asian blue chip firms followed Tencent's example and were also able to reduce their borrowing costs tapping into a deal-starved investor base.

Several high-grade credits including Chinese oil behemoth CNOOC Ltd, Indian state-owned oil & gas bellwether ONGC Videsh Ltd and financial services giant Blackstone Group, among others, visited the loan markets more than once during the year to raise funds, either for refinancing or for acquisitions.

""Liquidity conditions remained strong throughout the year, however subdued deal flow resulted in most loan investors struggling for assets to meet budgets. This supply-demand imbalance led to significantly competitive behaviour, which resulted in pricing tightening across most markets, with structures becoming looser and tenors being pushed out,"" said Lakhwani.

The year also saw rare borrowers such as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Hong Kong rail operator MTR Corp Ltd and Airport Authority Hong Kong, Malaysian banks Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd , Indian mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp, state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia, among others, giving lenders opportunities to gain exposure to quality credits.

Most of these borrowers returned to the loan markets after several years to take advantage of lower pricing and abundant bank liquidity. Sri Lanka made an impressive return to the loan markets in September after an eight year absence to sign its largest syndicated facility after increasing a three-year loan to US$700m from a targeted size of up to US$500m.

Earlier in March, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Government of Mongolia also tapped loan markets, while the Independent State of Papua New Guinea followed in November with a debut US$200m five-year borrowing that is expected to be launched into syndication in January. ROAD AHEAD While Asian borrowers enjoyed benign loan market conditions in 2016, the year ahead poses more potential threats as the full impact of Britain's vote to exit the European Union, Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential elections and the US Federal Reserve's move to increase interest rates plays out across global financial markets.

Industry participants are bracing for a different year in 2017 amid expectations of a further drop in China-related borrowing as the country continues to grapple with a slowing economy.

""After a lukewarm 2016 for the loan market dominated by China-linked issuance, 2017 looks set to be different with an expected rise in deal volumes from Southeast Asia and India and potentially lower China volumes, influenced by talk of greater control on capital flows and a slowdown in outbound M&A activity,"" said Amit Khattar, head of loan trading and syndication, Asia, at Deutsche Bank.

Meanwhile, lenders' focus to generate returns amid tepid deal flow will keep pressure on pricing, as banks review their strategies and higher funding costs force them to continue culling customers or pass costs on.

""Banks continue to have excess liquidity to deploy and report that they are short on assets, meaning these conditions will continue into 2017, absent any major event,"" said Lakhwani.

""Loan pricing especially in US dollars could see a mild increase from 2016 reflecting increased US dollar cost of funds, while liquidity from investors will remain robust,"" said Khattar.

2430889305,"Imagine a campaign manager working for two opposing candidates. Or a law firm attempting to defend both plaintiff and defendant. People and companies tend to steer clear of such arrangements and their inherent conflicts of interest, whether inspired by statute or common sense. But the business of real estate has for decades operated knee deep in dueling allegiances, to the dismay of some tenants who come up short when brokerages represent both buyers and sellers. With a recent court decision, that practice--""Dual Agency""--may now be trickier to pull off.

The California Supreme Court upheld a lower court's ruling in November confirming that a listing broker has a fiduciary responsibility to the buyer and the seller when his brokerage firm is representing both, setting a significant precedent for obtaining and sharing information in residential and commercial transactions. The case, Horikke v. Coldwell Banker, concerns the purchase in 2007 of a $12.25 million Malibu mansion by a Hong Kong businessman (Hiroshi Horikke) who claimed that the square footage of the home was exaggerated, unbeknownst to him at the time of the sale. The figures given to Horikke were provided by the seller's agent and not corrected by the buyer's agent, both of whom were employed by Coldwell Banker.

Now, following the decision, such misinformation would have been squashed before the buyer actually paid for more house than he was getting or a corporate client lost millions in a bad leasing deal. While the specific case centered on a residential real estate dispute, the ruling may have implications in the commercial real estate space, where a majority of firms routinely represent both landlords and tenants.

""It's the beginning of a systematic change in our industry,"" said Jason Hughes, President and CEO of San Diego-based commercial real estate firm, Hughes Marino. ""The court confirmed that brokers have significant conflicts of interest when representing both tenant and landlords in transactions.""

To ensure that conflicts are minimized, real estate companies that participate in this complicated dance may need to make changes in how they operate, such as creating alternative categories of agency relationships, perhaps, and disclosing information to brokers that they previously wouldn't. Limiting these dual-broker transactions has some in the industry reeling. The California Association of Realtors, for instance, which represents more than 175,000 licensed real estate agents in the state, filed an amicus brief stating that consumer choices would be limited as a result of the court ruling.

Some brokerage firms, however, anticipate little adjustment. ""The limited decision in this case was consistent with the way JLL does business - we act in our clients' best interests with transparency and adherence to our high ethical standards, including full disclosure when we represent multiple clients in the same transaction, "" said Peter Belisle, Southwest Market Director for JLL, a Chicago-based commercial real estate company with 280 offices worldwide.

In California, brokers are required to supply an additional disclosure document to clients at the initial engagement. ""Though the guidelines are not that clear about when it is supposed to be presented, I understand philosophically why it is important on both sides, particularly with sales, when you are dealing with a transaction that is ending, versus leasing, which is ongoing,"" said Gabe Kadosh, Vice President, Retail Services, Colliers International. ""I tell my clients that I am really just a middle person, and I try to balance both sides.""

Firms that don't engage in dual agency business to begin with, of course, will have to do nothing to comply. Real estate companies that represent only tenants are already free of conflict. Some might argue that they provide an advantageous landscape for buyers, and have, always.

""We have known that these conflicting allegiances are an issue,"" said Gail Corder Fischer, Executive Vice Chairman of Fischer, a Dallas-based global corporate real estate firm that has represented tenants exclusively for 30 years. ""You'd never accept them in any other aspect of your business, so why would you when you are dealing with something as expensive as your lease? When there is no bias, there's never a question of whether or not a tenant got the best advice and deal.""

The buying, financing, managing, leasing and selling of real estate assets is a lucrative cycle that sellers' agents need and want to maintain, according to a 2014 Fischer report identifying how tenants lose out when agencies represent both parties. Also, natural biases cause people to gravitate in certain directions, the report claims, especially when they stand to benefit materially.

The Horikke ruling could have an impact on companies used to dual agency practices that went unquestioned, for the most part. ""You have a lot of brokers doing things their own ways, and any time you shift those ways, it could be a burden,"" said Kadosh, who added that more clients have asked him recently if it is appropriate that he represent both parties. ""It used to be a little more landlord-friendly, but this creates more awareness for tenants.""

To help both tenant and landlord feel the transaction is fair and transparent, according to Kadosh, brokers may come up with certain caveats in deal structures, word agreements in certain ways or have parties provide tax returns, sales returns and other data, especially with large institutional clients.

""I'm not sure how large brokerage firms are going to continue doing business as usual,"" said Katie R. Jones, attorney with California-based Miller Starr Regalia, ""while adequately representing both sides of a transaction.""

2430981361,"Working over the New Year's holiday weekend, robot arm operators at the Johnson Space Center will begin a complex procedure to replace 12 aging batteries in the International Space Station's solar power system with six state-of-the-art lithium-ion power packs, a multi-step process over the next two weeks that will require two spacewalks to complete.

Without the remotely-controlled arm operations, it would take six spacewalks to carry out the battery swap out. But arm operators in Houston, starting New Year's Eve, will swap out three batteries before Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson venture outside on Jan. 6 to continue the work.

After additional robot arm operations, Kimbrough and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet will carry out a second spacewalk Jan. 13 before a final round of robot arm operations Jan. 14 and 15.

It is the most complex remotely controlled robot arm work yet implemented aboard the space station, an intricate, multi-step, multi-shift procedure that resembles a shell game of sorts, with old and new batteries moving to and fro between a cargo pallet, temporary mounting fixtures and a solar array electronics unit.

The space station is equipped with four huge sets of solar arrays that slowly rotate to track the sun as the laboratory circles the Earth. Each set of arrays powers two of the station's eight electrical buses and each set of arrays is equipped with 12 nickel-hydrogen batteries to provide electricity when the lab is in Earth's shadow.

Station assembly began in 1998 and the original-equipment batteries are losing strength. So, over the next few years, all 48 of the nickel-hydrogen batteries will be replaced with 24 smaller, more efficient lithium-ion batteries that will keep the station in good health through its remaining life.

The first set of six replacement batteries was carried to the station aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship that reached the lab complex Dec. 13. Flight controllers in Houston used the station's robot arm, equipped with a multi-appendage hand-like special purpose dexterous manipulator, or SPDM, to remove a pallet carrying the new batteries on Dec. 14.

The pallet then was maneuvered to the right side of the station's power truss and temporarily mounted near the inboard starboard 4, or S4, set of arrays powering electrical channels 1A and 3A. The S4 arrays, and their batteries, were launched in June 2007.

Along with carrying the six new batteries to the station, the pallet will be used to carry nine of the 12 older batteries away from the station. They will burn up, along with the HTV, when the cargo ship re-enters the atmosphere after departing the station. Three of the older batteries will be left in storage aboard the lab.

Six adapter plates also were carried up on the HTV, three for electrical channel 1A and three for channel 3A. The adapter plates feature cables and circuitry to connect the new lithium-ion batteries to the station's power grid. The three nickel-hydrogen batteries remaining on the station will be mounted atop three of the adapter plates.

Starting New Year's Eve and continuing through Jan. 3, arm operators in Houston plan to begin the channel 3A work, moving three lithium-ion batteries from the HTV pallet to the integrated electronics assembly, or IEA, at the base of the S4 arrays. Three nickel-hydrogen batteries will be installed on the HTV pallet while a fourth will be temporarily mounted on a SPDM attachment fixture.

During U.S. EVA-38 on Jan. 6, Kimbrough and Whitson will complete the channel 3A swap-out, moving three adapter plates to the IEA and mounting two of the three nickel-hydrogen batteries that will remain in place atop those plates. Three lithium-ion batteries will already be in place thanks to earlier robotic arm operations.

Starting Jan. 8 and continuing through Jan. 12, arm operators will focus on channel 1A. Three nickel-hydrogen batteries in the electronics assembly will be moved to the HTV pallet and two more will be temporarily mounted on the SPDM. Three lithium-ion batteries will be moved from the pallet to the electronics assembly.

Kimbrough and Pesquet then will venture outside on Jan. 13, moving an adapter plate and one of the older batteries to the IEA. At this point, the three nickel-hydrogen batteries that will remain aboard the station will be in their designated positions. The astronauts will move two more adapter plates to the IEA.

Robot arm operators then will finish the battery replacement work on Jan. 14 and 15, moving the three nickel-hydrogen batteries mounted on the SPDM and a nearby attachment fitting to the HTV pallet. The pallet will be moved back to the HTV and mounted in its unpressurized cargo bay on Jan. 17. The HTV is scheduled to depart the station on Jan. 27.

With the battery replacement work out of the way, the station crew will focus on research as Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and flight engineer Sergey Borisenko wind up their stay in orbit before returning to Earth in late February.

Their replacements, Soyuz MS-04 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA flight engineer Jack Fischer, are expected to launch at the end of March.

The Russians have not yet revealed the results of an investigation to find out what triggered the loss of a Progress cargo ship Dec. 1 or what impact that might have on downstream flights.

2431000763,"Khemaridh Hy did the unthinkable.

In 2015, at age 35, the rising star quit a very lucrative Wall Street career. He didn't have another job lined up -- or even a real game plan of exactly what he was going to do.

Co-workers thought he was nuts. His own parents, immigrants to the U.S. from Cambodia and France, kept asking him when he was going back to work.

But Khemaridh Hy (who goes by ""Khe,"" pronounced ""Kay"") looked around his fancy New York office and realized something: More money wasn't making him happier. So many people he knew on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley believed if they could ""just make"" another $1 million or $10 million or $100 million, they would be set and life would be great.

Except, for Hy, that was a lie.

So Hy, a computer science whiz kid who graduated from Yale and shot up the Wall Street ranks to be a managing director at BlackRock's hedge fund of funds division, gave it all up to figure out how to live ""a more fulfilled life.""

""Nothing prepares you to see your bank account go down,"" admits Hy, who is now 37 and wears polka dot sweaters, jeans and neon blue Nike shoes. ""Even if it was going down from a big number, it still f--ks with your head."" Ask yourself the hard questions

Hy and his wife Lisa took their baby daughter and traveled. He learned to meditate . He started a journal. He spent true quality time with his daughter. And he read everything he could about how to live a better life.

It was his family's version of ""Eat Pray Love,"" except Hy calls it ""Uncomfortable Introspection."" He compares it to going to the gym. It's not fun every day, but over time, you see a visible change.

""My happiness is now between a 9 or 9.5 on a 10-point scale,"" says Hy. On Wall Street, he thinks he never got above 6.5. A big promotion or bonus would cause a happiness spike that disappeared within days.

Hy started writing a weekly newsletter called ""Rad Reads"" while on vacation in early 2015 as he was contemplating leaving BlackRock. He would highlight the best 5 things he read or watched that week and give a short summary of his key ""life hack"" takeaways. He sent Rad Reads to about 40 friends and colleagues. Nearly everyone replied.

""People loved it. I thought, 'Oh my God, this is awesome,'"" says Hy, who comes across as humble despite his success. He's open about his failures -- everything from his iPhone addiction (he's ) to his irrational fear of going broke (his wife had to tell him to stop ordering the cheapest beer on the menu every time they went out).

Rad Reads grew rapidly. People would tell friends, ""This is an email you'll actually want to read.""

Hy says he now has 4,500 subscribers. That may not sound like a lot, but his readers are some of the top stars in tech and finance. Many are in their 20s and 30s. They see Hy as a life coach of sorts -- almost a Millennial version of Oprah. Overcoming your fear of failure

""We call him an 'honorary Millennial,'"" jokes Kunal Tandon, a venture capital consultant in New York who met Hy at a gathering for tech founders in an East Village bar. ""He speaks our language. In a way, he speaks it better than us.""

The Rad Reads emails arrive with subject lines like ""From Hustle to Wholeness"" and ""Fear of Failure."" His motto is ""Be your best self.""

The emails are geared toward type-A overachivers. Hy acknowledges that he's speaking to a mostly privileged audience that isn't living paycheck to paycheck, although he's tried to force his readers to question their biases and bubble mindsets.

His biggest realization is that fear -- especially the fear of failure or running out of money -- holds so many people back from doing what they really want to do in life. Even in his own life, he and his wife budgeted for a two-year break, a deadline that is approaching. .

""We're all busybodies, scurrying through the week. Rad Reads is homework Khe has done on our behalf,"" says Khee Lee, an ex-Googler and Rad Reads subscriber. How to turn an idea into success

A year and a half after Hy left Wall Street, no one thinks he's crazy anymore.

He gave a TEDx talk in London in October. Several top businesses, including hedge funds, have asked him to speak to their workers about what he's learned on his life journey the past two years. He's active on Snapchat, dishing out daily advice, including his belief that taking extremely cold showers is the ideal way to stimulate the mind in the morning.

Business news site Quartz hired Hy to be their first ever ""professional in residence"" in September to write ""about productivity and the nature of work"" and put together an event. Hy already organizes regular Happy Hours and volunteer gigs for Rad Readers to connect in real life. The Happy Hours are ""amazing,"" says Tandon. ""I met a founder of a startup, a journalist, a hedge fund manager, a nonprofit director."" Tandon credits Hy with teaching him to ask better questions and talk to people about more interesting things than just day jobs.

Hy is a natural connector, he says. Within a few minutes of meeting you, he will say, ""You should meet so-and-so. I'll introduce you.""

In an era when so many Millennials are changing jobs -- and even entire careers -- that kind of networking is coveted. What to do in 2017

Hy doesn't think people have to follow in his footsteps and quit their jobs. Instead, he wants people to take four steps:

1. Have more compassion -- for yourself and others. Hy says he would beat himself up if everything in his day didn't go perfectly. Now, he has more of a glass half-full approach. He doesn't let little things blow up his day.

2. Do the ""Uncomfortable Introspection."" Hy says you have to figure out what you're afraid of and learn to set it aside so it doesn't impact your decision making. For some, this may take meditation. For others, it may come through therapy or journaling.

3. Get comfortable with stillness. Hy has come to value ""quiet space."" It's become more necessary than ever to unplug for a few minutes a day. He actually taught himself to meditate on super crowded New York subway cars and made his iPhone password extremely complex to prevent himself from checking his phone so much.

4. Live your truth. When you know yourself and what you really want, you finally stop living for money and prestige. It's freeing, but Hy knows it's hard. He now makes a living as a writer and speaker, yet he still has trouble calling himself a writer. He has plenty of moments of doubt where he still feels like a pretender.

""I was an emotional couch potato for 35 years,"" he says from his desk at Quartz. ""I have not lost my edge just because I meditate, cry and have dinner by 6pm now.""

2431141051,"It wouldn't be a bad opening for a Tom Clancy novel about the Cold War:

Without warning, American agents descend on a Russian-owned compound in rural Maryland. A similar surprise unfolds at an estate on New York's Long Island. Both locations are accused of hosting Russian spies on American soil, and once again, two nuclear powers stand at each other's throats.

Except there's no need to dramatize, nor any need to set the story in the past. All this happened Thursday, as American officials punished the Russian government on allegations of hacking Democratic officials to influence the recent presidential election.

The measures ordered by President Obama included the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic officials accused of working as intelligence officers, plus sanctions against Russian cyber agents and firms accused of supporting hacking of the Democratic National Committee.

But it's Obama's order to shut down two Russian-owned mansions - best known as quiet getaways for diplomatic apparatchiks - that has raised eyebrows the most.

On Maryland's Eastern Shore, about 60 miles east of the nation's capital, a three-story, red-brick mansion and almost a dozen cottages sit on the banks of the Corsica River.

The Soviet Union bought the property in 1972 and transferred it to the Russian Federation in the 1990s, and the 45-acre compound also holds tennis courts, a swimming pool and playground equipment. It's mostly known to the local community of Centreville for hosting parties and sailing regattas on Labor Day, if it's known at all.

""If you didn't know they were here, you wouldn't know they were here,"" said George Sigler, president of Centreville's town council and a retired Marine, describing the compound as a place where Russians working in the embassy in Washington could ""come to let their hair down and relax.""

The ordered shutdown of the compound caught Sigler by surprise. He had never recalled hearing of anything suspicious happening there, nor of Russian guests misbehaving in the community, where they would shop, eat, get haircuts and buy groceries and alcohol; one local liquor store had stocked up on vodka to serve Russian customers.

Sigler recalled visiting the property for a Labor Day picnic last year and ""drinking copious amounts of Russian vodka.""

Sigler said he mentioned to the Russian ambassador that he didn't think he could get vodka like that in the U.S. The next day, a Russian aide arrived at Centreville City Hall with a couple of bottles.

""They're good neighbors, and have been the whole time they've been there,"" Sigler said.

After Obama ordered the compounds closed Thursday, a woman who flashed an FBI badge and a man who said he worked for the State Department shooed people away from the Maryland property, the Baltimore Sun reported. A 14-acre property in Upper Brookville, Long Island, was also ordered closed.

At a news briefing , Obama administration officials did not give details on what kind of spying allegedly happened at the compounds in Maryland and Long Island, except that they ""were used for intelligence collection activities"" as well as for recreation. (Part of the administration's justification for the mansion closures included complaints that U.S. diplomats were being harassed and mistreated in Russia.)

Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin complained that the sites were popular getaways for diplomats' families.

""I think it's quite scandalous that they chose to throw out our kids,"" Churkin said, according to the Associated Press. ""They know full well that those two facilities they mentioned, they are vacation facilities for our kids, and this is Christmas, and this is vacation time for our schools. This is the time when the kids go to those facilities. So to close our access to them just while those holidays were starting, to me was rather silly.""

During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union restricted the movements of each others' visiting diplomats, requiring them to stick to certain parts of the countries. A high-ranking Soviet defector, the diplomat Arkady N. Shevchenko, said at least one of the Russian-owned mansions on Long Island served double duty as electronic surveillance posts for the Soviet Union's intelligence agency, the KGB.

""When I first came to the United States in 1958, there were three or four KGB communications technicians and their gear sharing the former servants' quarters in the attic,"" Shevchenko wrote of the Soviets' Killenworth mansion on Long Island in a 1985 memoir, ""Breaking with Moscow.""

""By 1973, the specialists in intercepting radio signals numbered at least a dozen, and they had taken over the whole floor,"" wrote Shevchenko. ""Their equipment occupied so much space, in fact, that one of the two large unused greenhouses had been commandeered to store it. These quarters were off limits to other personnel.""

Shevchenko, who died in 1998, also told the Norwich Bulletin newspaper that the Soviets were pleased after buying the Maryland compound in 1972 and added that the property's location was ""not accidental.""

""I'm not privy to the details, but I remember how happy they were when they bought this estate,"" Shevchenko reportedly said .

If there was spying going on in Maryland, it may have gone both ways. Soviet officials once complained to U.S. officials that they found a special cable and a special device attached to the compound's internal phone system in 1977.

On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the sanctions package ""provocative and aimed at further weakening the Russia-U.S. relationship.""

But this was not the same old Cold War story. While Putin's foreign minister had called for Russia to expel an equal number of American diplomats and close their dacha outside Moscow in addition to another facility, Putin said he would not retaliate, instead hoping to ""restore Russian-U.S. relations based on the policies of the Trump administration.""

President-elect Donald Trump responded by pinning a congratulatory tweet to the top of his Twitter page: ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" The Russian embassy in the U.S., in turn, retweeted Trump's message.

In Centreville, Md., comments on the residents' Facebook page were mostly critical of Obama's decision to shut down the Russian compound, according to Sigler, who also had his doubts about the spying claims.

""Were they spying on anybody? I wouldn't know why. It's just a sleepy little town on a sleepy little river,"" Sigler said, adding, ""Once this all blows over, they'll probably come back.""

The hottest year in history sees the election of a new president who questions climate science

In a slap at Obama, Putin plays Mr. Nice Guy

"
2431301240,"Science never ceases to surprise us. In a year jampacked with discoveries, some of the biggest revelations of 2016 seemed to come from out of the blue.

Just a few weeks in, the astronomer responsible for demoting Pluto to a dwarf planet said there is a ninth planet in the solar system after all - an object about 10 times as massive as Earth that takes up to 20,000 years to orbit the sun.

Soon after, cosmologists announced that their decades-long search for gravity waves had finally paid off, allowing them to confirm a 100-year-old prediction made by none other than Albert Einstein.

Zika morphed from an obscure virus to an international scourge, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a public health emergency and sparking a torrent of research on medicines and vaccines that are now in clinical trials.

So perhaps it's a bit reckless to make predictions about where science will take us in 2017. Still, we can't help feeling excited about some of the stories we expect in the new year. You can preview them here, then follow them with us at latimes.com/science .

How science will fare under the Trump administration

Donald Trump won't be sworn in for a few more weeks, but associates of the incoming president have been making moves that have some scientists on edge.

Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, claims that scientists aren't sure that global warming is real or that human activities have played a role. In truth, there is an overwhelming consensus among scientists that ""climate change is occurring, and ... that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver."" In addition, managers at the Department of Energy have been asked to identify employees who conducted climate change research, a request likened to a ""witch hunt.""

Plenty of people also are on edge over reports that Trump is considering Silicon Valley investor Jim O'Neill to run the Food and Drug Administration. Speaking at a biotechnology conference in 2014, O'Neill argued that drug companies should not have to prove that their products are effective in order to win FDA approval - only that they are safe. While such a move would make more medicines available to patients, they wouldn't know - at least at first - whether those medicines actually work.

Thousands of scientists have signed an open letter to Trump (and the incoming Congress) urging the federal government to ""rely on science as a key input for crafting public policy."" If budget cuts or industry influence prevent scientists from doing their work, ""children will be more vulnerable to lead poisoning, more people will be exposed to unsafe drugs and medical devices, and we will be less prepared to limit the impacts of increasing extreme weather and rising seas.""

The great American eclipse

On Aug. 21, a total eclipse of the sun will be visible from the continental United States for the first time in 38 years, and for sky watchers and scientists alike, it's going to be a VERY. BIG. DEAL.

A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun so that it appears to completely block the shining disk of our life-giving star. The phenomenon itself is not especially rare - it happens about once every 18 months - but total eclipses are visible only from small swaths of the planet at a time. Because most of the Earth is covered in ocean, hard-core eclipse chasers often find themselves heading to remote islands to catch a glimpse of the celestial event.

But not this year. The 2017 eclipse's narrow path of totality cuts across the United States, beginning in Salem, Ore., and ending in Charleston, S.C., making it just a one- or two-day drive for hundreds of millions of Americans. Because of this accessibility, it promises to be the most-viewed and photographed eclipse of all time.

For scientists, the eclipse offers an opportunity to study the sun's atmosphere, which usually is blocked by the bright light coming from the sun itself. NASA already is gearing up to observe the eclipse with at least half a dozen instruments - high-altitude weather balloons included.

Finale of Cassini mission to Saturn

The coming year will close out the final dramatic chapter for NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which has twirled around Saturn and its panoply of moons since 2004.

Among its many accomplishments, Cassini has caught icy moon Enceladus squirting geysers of water ice and vapor , and found evidence of an ocean beneath its frozen surface. It has picked out hydrocarbon lakes and canyons carved by methane on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. It also has picked up hints of moonlets being born and ripped apart in the planet's chaotic F ring.

In late November, the spacecraft began its ring-grazing orbits, allowing it to check out the hexagon-shaped jet stream that rings the planet's north pole. These 20 orbits will allow it to zip past some of Saturn's icy rings, sampling gas and dust particles. Then, in April, it will begin the grand finale orbits - 22 loops that will send the spacecraft through the gap between the rings and the planet's spherical body.

The ring-grazing and grand finale orbits will shed unprecedented information on the composition and mass of the rings and, ultimately, their evolution.

But Cassini's fuel supplies are dwindling, and scientists want to make sure it does not crash into and contaminate a potentially habitable world like Enceladus (or even Titan). So in September, the spacecraft will dive into Saturn, where it will send back data until it succumbs to the gas giant's unforgiving upper atmosphere.

""It's kind of a nice picture,"" Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker told The Times earlier. After studying the gas giant for 13 years, she explained, ""here's a chance for Cassini's molecules to become a part of Saturn.""

Juno dives deeper into Jupiter mission

Cassini no longer is the only spacecraft circling a gas giant. July Fourth saw the arrival of NASA's Juno satellite at Jupiter - a mission designed to probe basic questions about our largest planet and the secrets it may hold about the early solar system.

Among the mysteries Juno may help solve: what powers Jupiter's powerful (and damaging) magnetic field; what the planet's core is made of; and how much water lies hidden beneath its thick atmosphere.

Ultimately, because of Jupiter's damaging radiation environment, Juno also will be forced to plummet into the planet's atmosphere, as Cassini will for Saturn. Scientists do not want to risk the spacecraft falling into Europa, an enormous icy moon that also may hide a potentially habitable ocean. This, however, won't be on the table until 2018.

Juno started out in long 53-day orbits, which gives the spacecraft a close look at the planet roughly every 7.5 weeks; once its human handlers safely settle the spacecraft into much shorter 14-day orbits next year, expect a relative firehouse of scientific findings to start pouring in.

Who will get credit for inventing key gene-editing technology?

It's the hottest tool in biology, and two research teams are locked in a fierce battle over who made the essential discovery - and thus may lay claim to key patent rights.

The tool in question is the gene-editing system known as CRISPR-Cas9 . It's made from a small piece of RNA that targets a specific genetic sequence and a protein that breaks the sequence in a precise spot so that a new piece of code can be spliced in. Though it sounds complicated, it has greatly simplified the process of editing the DNA of living organisms. Scientists hope it will help them fix mutations that contribute to diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's, among many others.

The inventors of CRISPR-Cas9 are considered likely candidates for a Nobel Prize , and their universities could reap billions of dollars in licensing fees. But who are the rightful inventors? UC Berkeley claims they are its own Jennifer Doudna and collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who made the system work in test tubes in 2012. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard claims it's Feng Zhang , a bioengineer at MIT who used it in human and mouse cells a few months later in 2013. Both sides have filed patents for the technology.

The acrimonious legal dispute reached an important milestone in December with a hearing in front of a three-judge panel for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It was the only chance for the two sides to make their case in person. A ruling is expected in 2017.

TESS begins hunt for nearby planets

TESS, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is set to launch in December 2017 and will search the sky for exoplanets - particularly those that could be in their home star's habitable zone.

In many ways the successor to NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope, TESS also will use the transit method to pick out planets by the light they block as they pass in front of their stars. But unlike Kepler, which stared at a tiny patch of the heavens, TESS will be scanning 400 times as much sky as its predecessor.

The new spacecraft's targets also will be somewhat different from the original Kepler mission's: Whereas Kepler peered deep into that single spot, finding planets near and far, TESS will search for nearby planets around relatively brighter stars - making them easier for follow-up study with other telescopes.

That kind of follow-up could allow astronomers to characterize the planets' mass using ground-based telescopes, and thus determine their density and find out whether they have a rocky surface, like Earth. It also could allow future telescopes (such as the James Webb Space Telescope, set for launch in 2018) to study the planet's atmosphere.

Cool research in space

Some pretty cool research is on tap for 2017.

As early as April, NASA will dispatch the Cold Atom Laboratory to the International Space Station. Once it's operational, the lab will become one of the coldest places in the entire universe, with gases chilled to a mere billionth of a degree above absolute zero.

That's the kind of temperature it takes to practically freeze elements like rubidium and potassium, giving scientists a better shot at studying how their atoms behave at a quantum level. The microgravity environment of the space station also will help because it will give scientists more time to observe these atoms in an exotic state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.

The ultimate goal is to test the laws of quantum mechanics and gain insight into this mysterious branch of physics. The Cold Atom Lab was developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge.

"
2431309321,"As 2016 gives way to the new year, tech trend-watchers are looking ahead to the innovations that will impact our daily lives in the not-too-distant future. Will 2017 be the year when the self-driving car really takes off? Will companies like Apple continue to dominate consumers' wish lists, or will new startups emerge to challenge the larger, more established brands? For every groundbreaking development that comes along to shift the ways people live their lives, there are plenty of examples like virtual reality - buzzy tech that flooded news feeds and found a place on every ""tech trends of 2016"" list - that have yet to live up to the all the hype.

CBS News asked some experts for their thoughts on how technology might make its mark in 2017. Shift in consumer tech

2017 may be a year when we continue to see innovative updates to already existing tech rather than a big, splashy new device that makes waves. The era of the ""one, big, monumental 'thing' that everyone is focused on"" seems to have hit a ""plateau,"" CNET senior editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News.

""You know, we are at the point when even the coolest, most exciting phone that came out hit a plateau in development. You see things like laptops have this continued evolution,"" Ackerman said of the focus on updates to what has already been on the market.

One thing that Ackerman said to look out for is the rise of the self-driving car. Autonomous vehicles have certainly been in the headlines lately. Just before Christmas, Uber shifted its self-driving car pilot program from San Francisco to Arizona as communities continue to struggle with how to regulate this radical new approach on the roads.

Ackerman said that, despite these setbacks, 2017 could be the year when self-driving cars become more present.

Play Video CBS Evening News Apple on the rise after releasing newest iPhone The iPhone 7 went on sale Friday after selling out all of their inventory in presale orders. Apple expects to sell 226 million phones in the next... ""Expect to see a ton of developments in terms of automatic tech and car tech,"" Ackerman added. ""As a New Yorker, I don't think about having a car, but the only kind of car I would have is a self-driving car. For skeptics, it's very important seeing them on the streets. They're much faster that anyone could predicted. I think we're on the cusp of having them be a thing. Of course, Uber had to withdraw them from San Francisco, but you're going to see a lot of interest in that space very soon.""

Another piece of consumer technology Ackerman thinks will really take off this year is the OLED TV. These high-end televisions could be the trend that will be most visible in everyday households. For those not familiar, televisions that use OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) have even better picture quality than standard HDTVs.

""OLED TV is nothing new, but they will be much more mainstream next year,"" Ackerman predicted. ""When we first saw OLED TV, you know, the technology blew us away at CES maybe four or five years ago. But it was just a handful of very high-end TVs. Hopefully 2017 is the year they will be less expensive and get more mainstream-priced."" The rise of artificial intelligence

From Siri and Cortana to cybersecurity, smart homes and even smart toys, artificial intelligence has increasingly found a place in a wide range of industries and applications. For Sergey Gribrov, a partner at Flint Capital, a venture capital fund that focuses on businesses in VR and augmented realty among other fields, AI will start to move ""big data"" aggregation in a direction of making people's day-to-day lives easier.

""You have AI in cybersecurity, for instance, where AI can be used to predict cyberattacks. Look at AI with wearable devices where it is looking at wide amounts of data, culling that information, and synthesizing it quickly. You're now moving in a direction where AI is using this data aggregation and using it to make predictions,"" Gibrov told CBS News.

While Gibrov chatted on the phone, he accidentally activated his Alexa, Amazon's digital personal assistant that is used through the Amazon Echo speaker device. For Gibrov, it was a funny accident that underscored a point - AI has become pretty ubiquitous already in a way that no longer seems like science fiction.

Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime Charlie Rose interviews... a robot? What happens when Charlie Rose attempts to interview a robot named ""Sophia"" for his 60 Minutes report on artificial intelligence ""You know, you have AI telling you what your schedule is, what time you wake up. More and more, you have AI kind of helping you doing things in all aspects of life, at home and at work,"" he stressed. ""AI will start just analyzing data to predict the future. Look at self-driving cars - you go into your car and turn right, the AI in your car will know, will be able to predict where you would head as part of your routine. Maybe it knows where you are going to go shop. AI will help us guide us as we go on our ways.""

Of course, the arrival of ever-smarter machines prompts familiar concerns. As the legendary physicist Stephen Hawking once put it, AI could be either ""the best or worst thing ever to happen to humanity."" Will more advanced AI pose a threat to human agency? Gibrov said that is a common fear, but he views AI as the ultimate assistant - not a replacement for human decision-making.

""Hopefully, we will not get into a point when AI will replace people - I don't think that will happen. I think we will get AI to outsource what we don't want to do. People will have more time to do the things they enjoy doing. That's what I think we'll see even more of in 2017,"" he said.Social media in the year ahead

From the president-elect to teenagers bored in class, social media is pretty much used by everyone. For Victor Pineiro, vice president of social media at Brooklyn-based digital agency Big Spaceship, it is always difficult to predict exactly how people will adopt new trends or use existing platforms in the future.

""My favorite example is one of the saddest of social media trends. Vine died and went away,"" he said, referring to the Twitter-owned platform for making and sharing six-second videos. ""Vine is a good example of a social platform that everyone thought would be 'x' and it actually ended up being 'y.' It was supposed to be the video version of Twitter, but most people were actually taking in content made by just like 10 or 20 major influencers. It was a form of entertainment, it was 'TV'.""

For Pineiro, who in 2013 was named one of Business Insider's 30 most creative people in social media, the past year showed that people are moving toward being what he called ""passive content creators"" - a trend that looks to continue into 2017.

Play Video Sunday Morning The onslaught of fake news In these partisan, high-tech times, are the news stories we Americans read, see, and hear fact or fiction? Senior correspondent Ted Koppel examin... ""Less people are posting, it's more of a 'lean back' experience. Then again, there is still a lot of content being created with Snapchat. I mean, one of the big trends on social is Instagram copying something like Snapchat. My theory of what is happening, what Snapchat was able to do that Instagram wants to emulate, is moving to a platform for content creators who create messy and in-the-moment content that goes away and doesn't matter. It disappears, it's more ephemeral - people are looking for those fleeting moments, rather than something set in stone.""

Pineiro also highlighted the fact that live video is an interesting development for a company like Facebook that has seen its sheen of ""cool"" chip away as older consumers become more of its core audience than millennials or the younger ""Generation Z.""

""For a lot of 2016, the best brands could do was create a live video and find a way to put non-live videos into the live video format to get more views - they were using Facebook's new tools to their benefit,"" he said of brands and users looking for ways to find relevance through a social platform that is something of a dinosaur in tech years compared to the Snapchats of the world.

Another social media trend he's keeping an eye on is the rise of fake news and its impact on real-world events. Moving forward, ""Facebook has to be held accountable for the information and misinformation that it is feeding"" its audience, Pineiro said.The new tech leaders

When looking at the year ahead, Ackerman said it will be interesting to see who emerges dominant in the larger tech space.

""It's become tougher recently for one company to really be at the lead,"" Ackerman said. ""Look, it's hard for a small startup company to capture the attention that bigger companies have, but that being said, there are exciting exciting new spaces out there.""

Sometimes, one gadget on its own could be enough to seize the attention of consumers and win over skeptics - but that kind of success is rare.

Pineiro used the example of Google Glass, which debuted to huge publicity but ultimately failed to capture the consumer's imagination.

""It became kind of the slow-motion failure of a product that we all saw. Now, you see this completely different approach to something similar with Snapchat Spectacles,"" Pineiro said. ""It's marketed as a toy and not a tool, and so far, I'm very curious to see what Snapchat does. What does this mean as Snapchat for a platform moving forward? I foresee Snapchat heading into this heightened territory for AR [augmented reality] where they are downplaying the tech as a 'toy' and keeping it in that millennial state of mind. They are taking away the barriers between somebody's experiences and giving them the ability to share them.""

Does this mean social media companies like Snapchat could move from the world of apps to become consumer product leaders? Ackerman said that he has his eye on companies like Amazon and Google also following this trend - tech companies that aren't traditional gadget-makers moving into the hardware side of things.

""You know you have Amazon and Google moving into this space rapidly,"" Ackerman said. ""You have very big data-driven companies that have more information at their disposal than hardware companies and they are continuing to move into the hardware space. That's something to look out for in the new year.""

"
2431331648,"UTC

Each year, our phones, social media accounts, laptops, smart assistants, fitness trackers and other tech somehow swallow up even more of our time.

For the new year, here are a handful of resolutions that aim to improve our relationship to the technology that rules our lives:

Image: DUSTIN DRANKOSKI/MASHABLE

1. Start taking cybersecurity seriously

2016 was the year personal cybersecurity came to the forefront. In what was described as the worst hack ever, more than 500 million Yahoo email accounts were leaked.

Cybercriminals created a gigantic bot net built from insecure ""Internet of Things"" devices (like web-connected thermostats and coffee makers) that brought down major websites across the internet. Even the Democratic National Committee was compromised .

Luckily, it's easier than ever to protect yourself. The first step is to stay vigilant. Google your name and look through several pages of results to see what information about you is publicly available. It doesn't hurt to set social media accounts like Instagram and Twitter to private.

Don't get lazy with passwords. The worst thing you can do is reuse the same password for multiple sites. It's easy to use a simple tool like LastPass to keep all your passwords in one place.

The most important (and easiest) thing you can do is enable two-factor authentication. While that term might sound complicated, it's actually super simple. When you turn it on, services like Gmail and Facebook require more than your password to get into your accounts.

In most cases, once it's enabled, you simply fork over your phone number and when you log on, a site will text an access code to your device. Once the site has both your password and the access code, you're in. Using it means that even if someone gets access to your password, they can't get into your account without your phone.

You can check which sites offer two-factor authentication here .

2. Respond to texts and emails on time

Despite being glued to our phones, many of us have trouble responding to texts, emails and other messages from people we care about within a reasonable time frame. The problem then only gets worse. Instead of having one or two messages to respond to, within a week the pile of correspondence can seem unmanageable.

The easiest solution is to pick a time each day to respond to your non-work related correspondence. Although it doesn't seem like a task, treating your messages like another errand to tackle can make the process seem less daunting.

Responding later is also better than never responding at all. Even if it seems awkward to answer a text a week late, the person on the receiving end will likely be happy with a late reply rather than no reply at all.

It also helps to not set unreasonable expectations. If you're really busy, indicate to your friends and family that it might be easier to send an email or Facebook message instead of expecting regular short texts from you.

The greatest reward you'll receive from actually getting back to people on time is being free from digital guilt. No more worrying that your best friend saw that Instagram you posted when you haven't even texted her back.

3. Be more present IRL

21 percent of Americans say that they're online ""almost constantly."" And we're now spending more time with our phones than with our significant others. In 2017, cutdown on the amount of time you spend staring at screens - it could also improve your mental health.

Psychologist Dr. Deepika Chopra draws a link between screen time and negative emotions. ""Too much social media or smartphone usage may be costing you more than just time,"" she told Mashable last year.

""Studies show it may be stealing your happiness, stunting development in children, and decreasing academic and social potential in our college student population.""

To try and decrease the amount of time you dedicate to your phone, the easiest first step is to turn off notifications. That way, you're only checking your phone when you want to as opposed to every time it buzzes.

Apps like QualityTime for Android and Moment for iOS track how much time you spend staring at your screen, which can help you visualize how much of your day is dedicated to checking social media and playing games on your phone.

4. Finally update everything

This one is easy. If you don't think it's important to regularly update your software, consider that you're putting yourself at a security risk when you don't.

Oftentimes, when a company like Apple issues a software update, included are patches that cover previously undiscovered security vulnerabilities.

Updating your software is also important because if you fall too far behind, some apps will stop working because they're no longer compatible with your outdated software.

It can be a pain to update your devices, since it usually means waiting a half hour or so for them to reboot. Luckily it's possible to automatically update your software while you sleep .

You can also set your Windows or Mac computer to update automatically.

5. Delete digital clutter

I'm guilty of storing old text messages and photos from past friendships and romantic relationships on my phone because I'm afraid of losing them forever.

In reality, they're just taking up precious storage space on my iPhone and causing me to dwell on painful memories when I come across the mementos by accident.

The easiest solution is to set your text messages to automatically delete after a certain interval of time. You can also backup texts and photos on your computer, but opt out of carrying them with you everywhere on your phone.

Another good goal is to clear off your desktop, which can be cluttered with screenshots, dowloaded files and old documents. Aim to actually be able to see your desktop background.

Another place to declutter is your email inbox. Instead of deleting unwanted newsletters and advertisements, force yourself to keep them around until you actually unsubscribe.

In the future if you still want to sign up for mailing lists, it's easy to create a dummy email that you use only for that purpose.

If you're interested in staying on top of retail deals, you can use a tool like RetailMeNot instead of signing up for email blasts.

Only have a couple of minutes to make a quick fix? The quickest thing you can do to declutter your digital life is to empty your downloads folder. Clearing it will likely free up a good amount of space on your hard drive.

7. Actually use that fitness tracker you got for the holidays

Incorporating a new gadget into your life can be more difficult than you expect. If you want to actually start using a new fitness tracker, the first thing you can do is remember why you got it in the first place.

Are you primarily interested in counting steps? Monitoring your sleep? Are you trying to walk more or sleep better? Picking one goal and sticking to it can make incorporating the tracker into your life easier.

It can also help to not put pressure on yourself to check the data you're collecting on a daily or even weekly basis. As long as you're wearing the tracker consistently, it can still be useful to reflect on your health data monthly.

2431331992,"Human life, seeded to other planets by an extraterrestrial civilization, could explain why so many of the aliens in the fictional ""Star Trek"" universe resemble human men and women.

After studying scenes from the various shows and movies, one evolutionary biologist posited that the galaxy-wide distribution of Earth-based life-forms could help to explain some of the resemblance between Kirk and Spock.

""This model ignores things like the difference in heart placement - perhaps unlikely - or the Vulcan copper, rather than human iron-based, blood - also unlikely,"" Mohamed Noor, an evolutionary biologist at Duke University in North Carolina, told Space.com by email. ""But the overall principle is more probable than the notion that the species evolved completely independently to look almost the same after billions of years."" Noor presented the results of his off-hour research this summer at Atlanta's Dragon Con. [How 'Star Trek' Technology Works (Infographic)] Life on Earth might not have originated on the planet itself. Scientists have long considered the possibility of panspermia, the idea that our planet's life or its precursors came from outer space. After drifting, unplanned, into the habitable environment, the seed material might have developed into life as we know it today.

A similar idea was investigated in an episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" In ""The Chase"" (Season 6, Episode 20), an ancient alien species called the Preservers was revealed to have seeded many planets with the same genetic material. Over billions of years, similar plants, animals and humanoids developed on a variety of worlds, according to the story presented in the episode.

But Noor doesn't buy it. ""Sounds good, but no way,"" Noor said. Even with the same initial conditions, he said, the probability of plants and animals with similar appearances - and, in species like Vulcans, able to breed with humans - developing on multiple worlds from only genetic material is incredibly low. With the passage of so much time, the various worlds would evolve creatures very different from one another.

""By their [the show's] model, we are literally more closely related to grass or an amoeba than we are to a Vulcan,"" Noor said. ""I don't imagine us having kids with those other species."" [] Instead, Noor proposed that the seeding occurred much more recently than portrayed in the episode. If the human ancestor Homo erectus, along with plants and other animals, were taken by the Preservers only a million years ago, rather than the proposed billion, and were seeded onto planets like Vulcan, the resulting life-forms could be more closely related, Noor said.

""It would require an extreme version of fast terraforming, but from a biological perspective, it's at least possible,"" Noor said.

Meanwhile, the Homo erectus individuals who remained on Earth could have evolved into humans while those on Vulcan evolved to become pointy-eared aliens.

""The two modern species would surely look similar, but it's likely there would be some physical differences,"" Noor said, pointing to Vulcans' unusual ears and eyebrows. The close genetic relationship among the different descendants of Homo erectus could even allow them to produce an offspring born of both, such as the half-human, half-Vulcan Spock.

As a longtime ""Star Trek"" fan, Noor has enjoyed examining the accuracy of the show. In college, he and his professors would joke about the unfeasible scientific explanations presented in ""The Next Generation,"" the series on the air at the time. To prepare for his Dragon Con presentation, Noor spent time reviewing various episodes from multiple series of the show, and then discussing the science with biologists and chemists.

""I think the idea of trying to imagine what life in outer space could be is fascinating,"" he said. ""I have really enjoyed researching this.""

If human life in the ""Star Trek"" universe was indeed seeded on multiple planets, Earth would be the most likely original source, Noor said. That's because life-forms on Earth are clearly related to one another in a hierarchal way. Humans would be more closely related to aliens such as Romulans and Klingons than they are to chimpanzees.

Confirming this would be ""remarkably easy"" for an evolutionary biologist in the ""Star Trek"" universe, Noor said. By comparing DNA samples from other human-like aliens to those of Earthlings, biologists would be able to discover the close genetic relationship between them, which would easily rule out the idea of random, undirected panspermia.

""We may even be able to infer approximately how many years ago this happened from the difference in the DNA sequence,"" Noor said.

It was at the end of September and USC was in a bad way. Sports Illustrated and others in the college football pundit class were speculating that Tom Herman, then the coach at Houston, could become the next coach of the Trojans - after Helton was fired.

USC was 1-2, about to be 1-3, with two players under investigation for sexual assault.

At one point, Helton was forced to address a false but widely circulating rumor that a transferring player had punched him.

Penn State , meanwhile, wasn't doing much better. A few days after Helton spoke about the punch that wasn't, James Franklin's Penn State squad lost to Michigan, 49-10.

That dropped the Nittany Lions ' record to 2-2, and the next week the home fans booed and chanted ""Fire Franklin!"" (Herman, again, was among the speculated replacements.)

And then, suddenly, neither team could lose.

Helton and Franklin have gone from the coaches' hot seat to the sidelines in the Rose Bowl on Monday. Their resurgence has become evidence for an argument for a modicum of patience in a sport where that is often at a premium.

""They both went through the dark just to find the light,"" USC receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said.

The coaches say they understand losing will always put their jobs in jeopardy. Franklin earns $4.5 million a year, plus bonuses, according to USA Today's college football salary database. Helton's salary has not been disclosed. His predecessor, Steve Sarkisian, made $3.6 million per season.

""If you're 1-3 at USC, you deserve to get talked about, that's just a fact,"" Helton told Times columnist Bill Plaschke earlier this month. ""If you can't handle it, don't take the job. This is a thick-skinned business.""

Franklin said that at a program like Penn State, ""If you're not playing for conference and national championships, people get uneasy. We understand that; we embrace it.""

But he also said decision-makers should consider a broader view for what defines a successful coach.

""Our profession has gotten a little bit out of whack and gotten a little bit crazy,"" Franklin said. He said a coach's responsibilities include developing and graduating his players.

""I think if it was just about the winning and the losing, we'd go coach in the NFL,"" he said.

But it was winning that got both off the hot seat. Players on each team say their coach's steadiness kept the season from sinking. Faced with chaos, they responded with stability.

Franklin and Helton each worked from the bottom ranks of coaching. Franklin, a Division II quarterback at East Stroudsburg in Pennsylvania, became a graduate assistant there but wasn't earning enough to afford rent. He slept on the head coach's couch.

Helton, a backup quarterback at Houston, got his start as a graduate assistant at Duke, earning $832 a month.

Brent Pry, Penn State's defensive coordinator, crossed paths with Helton when both were assistants at Memphis. Pry noticed that Helton's demeanor never seemed to change. By the way he behaved, it was difficult to tell if Helton was coming off a big win or a blowout loss.

Pry says he sees a lot of Helton in Franklin.

""This year was a good earmark for just level-headedness, not jumping the gun,"" Pry said. ""Clay and James are those kind of guys.""

The panic point for both arrived after Week 4. USC had just collapsed against Utah for its third loss. After the game, Helton responded with uncommon optimism.

""That was the most fun I've had in a long time,"" he said minutes after the game.

The comment rubbed some people the wrong way, but Helton's attitude was calculated. He said later that players need stability. Helton did not want to cause alarm.

""At Utah, all he told us was that he loved us and that if we stick together, we're going to win ballgames,"" defensive tackle Stevie Tu'ikolovatu said. ""Then ever since that, that's exactly what happened.""

The same week, injury-ravaged Penn State was destroyed by Michigan.

""We came back the next day and Coach Franklin told us we're not that far off, we're right there,"" tight end Mike Gesicki said.

Players said Franklin changed nothing besides some tweaks to the game plan. The difference, linebacker Jason Cabinda said, ""was his belief in us. Belief is a powerful thing.""

The coaches gave their players space to solve their own problems. After the Utah game, USC called a players-only meeting, where some players were called out for behaving selfishly.

""Clay and James are players' coaches,"" Pry said. ""These guys are going to want to play for them, they believe them. Tough times, that's where it's at, the relationships.""

Each also had the luxury of knowing help was on the way. For USC, quarterback Sam Darnold, in his first start against Utah, had showed the ability to be among the nation's best quarterbacks. And Penn State's defensive woes could be partially attributed to a linebacking unit decimated by early injuries.

The teams have combined to go 17-0 since then. Penn State's nine-game winning streak is third-longest in the nation. USC's streak of eight games ranks fourth.

Players on each team said they heard the calls for their coach's job. That, they said, has made the Rose Bowl a little sweeter.

""It's funny,"" Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley said. ""The same people that were doing that are now patting us all on the back, telling us congratulations. It's funny how that all works.""

2431363972,"There was nothing groundbreaking about this year's connected timepieces. When the first smartwatches made it to our wrists a few years ago, we were willing to overlook shortcomings because the product category was in its infancy. But the technology has had time to mature, and 2016 should have been an exciting year in this space. Instead, we saw a number of important brands pull out of the smartwatch race; meanwhile Google deferred major updates to 2017. Smaller but significant companies were swallowed by competitors, and the devices that did launch this year were unexciting at best. Smartwatch sales , and while the all-important holiday shopping numbers haven't been tallied yet, the future isn't looking good for the category. This year's new watches, such as the Apple Watch Series 2, the Fitbit Blaze and a slew of Android Wear watches, were mostly underwhelming, with merely incremental upgrades. Battery life continues to be unsatisfactory, the cases are usually still too thick, and companies still struggle to balance timeless design with futuristic functionality. Google, which originally planned to launch Android Wear 2.0 this year, is pushing that update to early 2017. The new version will apparently allow for apps that can run independently on smartwatches without requiring a companion phone, something that Apple's watchOS 2 has offered since fall 2015. Speaking of Apple, the Series 2 appears to be one of the few smartwatches that did well this year: It's received mostly positive reviews and appears to be selling decently well, although Apple did not respond to queries on actual sales numbers.

Traditional watchmakers continued to smarten up their products this year, with one of the most notable being Tag Heuer and its fancy Connected watch. That thing costs a whopping $1,500, and it doesn't offer much more than the other Android Wear watches. Sure, it's a Tag, but when most Android Wear watches cost between $150 and $400, you realize that you're paying $1,200 more for yet another wearable that needs recharging every two days or so, with a display that's middling at best.

The only established watchmakers that succeeded at producing decent devices (think Timex and Fossil) did so by avoiding going fully digital, sticking instead to more-conventional analog designs with hidden sensors for basic fitness tracking. Really, then, the watches that did well this year were the hybrids, with the one big exception being the Apple Watch Series 2.

Then come the brands that have basically given up on making smartwatches altogether. A Motorola exec recently said to last year's Moto 360, because it just doesn't ""see enough pull in the market"" to justify developing an updated model. That this kind of sentiment is coming from Motorola, of all companies, is telling. After all, the Moto 360 was the first Android Wear watch to have a round face and is one of the most well-received smartwatches running Google's software.

Similarly, this year Microsoft discontinued its Band fitness wearable. Although it's more of an activity tracker, the Microsoft Band always toed the line, what with its color touchscreen and smartwatch-like features such as phone notifications and third-party app support. Unlike Motorola, however, Microsoft never explained its exit from the field, although it continues to support its suite of health apps that can run on other devices.

One of the biggest signs that smartwatches are in trouble, though, was for the modest sum of about $40 million. Back in its heyday, Pebble reportedly received bids from Citizen and Intel for $740 million and $70 million, respectively. The startup declined both suitors and went on to launch a new line of fitness-focused smartwatches this year. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 raised $12 million on Kickstarter, beating the $1 million funding goal. Despite the company's fundraising successes, Pebble failed to resolve its financial woes and eventually accepted Fitbit's offer.

With so much consolidation in the smartwatch space, the future of the category looks gloomy. Less competition can mean less innovation, which can result in products growing stale and eventually fading altogether. Still, there have been developments in 2016 that could give the industry a boost. Startup Matrix Industries came up with a way to , which could eliminate (or at least alleviate) the problem of inadequate battery life. Plus, with Android Wear 2.0 slated to arrive early next year, the next generation of smartwatches will likely become more functional, giving users more reason to wear them.

We also saw a few watches this year that let wearers control Amazon's Alexa from their wrist, although they ran obscure independent operating systems that barely had third-party app support. The Alexa integration means that these watches can access more than 2,000 so-called skills, letting you do things such as turn on your smart lights or thermostat, ask how much you've spent at specific stores, or buy many, many pairs of socks. You can't do most of that yet with Android Wear's OK Google command, but Alexa's expansion into watches could spur Google to improve its own assistant.

So 2016 wasn't a great year for smartwatches. In fact, it was a disappointing 12 months that don't bode well for the future of the category. But there are enough upcoming potential enhancements that the industry could be revived. Components could also get smaller and more powerful over time, as they did with smartphones, eventually leading to sleeker frames housing more full-featured systems. But that's something to look forward to in the future. As for this year's smartwatches? Goodbye, and good riddance.

2431369198,"President-elect Donald Trump will say goodbye to 2016 alongside 800 paying guests at his Mar-a-Lago estate Saturday, surrounded by an explosion of white and green flowers in his massive ballroom.

The annual Mar-a-Lago New Year's Eve, which wife Melania and son Barron will also attend, is a highlight on the private club's social calendar, members say. One indicated that prices range from $525 for members to $575 for members' guests - in line with ticket prices in past years.

The event is sold out, according to Trump's incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. He said the bash would begin with cocktails in the mansion's living room, following by dinner and dancing in the Grand Ballroom.

Trump himself added the ballroom onto Mar-a-Lago after purchasing the estate in 1985. The ornate space holds numerous annual fundraisers during the Palm Beach social season.

Transition officials have downplayed the suggestion that purchasing tickets to Saturday's event may be akin to buying access to the President-elect, noting the New Year's Eve party is an annual event at the club that regularly sells out.

For Saturday's event, florists and designers concocted a ""sophisticated and elegant"" scheme that incorporates 8,000 flowers on tables and overhead.

""A lot of crystal, a lot of gold, a lot of candles,"" Steve Levine, the business manager for Jose Gratrol Designs, said of the party's decor. He said the Miami-based decoration company was planning a ""special treatment with white flower garlands over the dance floor.""

He said his company submits its plans to Mar-a-Lago's director of catering, who then presents them to Melania and Donald Trump for approval.

The same firm provided decoration for the past two New Years Eve parties at the estate, and Levine said this year's decoration is along the same lines, though specified they never repeat any decoration identically.

The band for the evening: Party on the Moon, whose website hails the group as ""America's #1 Corporate and Private Party Band."" In a posting on the website, bandleader Dennis Smith said Party on the Moon had performed at an inaugural ball for President Barack Obama and would be honored to do the same for Trump.

""If I get the call to perform for President-Elect Trump, we will be there. If Hillary Clinton gave us the call, we would be there,"" Smith wrote. ""My life as an artist has nothing to do with my political choices.""

In past years, celebrities like Vanessa Williams, Regis Philbin and Rod Stewart have attended the party, according to the Palm Beach Post. At Mar-a-Lago Friday, Italian-American model Fabio was spotted entering the club.

Spicer said Friday that notable guests attending this year included Sylvester Stallone and Quincy Jones. However, Jones tweeted that he would be in Los Angeles for the holiday: ""Looking forward to spending New Year's Eve & the whole weekend w/my kids, & friends in LA. Be safe yawl & have a Happy New Year.""

Mar-a-Lago, a sprawling Italianate estate with fountains, pools and a croquet lawn, was originally intended by its builder to serve as a ""Winter White House,"" though it has never acted in that capacity until now.

Trump has relished the grandiosity of the estate, summoning potential Cabinet picks for meetings there at the same time regular members shuffle through the stately living and dining rooms.

The club has maintained its schedule of events, including annual holiday dinners. At Trump's place setting on Christmas Eve: a nameplate reading ""Mr. President.""

2431407912,"Treating diseases that have a genetic component by altering the expression of the responsible genes is a promising new field of medicine, but it has been much less straightforward than biopharmaceutical companies had expected. Two contenders in this area, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ:ALNY ) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ:IONS ) , saw a mix of setbacks and success in 2016.

Image source: .

In 2016, these two stocks have taken paths as varied as their approaches to drug development, and the past few months have been a wild ride. Since the beginning of October, shares of Alnylam have dropped more than 40%, while Ionis has gained 35%. In light of the recent market-moving events, investors are right to wonder which stock is the better pick at recent prices. Let's compare the two to see how they stack up at the moment.

Arguments for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals

The bull thesis for Alnylam took a major hit in October when the company shuttered its revusiran program due to safety issues. The candidate was intended to alleviate heart damage caused by buildup of a misfolded protein called transthyretin. If the halted late-stage trial had led to approval, then revusiran might have eventually generated roughly $1 billion in annual sales at its peak.

Alnylam's second drug in late-stage development is also aimed at transthyretin amyloidosis, but patisiran is intended to reduce nerve damage caused by its buildup. This is a far less common symptom than heart damage, and peak annual sales estimates for the drug candidate top out around $700 million. Luckily, a recent safety analysis suggests patisiran isn't causing the same side effects that doomed revusiran.

It's also fortunate that Alnylam has two more candidates ready to enter phase 3 trials in 2017 that sport an arguably safer delivery technology than revusiran. Givosiran is a candidate for treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias, a series of enzymatic disorders that affect an estimated 5,000 patients throughout the U.S. and Europe who lack effective preventative treatment options. Fitusiran is a unique hemophilia candidate aimed at lowering antithrombin activity, rather than replacing factors associated with the bleeding disorder. If successful, it could find a small niche among roughly 6,000 hemophilia patients worldwide who have developed inhibitors to current factor-replacement therapies.

Arguments for Ionis Pharmaceuticals

While Alnylam's RNA interference approach is far different from Ionis' antisense approach, it also has a transthyretin-related program with ongoing safety issues. In May, Ionis stock was pummeled after its partner, GlaxoSmithKline , announced it would delay advancing IONIS-TTRrx into a phase 3 heart damage study in light of dangerously low platelet levels associated with its use.

Unlike Alnylam, Ionis and Glaxo are developing the same candidate for treatment of transthyretin-related nerve damage. If its safety profile holds up through a phase 3 trial in this group, its big pharma partner might allow the delayed study to continue.

Also in stark contrast to Alnylam, Ionis has earned FDA approval for two drugs already. Kynamro -- for treatment of a rare, inherited form of super-high cholesterol -- flopped in the face of competing drugs. Luckily, its second drug to earn the green light has a much better chance in the commercial stage. Its collaboration partner Biogen will launch recently approved Spinraza unopposed as the first treatment for the most common genetic cause of infant mortality in America, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The disease is most severe when it affects newborns, but a much larger population doesn't begin showing symptoms until later in life. A single approval for all SMA patients could allow the drug to reach peak annual sales of around $2 billion sooner than expected, and Ionis will receive a tiered royalty percentage up to the mid-teens.

In the meantime, the approval triggers a $60 million milestone payment from Biogen, which will help fund development of a candidate that Ionis owns outright. Volanesorsen recently smashed through its main goal in a phase 3 trial with severe hypertriglyceridemia patients, which suggests it has a clear shot at becoming the first effective therapy for two rare metabolic disorders.

The better buy

Investing in the pioneer of RNA interference today seems like a risky proposition. It will be at least a year before we know whether Alnylam has a chance of launching patisiran, at which time it may have to compete with IONIS-TTRrx for share of an already small space.

Image source: .

Ionis Pharmaceuticals stock is hardly risk-free. Its valuation suggests success well beyond Spinraza, which is still far from certain. Its entire lineup is based on RNA antisense technology that still lacks enough real-world data to boast a squeaky-clean safety profile.

We'll know more within a couple of years as the Spinraza launch unfolds, which is a lot more than we can say for Alnylam at the moment. Despite its higher valuation, a much clearer path to profitability makes Ionis Pharmaceuticals the better stock pick right now.

2431431525,"Kelli Barrett compiled this retrospective for Ecosystem Marketplace.

Market research firms are reporting strong holiday-season sales for 2016 , numbers not seen since the mid-2000s, as lower gas and food prices, a rising stock market and higher wages propelled shoppers into stores and onto retail websites. And while consumerism typically has a negative effect on the world's forests - everything, it seems, comes from the rainforest - it isn't necessarily true this year, or at least there is reason to be optimistic.

Earlier this month, Ecosystem Marketplace scouted the holiday shopping landscape for its eco-friendliness discovering some promising gift ideas - Gucci's retro handbag is made with deforestation-free leather - and finding supply change disclosure and transparency efforts from CDP, Canopy and Forest Trends' Supply Change project make it markedly easier to determine a product's environmental impact, though it's still difficult.

Mark Trexler, the longtime expert on environmental policy who now runs the Climatographers , wrote this year that the private sector is massive and diverse and sees the climate problem in different ways . However, investors and the business community as a whole are increasingly becoming more involved in climate action that involves sustainable supply chains and forests, a global movement that began in earnest in 2014 with the New York Declaration on Forests .

Supply Change, tracking corporate commitments through publicly disclosed data on the ""Big Four"" forest-risk commodities: palm oil, cattle, soy and wood, identified a rise in corporate commitments to end deforestation this year. The report, Tracking Corporate Commitments to Deforestation-free Supply Chains, 2016 , tracked pledges up from 307 commitments and 243 commitments in March of 2015 to 579 pledges and 366 companies.

And since nations signed the Paris Climate Agreement on Earth Day 2016 , 41 corporates joined the Science Based Targets initiative setting rigorous climate targets that align with the Paris Agreement. In total, over 150 businesses have joined.

But while companies are making progress on greening their supply chains, all is far from well. It's an incredibly difficult process and companies quickly learned in 2016 that setting a deforestation or sustainability commitment is far different than achieving it . The cattle sector, for instance, is particularly difficult to track because of their mobility .

Many companies are turning to certification programs at least to get started as 77% of commitments tracked by Supply Change rely in some way on third-party commodity certifications such as the Forest Stewardship Council or the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil. The Forest Trust, however, is one organization interested in helping companies turn their commitments into action in ways that don't involve certification programs .

""Supply chains are vast, complicated intricate things with a lot of moving parts and players,"" said Kevin Rabinovitch, the Global Director of Sustainability for candy and food giant Mars. "" They are more like webs than chains. ""

Only half of the companies that pledged to source certified soy have yet to integrate it into their supply chains, although 74% of the companies that committed to sustainable palm oil have done so, according to a CDP report released in March.

NGOs such as Climate Focus say companies need more help, and during the November climate talks, the Global Canopy Programme and Stockholm Environment Institute launched a platform called Trase , (Transparency for Sustainable Economies), which makes it possible to track soybeans from specific municipalities in Brazil, through traders, to end countries .

""A major blocker toward the zero deforestation economy is supply chain complexity and supply chain opacity,"" Niki Mardas, the Executive Director of Global Canopy Programme, said. ""There's an urgent need for a breakthrough in transparency and to move toward a more radical transparency.""

Such supply chain transparency will not only benefit businesses but also the watchdogs tracking companies' progress on commitments they have set . During the climate talks, Climate Focus released a progress report on the NYDF , which focused on the second of its 10 goals: ""Support and help meet the private-sector goal of eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities."" The assessment couldn't produce results on parts of the goal because there is currently no available data to determine whether corporate commitments to reduce deforestation are translating into real reductions.

2016's Commitment Conundrums

Companies continued to establish targets this year and last to improve sourcing of commodities driving deforestation, many of them setting their target date at 2020, the same year other companies who started working toward that goal much earlier. The corporate newcomers are aiming to achieve in a shortened timeline what the early movers are taking a decade to do.

""This raises a lot of questions,"" says Supply Change Senior Associate Ben McCarthy. ""Are they biting off more than they can chew? Are they cutting corners to meet their goals? Or does the second-mover advantage mean they'll actually pull it off?""

In September, Ecosystem Marketplace explored the action required for companies to achieve their targets .

Disclosure is another issue. There is a high-progress/low disclosure paradox found in the company profiles Supply Change tracks . Of the commitments that have progress information publicly available, the average achievement rate is 72%. However, only 48% of the commitments are disclosing progress information.

Do companies only disclose progress when it is good news? How can companies be held accountable for these commitments? And, since the progress information is almost always self-reported, can the numbers be trusted?

We can expect to see these questions often throughout the coming year.

Regional Progress on Deforestation

Brazil's Soy Moratorium has been a successful tool in lowering deforestation attributed to soy in the Amazon, and in May, industry associations administering the moratorium decided to renew it .

""The soy industry in Brazil is now leading the world in terms of private-sector leadership,"" said Holly Gibbs, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who has extensively researched the moratorium. ""They're sending a strong signal to the palm sector, to the cattle sector, and to other places in the world - like Argentina's Gran Chaco region, where soy expansion continues to lead the conversion of forests to farms.""

Also in Brazil, municipalities launched efforts to lower their high rates of deforestation, and in February, Ecosystem Marketplace explored the birth of the country's first ""Green Municipality ,"" sprawling Paragominas in the state of Pará. The efforts could pay off as consumer giants such as Unilever and Marks & Spencer have made announcements to source raw materials from environmentally conscious regions .

Paragominas' efforts have yielded mixed results and significant insights into what it takes to slow deforestation in the Amazon .

Meanwhile, Kenyan dairy farmers are leveraging trees to boost their milk yields through an agroforestry project . They're receiving funds from food companies Danone and Mars, both of which are interested in using sustainable agriculture to build sustainable supply chains.

Food and Forests

Sustainable agriculture is critical to solving the climate challenge as food production is a major driver of global warming , contributing about a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and stands to be among the sectors most affected by climate disruptions.

Speaking of food, America's love affair with the avocado came to a head in 2016 as revelations revealed farmers are chopping forests in central Mexico in order to grow more of the famously healthy commodity. Ecosystem Marketplace explored the problem in detail in August as well as solutions, which aren't coming in a neat tidy box .

It can be a vicious cycle as regions clear forests to grow more food but deforestation disrupts ecosystem services and often undermines food security as well as energy and water. In September, the Global Canopy Programme published a policy brief suggesting policymakers of the Amazon follow the integrated approaches of the water-energy-food nexus so as to promote policies that preserve forests and the service they provide.

Marrakesh Musings

The international climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco helped close out the year with the private sector expected to play an important role in the talks . Last year's Paris Climate Agreement enshrined forests as a key climate mitigation tool, and cleansing the ""Big Four"" from corporate supply chains is integral to saving forests.

The talks were somewhat overshadowed by the surprising results of the United States presidential election on November 8. Donald Trump was elected president raising questions as to the US' role in future international climate negotiations and action at home.

""We cannot pretend that last night's election outcome was anything less than deeply disturbing to those of us who care about climate stability and the role of the United States in the world,"" said Nathaniel Keohane, Vice President for Global Climate at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Mr. Trump should listen to the large majority of Americans who support climate action, and to the overwhelming majority of climate scientists who warn that the time for action is now.""

Regional governments, businesses and investors pledged almost immediately after the election that they would carry on efforts to decarbonize and align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

Indeed, 365 US businesses and investors reaffirmed their support for the Paris Climate Agreement via a letter addressed to US President Barack Obama, President-Elect Donald Trump, Congress and other global leaders and calling on them to continue their support for the Paris Agreement and for low-carbon development .

""It is not going to be governments alone, or even principally, that solve the climate challenge,"" said US Secretary of State John Kerry during a speech in Marrakesh. ""The private sector is the most important player.""

Talking nearly one week after the election of Trump, pension fund managers like Pete Grannis of New York state and Gerald Cartigny of Dutch fund manager MN said they have no plans to re-load their portfolios with high-carbon fossil fuels - because the numbers don't make sense .

Perils and Possibilities of Supply Chain Change

The supply change space experienced a wide range of ups and downs in 2016. It closed out the year with two reports, one CDP published and the other from the Global Canopy Programme (GCP).

CDP's report, written at the behest of 365 institutional investors, revealed that disruptions in supplies of forest risk commodities could cost USD 906 billion per year.

GCP's report delivered pressing news as well. Of the entities listed on its Forest 500, which names and shames the 500 entities that can end deforestation, 57% either have no policies to end deforestation in place or none GCP deems credible.

While both reports were on the doom and gloom side, it's possible that greater awareness among companies on the benefits of sustainable sourcing, coupled with investor interest in sustainability, could propel them to act.

2431436065,"Gospel singer Kim Burrell, who has been helping Pharrell promote the ""Hidden Figures"" soundtrack, is facing intense criticism following the release of a video in which she calls gay people ""perverted"" and says they have ""embarrassed"" God during a sermon at a church.

In the video, which was uploaded to YouTube on Friday, Burrell, a pastor at the Love & Liberty Fellowship Church in Houston, is seen issuing an unambiguously homophobic rant to the audience. ""I came to tell you about sin,"" Burrell says.

""That perverted homosexual spirit, and the spirit of delusion and confusion, it has deceived many men and women. You as a man, you open your mouth and take a man's penis in your face ― you are perverted,"" Burrell continues. ""You are a woman and will shake your face in another woman's breast, you are perverted.""

She then adds, ""It has come into our church and it has embarrassed the kingdom of God.""

Burrell soon starting trending on Twitter after the video was uploaded, with many quick to note that she has worked with bisexual R&B singer Frank Ocean in the past, and is scheduled to appear on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" with Pharrell on Thursday . Pharrell and Burrell have been working the media circuit to promote the ""Hidden Figures"" soundtrack, which features their duet ""I See a Victory.""

Kim Burrell: Homosexuals are perverted!!

Frank: Come get this check for singing on my album.

Burrell addressed the video on Facebook Live early Saturday morning, but did not apologize for her remarks, instead saying that her intentions had been misconstrued and her words twisted.

""I never said that all gays were going to hell ... I said people who operate with that spirit in the church with deception and attack themselves are going to have to face the master,"" she said. Near the end, she lashed out at her fans, blaming them for her lack of record sales and Grammys.

The Facebook video has not been enough to quell the anger online, as Burrell has continued to be criticized by artists and activists alike, most notably DeRay Mckesson of the Black Lives Matter movement.

2431490129,"SUGHED: Remote-controlled group holds final race of 2016

BY BERENICE GARCIA | STAFF WRITER

MISSION - As many people prepared for their New Year's Eve festivities, one group spent the last day of the year racing remote-controlled cars.

Racing aficionados got together at Bentsen Palm Community Park for the last race of the year organized by BARC, a nonprofit organization in Mission.

The purpose of the organization is to provide a haven for people who want to race or practice, according to Brandon Mahan, the founder of the organization.

""To preserve what was here as far as the racing community,"" he said.

Mahan said the remote-controlled car racing scene has been present in the Valley for at least 15 years. It was mainly based out of Harlingen until the track there shut down last year, so Mahan decided to build another in Mission.

""We just kind of approached the city here about doing a pioneer project and checking it out and seeing what they wanted to let us do,"" he said. ""They were really nice and we got to throw some dirt in hills and make a track out of it.""

They had their inaugural race in September where they collected canned food for the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley.

First-time racer Ethan Falcon, 26, brought his cousin-in-law Ronnie Ramirez, 10, to simply be spectators until Mahan convinced him to join the race.

Falcon said he brought Ramirez, whom he sees as a little brother, into the RC racing fold.

""I've been slowly introducing him to RC Cars,"" Falcon said. ""I wanted to kinda use it as a way to mentor him and stuff so he doesn't get into bad habits.""

They've worked together on the cars for about three years, which can require a lot of dedication.

""Once you get the car, it requires a lot of tuning and upgrades to get it to where it's race ready,"" Falcon said.

One of their cars, he said, was only about 80 percent complete. ""I'm about 50/50 right now if it's going to survive the race.""

The car he obtained free-of-charge from a friend, though he estimates he's invested about $300 in it since then.

Upgrades and maintenance can reach the thousands.

Carlos Franklin, 28, said he invested at least $1,300 into one of his cars.

""It just relaxing to run around, not doing any harm, just having fun,"" he said. ""Expensive fun.""

He used to travel and compete around the state but has slowed down as he prepares to get married.

Franklin said he got into RC racing because of his father and said he will probably introduce his future children to racing some day.

With Semyon Varlamov injured and Colorado temporarily playing three goaltenders, the picture is a bit tweaked. But Colorado has about $52 million in cap hits committed for next season, with the following from the current active roster potentially coming off the books:

Unrestricted free agents - Jarome Iginla ($5.3 million cap hit this season), Fedor Tyutin ($2M), John Mitchell ($1.8M), Rene Bourque ($650,000), Andreas Martinsen ($640,000), Cody Goloubef ($750,000) and Jeremy Smith ($675,000).

Restricted free agents - Eric Gelinas ($1.575M), Mikhail Grigorenko ($1.3M), Nikita Zadorov ($894,167) and Patrick Wiercioch ($800,000).

Among the potential RFAs, at least Zadorov likely would get a qualifying offer and a significant raise over his entry-level deal.

Also, the buyout of Brad Stuart, on the books at $3.6 million this season, will be completed.

Other buyouts are possible.

Varly Update. Varlamov (groin muscle issues) was unavailable for the fourth consecutive game Saturday against the Rangers, and Avalanche coach Jared Bednar before the game said Varlamov wouldn't make the upcoming trip for games at Vancouver on Monday and Calgary on Wednesday. The Avalanche didn't have a morning skate, but Varlamov went on the ice on his own for some work.

""He's going to stay back and get ready to keep advancing his rehab,"" Bednar said.

Calvin Pickard again got the start in net for Colorado, with the recalled Jeremy Smith backing him up. Smith has been the backup at San Antonio behind Spencer Martin, and Bednar said the staff at least would talk about the possibility of again recalling Martin for the trip and returning Smith to the Rampage. ""It's certainly something we're considering,"" Bednar said.

Martin has suited up for Colorado as Pickard's backup in five games, Smith for three games, when Varlamov has been injured. But going into the meeting with the Rangers, neither Martin nor Smith had gotten in a game.

Scratched . The Avalanche healthy scratches against the Rangers were Goloubef and Joe Colborne.

Duchene at wing. Matt Duchene recently has made no secret that he prefers to play his natural position, center, instead of right wing. After skating on the wing for significant stretches early this season, he returned to center on Dec. 11 against Toronto. But when the New Year's Eve game started Saturday, he was back at wing - this time at left wing, on a Carl Soderberg-centered line with Jarome Iginla at right wing.

""I like him at center, too,"" Bednar said after Duchene was at wing at practice Friday. ""Just on certain nights, when he have a couple of guys going, we're trying to get some of the guys going together, especially when we're playing catch-up hockey. I've liked him at center, I've liked him on the wing. I think he's probably equally as good at both. He's certainly real good on the draws.""

Bednar said that Thursday against Calgary ""we were using him again on the left side in D-zone draws. He won two or three in a row and we got some clears and so we were able to use him again. He brings some value there as well and obviously he's one of the top draw guys in the league, so we'd like to see him at least taking draws, whether he's playing center or not.""

2431539580,"Marc Gasol(Photo: Sergio Estrada, USA TODAY Sports)

In NBA A to Z Diaries, insiders and Jeff Zillgitt will provide insight, analysis and revelations from around the league in a free-flowing attempt to make sense of this 2016-17 season. The latest looks at Marc Gasol's ankle injury and how it may slow the Memphis Grizzlies big man's tremendous season.

SACRAMENTO - If Marc Gasol knows what's good for him, he'll spend the next few days with his ailing left ankle in the sands of Manhattan Beach and his mind in the California clouds.

The Memphis Grizzlies have been through enough this season as it is, what with point guard Mike Conley breaking his back and all while free agent addition Chandler Parsons continues to work his way back from knee problems. So the notion of losing their beloved big man after he turned his left ankle in a win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday is simply not acceptable.

Especially considering how good he has been this season.

MORE NBA:

For anyone sleeping on Gasol's season amid this flurry of triple-doubles from the Russell Westbrooks and James Hardens of the NBA world, take a brief moment to appreciate what the 31-year-old center has done. Not only is he on a career-high pace in scoring (20.1 points per game) and assists (4.2), but the former Defensive Player of the Year is anchoring a defense that - yet again - is as good as they come.

The Grizzlies, who had a top 10 defense for five consecutive seasons before falling to 19th during an injury-ravaged 2015-16 campaign, are currently the top ranked defensive unit in the league (100.5) under first-year coach David Fizdale. They have now gone a league-high 177 games without allowing a triple-double - as good a sign as any that they're simply more dominant than the rest on the defensive end.

As Gasol reminded me in a brief chat on Saturday night, that's the stuff he cares about. Not the other nonsense about how he's having arguably his best individual season a pro.

""I never really care about numbers,"" Gasol, who is day-to-day and has time to rest before a Tuesday game against the Los Angeles Lakers, told USA TODAY Sports. ""To me, numbers, they're just not important. Numbers is something easy. It's how can you get the team to win and the result, you'll get the numbers. If you shoot the ball enough times, you're going to get numbers. To me, numbers is an easy way to explain something. It's just a part of it.""

Still, it's quite clear that Fizdale has helped Gasol take his offense to a new level by extending his range.

Gasol had never taken more than 17 three-pointers in an entire season before this 2016-17 campaign, yet here he sits with a total of 117 attempts and 49 makes for a 41.9% mark that, by the way, is better than that of back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors (currently 40.3%). It is part of Fizdale's plan to spread the floor and open up the offense, one that still needs plenty of work (Memphis is 23rd in offensive rating).

""Now, obviously when (the three-pointer) goes in, you feel more comfortable with it and you trust it more,"" Gasol said. ""You see it working. ... You see other teams hesitant about what to do (defensively). ... It's working, and I like it because - more than anything - it creates space for the other guys.""

When healthy, Gasol and these Grizzlies are fully capable of serving up a few surprises in this coming postseason. They're currently 22-14, with home court advantage for a first-round match-up well within reach considering how quickly the Los Angeles Clippers are falling. Conley is back, and Parsons is slowly attempting to find his way while playing on a minutes restriction (and sitting on the back end of back-to-back sets). Gasol, as always, is the man in the middle who makes it all work.

2431545042,"A little over an hour before the ball dropped in New York on Saturday night, the hockey team that plays its home games a few (short Manhattan) blocks to the south of Times Square finished off its business against the Avalanche in the Pepsi Center.

Center Chris Kreider had three goals as the Rangers beat Colorado 6-2, and the quirky thing about it was that none of the many New York fans in the crowd tossed hats on the ice after his third. Perhaps it was because they were thinking that the scoring on at least one of the Kreider goals ultimately would be changed; or maybe were too depressed because of the closing of the Carnegie Deli.

Winger J.T. Miller added two goals for the Rangers, who broke out of a 2-2 tie midway through the second period and went on to what is becoming the familiar road team's rout of the Avalanche in Denver. It's almost as if the story now can come from a template; just fill in the blanks.

With Semyon Varlamov still unavailable because of groin muscle issues, Calvin Pickard got his fourth consecutive start in the Colorado net and allowed the six goals on 37 shots. Cody McLeod and Blake Comeau had the Colorado goals.

The loss was the Avalanche's third in a row and extended its home-ice winless streak to 10 games (0-9-1). Colorado, now a horrific 4-13-1 at home, hasn't won at the Pepsi Center since beating the Los Angeles Kings 4-1 on Nov. 15. The Rangers (26-12-1) won their third in a row and got their league-high 13th road win.

The Avalanche's fourth line was on for the McLeod goal that put Colorado up 1-0 only 1:59 into the first period. Mikhail Grigorenko won a faceoff and got the puck back to Tyson Barrie at the point. McLeod deflected the shot and Andreas Martinsen also screened Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist. The goal was the first of the season for McLeod, often a healthy scratch of late and also the longest-tenured member of the Avalanche.

It was 1-1 at 6:09, though, after the Rangers' Derek Stepan centered the puck from near the boards and it, at least according to the scoring that credited the goal to Kreider and the explanation of an NHL video review, went off both Kreider and then Avalanche defenseman Francois Beauchemin and in.

The Rangers took a 2-1 lead at 16:39 when Kreider's shot barely crossed the goal line before Avalanche defenseman Fedor Tyutin swept it out. Play continued and Ryan McDonagh fired it back in for the Rangers, but the video review concluded that Kreider had scored.

Colorado pulled back into a 2-2 tie on Comeau's sixth goal of the season. Rene Bourque stole the puck behind the goal line and got it to Beauchemin at the point. Comeau deflected Beauchemin's shot past Lundqvist, playing his first game after missing two scheduled starts because of the flu.

The Rangers took the lead for good midway through the second, when Barrie tried to drop the puck back to Bourque, but New York's Miller pounced on it and went the other way, beating Pickard to the far glove side from just outside the far edge of the left circle for the unassisted goal. And it was 4-2 at 14:20 of the second when Kreider deflected another Stepan shot past Pickard. Miller and Jimmy Vesey added third-period goals for the Rangers to complete the rout.

The Avalanche next heads out on a two-game trip, meeting the Canucks at Vancouver on Monday and the Flames at Calgary on Wednesday.

2431581567,"TURISMO ESPACIAL, PRIMEROS VIAJES PARA EL 2017
La carrera espacial, antes entendida como una lucha entre USA y la URSS que dio pie a una de las épocas más importantes de la historia contemporánea ya no existe. Pero el destino pronto le ha encontrado un sustituto, esta vez dentro del mismo territorio y entre compañías privadas, por eso de la sana competencia. SpaceX y Blue Origin. Elon Musk y Jeff Bezos.

A pesar de que ambas cabezas visibles de la nueva exploración espacial no son rivales de forma directa, o al menos eso dan a entender, lo cierto es que la revalidad entre las ambas compañía por la carrera espacial y por los contratos gubernamentales para la próxima misión tripulada fuera del ámbito de la ISS, está empujando a ambas compañías a competir entre sí, y eso no está beneficiando a todos a los que nos gustaría ver cómo el hombre pone el pie en Marte algún día.

Ahora, la compañía de Bezos, después del éxito de su última misión tiene otro hito en mente: empezar a hacer pruebas con humanos para ponerlos en el espacio antes de 2017, y además convertirlo en un negocio rentable a largo plazo, pues según el fundador de Blue Origin y Amazon, miles de personas tienen gran interés en pagar por un viaje en una nave suborbital, algo que puede servir además para realizar pruebas pertinentes antes de lanzarse al espacio.

La idea es hacer vuelos suborbitales para las masasNo obstante el plan de fondo no es convertirse en la gran compañía aeroespacial que algún día aterrice su nave en Acheron-426, pero si empezar con el desarrollo, fabricación y venta de motores y sistemas de cohetes para otras compañías como United Launch Alliance, la joint venture de Lockheed Martin Space Systems y Boeing Defense.

No obstante, a Jeff Bezos no le preocupa que Blue Origin sea o no la primera compañía privada de turismo espacial para las masas, pues el verdadero objetivo en el que está centrado la compañía ahora mismo es el de perfeccionar sus equipos para poder realizar 100 vuelos suborbitales al año."
2431581593,"Santa Clara University, whose Mission-style buildings sprawl across 110 palm-filled acres, is working hard to reduce car use on campus.

Its latest brainstorm: An autonomous shuttle, run by Santa Clara startup Auro Robotics, that quietly chugs around an almost 1-mile loop route with five designated stops.

School officials say they are the first U.S. university to test a self-driving shuttle, albeit one that has a safety engineer on board. The pilot program started in November and runs through February, after which the school will decide whether it wants to continue - and whether it will let the shuttle run with no backup human driver.

""We are shifting to a more urban campus environment and attempting to be more sustainable,"" said Chris Shay, assistant vice president of university operations. ""Auro came and said, 'We've got a monorail without rails.' It goes on a set route and there's no infrastructure to build. It fit perfectly with our vision.""

Auro, which employs just five people and has $2 million in seed backing, shows how relatively easy it is nowadays to get autonomous vehicles up and running. ""Five or six years back, you couldn't do this with $2 million,"" CEO Nalin Gupta said. ""But now there's a lot of open-source technology.""

Neil Datar, a senior who chairs the student Senate at Santa Clara University, said he relishes the looks on his friends' faces when he whizzes by aboard the shuttle. ""This is a cool novelty and shows how much the university is working toward innovation,"" he said. Long-term, he hopes it will help create safe transportation for disabled people and late-night students.

Laura Ellingson, a professor of communications and women's gender studies, who uses a cane because of a leg amputation, said the shuttle has potential to serve disabled people but isn't quite there yet. It can't accommodate a wheelchair or her Ninebot, a Segway-like standing scooter. Its hours are limited.

""In the future, it could be a more practical solution,"" she said. ""I appreciate it as a great way of trying to address the problem of getting around. I hope they will expand the route, make it possible to request it on demand, and make it possible to go directly to a particular place. But I'm thrilled that the administration is thinking forward and thinking about zero-staffing solutions.""

Boxy and high-roofed, the shuttle's look isn't related to its self-driving abilities. It's an off-the-shelf $30,000 four-person electric vehicle called the Polaris GEM - basically a heavy-duty golf cart with a top speed of 25 mph. At the university's request, it sticks to 7 mph on campus.

Auro spent another $30,000 to outfit the GEM with cameras, lidar (which is like radar but uses lasers), GPS sensors and controls for brakes and steering, all connected to deep-learning software. The vehicles come in sizes that accommodate two to 12 passengers, and Auro may use larger ones in the future. Future retrofits would be cheaper as the company deals with larger quantities.

With a driver, the GEM vehicles are legal on local roads, so Auro engineers can drive them from the company's nearby office in a rented house to the Santa Clara campus.

""It's simple, because we are running a fixed route with obstacle detection,"" said Ben Stinnett, an Auro engineer. ""Instead of real-time path planning to swerve around obstacles, we just slow down and come to a stop when there's a pedestrian or bicyclist ahead, because that's what the university wanted.""

A safety engineer sits in the navigator's seat with his hand on a throttle in case he needs to take control. There's also a bright orange emergency stop button that passengers can hit. In three weeks, the engineer has had to take over twice, both times because the car started to veer toward the grass due to a software bug. The electric vehicle also has some glitches; on a recent afternoon it was out of commission because it failed to charge properly.

Auro said it needs just a week to create a new shuttle route: a day to drive the loop to develop detailed 3-D maps and then a few days of computer simulation to work out bugs.

Santa Clara University is self-insured. Shay said it consulted with risk-management experts before agreeing to the test.

For the university, the shuttle fits its commitment to be climate neutral by 2020. It is offering incentives to get folks out of single-person cars and into carpooling, biking - and taking the free shuttle. It has moved aggressively to turn about 8 acres of parking and road space on the 110-acre campus into other uses: pedestrian walkways and a community garden, for instance.

The passage of Measure B, which increased Santa Clara County's sales tax to pay for transit improvements, means that eventually there will be a BART station near campus, in addition to the nearby Caltrain station; both are ripe for ""last mile"" connections, Shay said. ""We'd re-create the historic trolley that used to run here with a 21st century autonomous shuttle that could run 24/7.""

Self-contained and pedestrian-oriented, campuses make perfect testing grounds for driverless vehicles. Universities can make their own decisions about allowing the futuristic cars on their turf because they don't cross public roads.

""These limited environments are ideal for early experimentation and demonstration, in part because the challenges are simpler and the risk of harm is lower,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who is affiliated with Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. ""They're also areas with genuine transportation needs for which these slow-speed shuttles are especially well-suited.""

Auro hopes to set up pilots at other locations, including a retirement community and a corporate office complex, as well as another university, early this year, according to Gupta. He began developing autonomous technology in India eight years ago with his two co-founders, started the company two years ago, and graduated from the Y Combinator incubator last summer.

The company hopes to raise its first round of venture funding in January, double its size to 10 people and move to a new office.

Eventually, Auro plans to offer the service for $5,000 to $7,000 a month, including insurance and vehicle charging; theoretically the shuttles could run 24/7. By contrast, a bus driver's salary, gas and insurance come to about $9,000 a month, for 40 hours a week, and that doesn't include the cost of the vehicle. For now, since Santa Clara University is a test site, it pays a minimal amount of $200 to $400 a month.

While there may be some changes if the shuttle becomes a reality - no driver, faster speeds, navigating around obstacles, and remote monitoring - Auro says its top concern is being a good citizen.

""We want the campus population to see us as a courteous vehicle; nothing to be afraid of,"" Stinnett said.

 HIGHLIGHT: 
 The deaths of David Bowie, Prince and Leonard Cohen drew considerable attention in a year that also claimed Muhammad Ali and Fidel Castro.

Correction Appended

Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn't necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 - consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the back-to-back daughter-mother Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds - the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year.

Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona - androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist - was as shape-shifting as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue.

Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too?

Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his - I hesitate to say merry - way, ever the wise, gravel-voiced troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, ""Until then, here's another song.""

It was as if 2016 hadn't delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another pop-star death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas.

Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can't bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane; Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire.

Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man's mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the locked-up outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis's swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore.

And then there was George Martin, whose recording-studio genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle.

If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way.

Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking self-regard and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring.

Palmer, too, was transformational, golf's first media star. The gentleman's game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of middle-class postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome - but he was somehow one of them, too.

The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88; and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor's son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake - his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant - can sometimes never be lived down.

Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women's basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer's disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N.B.A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86; his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a 14-year Hall of Fame career, was 74.

Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the whites-only major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball's first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if?

A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country.

Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan's death evoked the 1980s White House, where old-Hollywood glamour and well-heeled West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn's had us thinking again about a long-ago burst of national pride soaring into outer space.

The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War's roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly's obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing's ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex., to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment.

On other shores, Fidel Castro's death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a cigar-smoking strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

If writers, too, are truth-seekers, even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, pre-eminently, Edward Albee - all dead in 2016.

But just as treasured were those who spun make-believe for our viewing pleasure - none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the nothing-dainty-about-her Princess Leia of the ""Star Wars"" tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother's grief.

Devotees of the ""Harry Potter"" movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape's younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor's celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career.

Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a therapy-obsessed culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the ""Godfather"" movies and ""Barney Miller,"" actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had.

On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his convention-defying meditations on life and art; Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives; Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics' eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists.

A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (""Adventures of Superman""), Alan Young (""Mister Ed""), Robert Vaughn (""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""), William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on ""The Patty Duke Show""), Dan Haggerty (""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams""), Florence Henderson (""The Brady Bunch"") and Alan Thicke (""Growing Pains""). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with ""Happy Days,"" ""Mork & Mindy,"" ""Laverne & Shirley"" and more, died at 81.

On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker's jacket with a camera slung around his neck - what a picture! - had split from the scene.

So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it.

Music's other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin; the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri; the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor); and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel.

Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a culture-changing executive, Grant Tinker, who in the '80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin.

And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude.

Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a conscience-stricken gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding.

By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone's guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.

2431588704,"As 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities.

How people are ushering in the new year: New York

An estimated 1 million people ushered in the new year in Times Square, screaming and kissing as the glittering crystal ball dropped.

New Year's Eve revelers began to fill Times Square hours before midnight. They braved cold temperatures and strong winds at the Crossroads of the World to greet 2017 amid heavy police protection.

Maria Raimilla, from New Jersey, said 2016 was rough.

""Everything is going to be new,"" she said at midnight. ""I just want to find happiness this year and leave all the bad things behind.""

Lori Haan of Tucson and her husband were on their first trip to New York. She said she's looking forward to what 2017 brings.

""This is a great start to the new year,"" she said. ""We are doing something new and exciting, and I hope that it's a theme for the rest of the year.""

Dozens of 20-ton sanitation trucks weighted with an extra 15 tons of sand blocked off streets leading to the celebration zone to avoid the possibility of a truck attack like those in Germany and France in recent months. About 7,000 police officers, along with specially armed counterterrorism units and bomb-sniffing dogs, were on guard.

Mariah Carey was the headline performer in Times Square for ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest"" on ABC. Las Vegas

More than 300,000 visitors were expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year's Eve celebration.

Nightclubs were pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city's celebrity chefs crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts.

A brief fireworks show was kicking off at midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos.

Federal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square.Germany

(Maja Hitij / Getty Images) In Berlin, the mood was more somber than celebratory.

""I don't like the way politics is going,"" Daniel Brandt said. ""Fears are being fanned, and people are so angry with each other.""

The tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the last two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Walking by the Reichstag, Germany's Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year.

""I came to Germany from Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Life is better here.""

Nicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: ""Brexit, Trump, Erdogan - it's all getting worse.""

""I'm a convinced European, and I hope Europe doesn't collapse in 2017,"" she said.

Later, police said they arrested a man who shouted ""bomb, bomb, bomb"" at Berlin's massive open-air New Year's party.Turkey

New Year's celebrations turned violent in Istanbul when at least one armed assailant believed to have been dressed in a Santa Claus costume opened fire at a nightclub.

At least 35 people were killed and dozens of others injured in the attack, according to Istanbul's governor, Vasip Sahin.

Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus or street vendors.

Ankara and Istanbul have been targeted by several attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels, killing more than 180 people.

Neslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighborhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with ""unrest and death.""

""2016 affected everyone badly,"" she said.France

(Lionel Bonaventure / AFP/ Getty Images) Tourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris' illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights.

""It's so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world's most beautiful avenue,"" said Maureen O'Reilly, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. ""At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything.""

Some people were happy to say goodbye to 2016.

""It's been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,"" said Karine Dublot, from Lyon.Russia

President Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year's Eve remarks to the nation.

""Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,"" Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia's 11 time zones. ""To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret.""

New Year's Eve is Russia's major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery.The Vatican

(Alessandro Bianchi / Pool photo) Pope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of ""a culture that idolizes youth"" but has made no place for the young.

Francis said during vespers marking New Year's Eve that young people have been ""pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future."" Japan

Temple bells echoed at midnight as families gathered around noodles and revelers flocked to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan.

Kami Miyamoto, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, traveled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. ""The world is heading toward conservative, insular policies,"" she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. ""We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.""China

(Greg Baker / AFP/ Getty Images) Residents in Beijing and Shanghai, China's two largest cities, were passing New Year's Eve quietly under a virtual security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police.

The Bund waterfront in Shanghai would have no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai would be prohibited.

Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai's waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show.

Beijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities would not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. They advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his New Year's Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China's territorial rights.South Korea

Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park's impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal.

The evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul's traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight.

The city's mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan's World War II military.

Park Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster.India

(Raminder Pal Singh / European Presphoto Agency) For most people in India, New Year's Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars.

The western city of Mumbai was hosting big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money - India's recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion.The Philippines

The Philippines' notorious tradition of dangerous New Year's Eve celebrations persisted this year after President Rodrigo Duterte postponed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire.

Firecrackers and gunfire maim hundreds of people and kill some each year across the Philippines, despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays.

Duterte's southern Davao City hasn't been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was the city's crime-busting mayor. But he said in November that he would delay his plan to replicate the Davao ban nationwide by a year because many people had already invested in firecrackers, and he was concerned about the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry.Romania

New Year's is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands of people flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate -- some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017.

Former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, traveling to the mountain town of Sinaia, said Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood.

""People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,"" he said. ""Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.""

Early Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats, a New Year symbol, while waving wands made of dried flowers.United Arab Emirates

There was no repeat of the chaos of last year, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at a skyscraper nearby.Australia

Sydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016's fallen icons with a New Year's Eve fireworks display honoring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year.

The glittering display over Sydney's harbor and bridge featured Saturn- and star-shaped fireworks set to ""Space Oddity,"" the classic song by Bowie, among the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016.

Wilder was honored as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colors while a song from his film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" played.Finland

Finland kicked off celebrations for 100 years of independence from Russia.

Tens of thousands of people gathered in Helsinki for a concert and a huge fireworks display.

Throughout 2017, there will be hundreds of events in the Nordic nation of 5.5 million, including films, dance parties, environment-related events, concerts and activities linked to its renowned sauna tradition.

Celebrations will culminate on Dec. 6, the day the Finnish parliament declared independence in 1917 amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution.Mexico City

Thousands of people in Mexico City were expected to turn out for a New Year's Eve concert at the Monument to Independence, better known as the Angel. Workers spent several days setting up a stage and a booming sound system along a stretch of the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Streets were blocked off in the area, and 2,000 police officers were on hand for security.

The lineup included a mix of Latin pop and balladeer Jorge ""Coque"" Muniz, with cumbia band Los Angeles Azules heating things up after a midnight fireworks show. Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016.

2431588796,"Big shows, new venues, city-wide festivals ... there's a lot of culture coming Denver's way this year. Here are 10 things-in-the-making that warrant serious anticipation.

Feb. 3-March 12, The Denver Center's timely take on climate change

Theater companies plan so far in advance that they never know exactly how a show will resonate when it finally gets on stage. The timing seems just right, though, for ""Two Degrees,"" which weaves climate change issues into the story of a researcher's own personal upheavals. The work was developed at the Denver Center's in-house Colorado New Play Summit and is so connected to current events that playwright Tira Palmquist is retooling the words right now to reflect evolving political dialogue.

Feb. 11-May 7, The MCA's landmark look at early Basquiat

The Museum of Contemporary Art Denver authors an important and so far unwritten chapter in American art with the exhibit ""Basquiat Before Basquiat: East 12th Street, 1979-1980."" Jean-Michel Basquiat - who went from tagging graffiti on Lower Manhattan streets to showing expressionist paintings at the Whitney before dying in 1988 at the age of 27 - remains one of the 20th century's most enigmatic geniuses and this show looks at the time when he was developing his voice. It's sure to get international attention. Info: mcadenver.org .

Feb. 19-Oct. 22, DAM digs in with ""Mi Tierra""

The Denver Art Museum's contemporary art department is back in full swing now that curator Rebecca R. Hart has had time to get her feet on the ground and ""Mi Tierra: Contemporary Artists Explore Place"" is her first big move. Thirteen Latino artists will each install a piece exploring their ideas about living in the Western United States. Participants include rising names in the field, like L.A.'s Ramiro Gomez, Austin's Xochi Solis and Denver's Dmitri Obergfell. Info: denverartmuseum.org .

March 2-4, Opera Colorado's game-changing ""As One""

Opera Colorado, known for a quarter-century for presenting larger-than-life classical music warhorses, tries something completely different with composer Laura Kaminsky's ""As One."" The piece, which premiered in 2014, uses just two singers and a string quartet and chronicles the journey of a transgender woman as she ""endeavors to resolve the discord between herself and the outside world."" The small chamber opera goes to a smaller venue, the performing arts complex at the Pinnacle Charter School in way North Denver. Info: operacolorado.org .

March and April, Month of Photography

Denver's Month of Photography comes around every two years filling virtually every inch of wall space in the region with the work of photographers near and far. The RedLine art center is the official host, but just about all local museums and galleries pull out the stops, with off-beat venues in the mix, ranging from the State Capitol to Cake Crumbs bakery to Children's Hospital. There's a list of attractions, which seems to grow everyday, on the website. Info: mopdenver.com .

April 9-July 16, DAM and CSM team up to show Mark Bradford

The Denver Art Museum and the Clifford Still Museum share more than a property line in the Golden Triangle. They also have terrific abstract expressionist collections that will serve as a filter for showing Mark Bradford's skills to the city. Bradford is on one the most in-demand contemporary painters today and traces his inspirational roots back to the late Clyfford Still's 20th century masterpieces. ""Shade: Clyfford Still / Mark Bradford"" will have DAM exhibiting his recent paintings alongside some masterpieces from its own collection. Concurrently, the Still will have a show of Clyfford Still paintings curated by Bradford himself. Info: denverartmuseum.org .

Late summer, The Biennial of the America's returns

This every-other-year event is set for a big comeback in 2017. Details are still being worked out, but expect a week-long, city-wide exploration of art, culture, politics, business and more, all filling the organization's mission of helping people across the Western Hemisphere share their best ideas and strategies (and, hopefully, some of their best music). The biennial has serious partners this go-round in both the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Denver Art Museum, so the quality should be high. Info: biennialoftheamericas.org .

Sept. 9, Brett Mitchell's big CSO moment

The Colorado Symphony Orchestra welcomes its new music director, Brett Mitchell, with a showy kickoff, a season-starting concert featuring opera superstar Renée Fleming as the special guest. All eyes, and ears, will be on Mitchell, who at just 37, was hired to replace Andrew Litton this year, becoming one of the youngest maestros to lead a major orchestra. Info: coloradosymphony.org .

Mid-September, Denver Center's Space Theater reopens

The Denver Center's renovation of its most interesting venue, the Space Theater, is set for completion just in time for the start of its 2017-18 season. The new venue will keep its trademark, in-the-round set up, but promises to be even more intimate, dropping from 550 seats to 416. The project, funded by a $10 million present from Better Denver bond funds, will make the place more flexible and more accessible to all audiences. Be on the lookout for upcoming programming announcements. Info: denvercenter.org .

Mid-November, the Kirkland Museum reopens

The Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art takes its rightful place as one of the city's major cultural institutions with a move from its cramped, Capitol Hill headquarters to a shiny, new building in the Golden Triangle museum district. The Kirkland's still-growing collection of art and decorative objects is unrivaled in the West and its new home, clad in colorful tiles and designed by architect Jim Olson, promises to be a city landmark. The exact opening date depends on the construction schedule but - so far, anyway - things are moving along nicely. Info: kirklandmuseum.org .

.#фондобщественногоразвития

Ничего не случится, если вы пропустите известия о том, что в Китае родился поросёнок с двумя пятачками, а британские учёные разгадали тайну пропажи второго носка. Но есть важные тренды, которые влияют на наш быт, работу и развлечения. Именно о них рассказали эксперты. 

Редактор рассылки «Письма о будущем», в которой он рассказывает о том, как новые открытия, тренды и технологии меняют мир. 
Колонизация Марса - дело ближайших лет 

Так же, как и перенос тяжёлой промышленности в космос и космический туризм. Это показали запуски SpaceX, Blue Origin и Virgin Galactic. Правда, они выявили и массу проблем, которые предстоит решить перед тем, как мы покинем эту планету. 

Итоги 2016 года: Колонизация Марса - дело ближайших лет 
Помните мечты Рэя Брэдбери? 
А покинуть, по мнению Стивена Хокинга, придётся. Знаменитый учёный считает, что не стоит складывать все яйца в одну корзину (читай: на одной хрупкой планете, которую мы уже слегка раздолбали). 

Дорогая, я улучшил детей 

Технология редактирования генома захватила медицинские и технологические СМИ ещё в начале года. А в ноябре китайские учёные впервые использовали CRISPR для лечения людей. Учитывая потенциал технологии, это фантастический прорыв, чья безопасность, правда, всё ещё под вопросом. Перспективы же колоссальны: от борьбы с ранее неизлечимыми заболеваниями до безупречных с точки зрения генетики, «дизайнерских» детей. 

Виртуальная реальность наступит в 2017 году 

VR- и AR-технологии пока буксовали. Масса попыток и ни одного прорыва. Но всё указывает на то, что 2017-й станет переломным этапом для индустрии. 

VR захватит прямые трансляции и, возможно, заглянет в кинотеатры. Начнутся эксперименты с корпоративным VR (полноценные рабочие места в трёхмерном виртуальном пространстве) и социальными сетями 2.0. Последнее - очевидный вектор развития Facebook, вспомните октябрьскую презентацию на конференции Oculus Connect. 

Четверть века назад CNN совершил маленькую революцию: его репортёры освещали войну в Персидском заливе в прямом эфире. Так появился термин «эффект CNN». Это когда во время громких событий всё внимание приковано к СМИ, а «заурядная» жизнь замирает. 

В этом году мы перешли ещё один Рубикон: иракские военные показали операцию по освобождению Мосула в Periscope. Впервые в истории войну стримили с таким размахом и таким количеством лайков. 

В следующем году будет достаточно пустить прямую трансляцию в VR, чтобы получить не просто потоковое видео, а опыт, который вполне может изменить то, как мы потребляем и воспринимаем новости. 

Слово года - постправда 

Теперь мы официально живём в мире, где общественное мнение формируется на основании эмоций и личных взглядов людей. Термин здорово передаёт суть инфопространства: эмоциональный заряд обгоняет факт, а сам факт подают под абсолютно разными соусами. Постправдивые президентские выборы в США и брекзит - примеры, которые сложно представить годом ранее. 

Жизнь или шоу? По мере развития медийных технологий всё сложнее отличить одно от другого. И мы в самом начале этого пути.

В Англии был период, названный историками «Овцы съели людей». Крестьян массово выгоняли с их земель, чтобы разводить на освободившихся площадях овец. Доход с продажи шерсти был выше, чем с налогов с крестьян. 

Сейчас мы на пороге периода «Алгоритмы съели людей». Больше всего пострадают профессии, которые можно алгоритмизировать, а общение передать системам распознавания речи и чат-ботам. 

Итоги 2016 года: Вас заменят роботы 

Спрос на бухгалтеров уже который год падает на 30%. Дело не в экономический ситуации, а во внедрении IT-технологий: когда один бухгалтер может вести не одну, а 3-5 компаний без ущерба для качества. Также почти исчез спрос на страховых агентов. И скоро будет волна сокращений в банковской сфере. 

Следующий этап дожуёт тех, кто далёк от компьютеров и офисных кресел. Он настанет, когда роботы станут дешевле. Тогда они будут выполнять физическую работу. Посмотрите, как работают роботы-грузчики на складе Amazon. 

Конечно, человек никуда не денется. Он будет творцом алгоритмизированных и роботизированных систем. Но ниша нашей применимости будет всё уже. Это открывает огромные возможности для тех, кто хочет и готов работать головой. Но придётся много и упорно учиться и постоянно узнавать новое, больше заниматься своим развитием. 

Станьте незаменимым экспертом, иначе останутся только низкоквалифицированные вакансии.

Старость - новая молодость 

В России формируется новая точка зрения на старость. Теперь это не «возраст дожития», как сформулировано в документах Минтруда, а период, когда можно реализоваться, наконец, после того, как поставил семью на ноги. 

Заявивший о себе в 2012 году проект Владимира Яковлева «Возраст счастья» развивается, а вместе с ним и тренды на естественную красоту с морщинками и спорт для любого возраста. А аудитория социальных сетей запомнила 89-летнюю бабу Лену из Красноярска, путешествующую по миру. 

Люди объединяются в сообщества 

Многие хотят иметь рядом человека со схожим мировоззрением, того, с кем можно общаться на интересные темы. Очень заметны, например, такие сообщества: 

Сообщества мам. Это женщины, у которых много вопросов и сложностей. Городская среда не предназначена для них: с коляской в метро не спустишься, надо брать с собой еду при выходе в город, а ещё как-то работать и воспитывать ребёнка. Возникают локальные сообщества, даже закрытые, где мамы обмениваются опытом. Государство не может или не берёт на себя функцию обеспечения их жизни, и они сами начинают помогать друг другу. 
Сообщества людей, придерживающихся здорового образа жизни. Это люди, которые начинают задумываться над питанием, над тем, чтобы больше двигаться, соблюдать баланс белков, жиров и углеводов. И правильное питание уже воспринимается не как диета, а как норма.

2431591904,"The Franklin County Visitors Bureau completed purchase of a former bank in downtown Chambersburg to create a visitor center and home for the organization.

(PRWEB) December 31, 2016

On December 29, the Franklin County Visitors Bureau (FCVB) completed purchase of a former bank property at 15 South Main Street on the southwest quadrant of Chambersburg's Memorial Square. The nearly 10,000-sq. ft. building will be a launching point for visitors to Franklin County, providing a variety of rotating exhibits, displays of local art, originating tours to destinations throughout the county, and providing expanded awareness to Franklin County's events and destinations. FCVB will utilize the bank's vault as a small theatre for visitors to view a variety of videos, including ""Road to Freedom: Underground Railroad of South Mountain"" and ""1864 Burning of Chambersburg."" In addition, an area will be designated as a resource library of local publications and online resources of Franklin County. As FCVB's new home, 15 South Main Street will house the administrative offices and include a 950-sq.ft. meeting and event space for FCVB to stage seminars, presentations, and hold community events.

Along with the new location, FCVB is planning to begin a Certified Tourism Ambassador (CTA) Program to create an educated, trained pool of volunteers to interpret and share the many stories of Franklin County. With significant early American, Underground Railroad, and Civil War history, Franklin County has a rich heritage. Complementing this history are important PA conservation stories, fresh foods, seasons of festivals, performing arts venues, varied arts and artisan initiatives, and distinctive community architecture. All will be incorporated into specific Franklin County training and will give many opportunities for CTAs to tell Franklin County's stories.

But this wasn't over the so-called ""Amazon Tax law,"" a heavily contested Colorado law that required out-of-state internet retailers to inform customers of sales tax owed. The 2010 law, which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in December , remains as is.

The 452,400-square-foot facility is a sortation center, which means wrapped packages arrive and are then sorted by ZIP code and delivered to appropriate neighborhood post offices.

The company also launched Amazon Flex in search of contract workers who would use their own cars to deliver Amazon packages - for $18 to $25 per hour. And the company opened its first Colorado store - a pop-up at the Park Meadows Mall in Lone Tree.

While 2016 was the Seattle retailer's first physical entry into the state, it will unlikely be its last. Amazon has quietly been seeking developers and other technology workers and is rumored to be scouting for office space in downtown Denver .

Today, the only remnants of the retailer that could trace its roots in Colorado back to Gart Bros. Sporting Goods are hundreds of thousands of square feet of empty big-box retail space and the Sports Authority Field at Mile High signs still emblazoned across the Denver Broncos' stadium.

Neither of those are long for this world. Other retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond and REI , have begun snapping up the best real estate and more announcements are sure to come in 2017.

The Broncos haven't set a timetable to find a new naming rights partner , but you better believe the reigning Super Bowl champs don't want to play a second straight season in a stadium bearing the name of a company that no longer exists.

2431607588,Four things SpaceX can do in 2017 to get its groove back https://t.co/qQwIGLCVfu
2431610400,"By Tony Munroe and Jack Kim

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Sunday that the isolated nuclear capable country was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

North Korea tested ballistic missiles at an unprecedented rate during 2016, although some experts have said it is years away from developing an ICBM fitted with a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the United States.

""Research and development of cutting edge arms equipment is actively progressing and ICBM rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage,"" Kim said during a televised New Year's Day speech.

The country has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The sanctions were tightened last month after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 9.

A successful ICBM test launch would mark a significant step forward for secretive Pyongyang's weapons capability. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,418 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or further. The U.S. state of California is roughly 9,000 km from North Korea.

However, North Korea has struggled to reliably deploy its intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile, succeeding just once in eight attempted launches last year.

The Musudan is designed to fly about 3,000 km (1,860 miles), posing a threat to South Korea and Japan, and possibly the U.S. territory of Guam.

South Korea's defence ministry declined to comment on whether North Korea would test launch an ICBM soon.

TRUMP REQUESTED NORTH KOREA BRIEFING

According to a senior U.S. intelligence official, President-elect Donald Trump's first and at that time only request for a special classified intelligence briefing was for one on North Korea and its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea and its nuclear programme has also been of interest to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trump's choice for national security advisor and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

An Chan-il, a former North Korean military officer who defected to the South and runs a think tank in Seoul, said Kim will gauge Trump's comments about his country for potential interest in dialogue and determine whether to try and conduct an ICBM test launch.

""If Trump comes in and the North does not get a good signal in terms of how the relationship between the two countries is going to go, that'll give them another reason to do it,"" An said.

Kim also said that the North would continue to develop its pre-emptive nuclear strike capability if the United States and South Korea continue to conduct annual joint military exercises.

There are 28,500 U.S. troops based in South Korea, and North Korean state media often describes annual joint exercises as preparation for an attack.

In February, North Korea launched a satellite into space, which was widely seen as a test of long-range ballistic missile technology.

A senior U.S. military official said last month that North Korea appears able to mount a miniaturised nuclear warhead on a missile but is still struggling with missile re-entry technology necessary for longer range strikes.

Although it fired a variety of missile types last year, North Korea is not known to have test-launched a ballistic missile since October.

2431613996,"Organic gardening means gardening without using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. It does not mean leaving everything to chance and using no products at all. In fact, for an organic gardener, the more assertive the better!

There are many practices and many USDA approved and Texas Department of Agriculture approved products ready to help defend against the bugs and weeds that plague gardens. The idea is to use a comprehensive approach to protection rather than using ""one size fits all"" chemicals that may do more than you want them to. You can learn before-planting practices and after-planting practices that can be employed to stop problems before they ever start, as well as which methods and products you can turn to when hungry bugs and nutrient-mooching weeds show up.

As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Prevent the spread of viral and fungal diseases with sanitation practices. Use a wire brush or running water to clean tools, stakes, or trellises before using them again. You can even use a 1/10, bleach/water dip for spades and shears if you know you've encountered some microbial beasties. Send infected debris to the trashcan or burn pile rather than the compost bin when plants have fallen prey to a viral disease. You will know that is the case when you see mosaic shaped blotches or sharp edges or yellow spots, basically, any oddity than can only have occurred from within rather than an outside source. Plan to rotate crops in your vegetable garden. Just moving a crop five feet over will separate it from the disease and/or bad nematodes that may lie in the soil from the prior year. What harms brassica vegetables will likely not bother a root crop. You may also want to consider staking, caging, or trellising to reduce rot as well as save space. Also, remember that moisture spreads spores of diseases from one plant to another, so weed sucker plants and pick produce while dry.

Knowing your garden and what challenges face your selection of herbs, vegetables, or ornamentals is the key to planning adequate, organic pest management and properly preparing the soil. Know what pH level and specific nutrients your plants grow best with and select compost types accordingly. Once your garden is growing, check for signs of trouble daily so that you can address any malady before it is beyond control. Be aggressive, don't let the problem worsen, find the name of the cause by checking with your local extension office or simply using search engines. Once you have identified the culprit, you can find a matching remedy that will help your garden continue to thrive.

2431628554,"1st Book of 2K17 is Elon Musk stories about Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity. I really admire his vision about changing the world and save humanity, I would like to share some point I learn about this book in next few days.

Latest book that I read was David and Goliath (book) by Malcolm Gladwell, this is the must read story to understand the advantages of disadvantages, here's what I learned from this book:

Sometimes the disadvantages become the advantages for some people, and so does advantages become disadvantages. Actually it depends on the ""How"" we react through it, effort trump ability.

I love the story about taking risk and turn disadvantages to power in chapter four, he's hustling his way into the top places and become one of great leader in the company by making decision that changing his entire life. Here's the quote I love in this chapter: ""Most of us won't take the opportunity because we would have worry about the consequences"".
Another story in this Chapter is about David Bowie that has Dyslexia in his life, so he's not so good at read, we can call even so worst at it. That doesn't stop him, but he became so extraordinary listener to overcome the weakness instead.

I also love the chapter five, it talked about conquering the fear and also taking risk. Here's the quote that I love: ""Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you can earn when you've been through the tough times and discover they aren't so tough after all"". There are so many things happen in this life, either will build us up or put us down.

(P.s: 1st chapter in Elon Musk's Books is about Elon's World and I already found something interested connected with David and Goliath book about how disadvantages become the advantages: Elon had many schedules, Ashlee ask him how to survive the schedule and Musk said: ""I had a tough childhood, so maybe that was helpful"".)

Looking forward to hear some story if you have (or would) read this book, sharing the knowledge will be fun way to learn. Have a great week ahead!"

9. A solar powered airplane flew across the Pacific Ocean for the first time, highlighting a new era of energy possibilities.

10. Costa Rica's entire electrical grid ran on renewable energy for over half the year, and their capacity continues to grow.

11. Israeli and US researchers believe they are on the brink of being able to cure radiation sickness, after successful tests this year.

12. An Ebola vaccine was developed by Canadian researchers with 100% efficacy. Humans eradicated horror, together.

13. British Columbia protected 85% of the world's largest temperate rainforest, in a landmark environmental agreement.

14. 2016 saw the designation of more than 40 new marine sanctuaries in 20 countries, covering an area larger than the United States.

15. Atmospheric acid pollution across world, which was once a gloomy reality, has been tackled to the point of being almost back to pre-industrial levels. Off-course, excluding Delhi. 

16. Major diseases are in decline. The US saw a 50% mortality drop in colon cancer; lower heart disease, osteoporosis and dementia.

17. Israel now produces 55% of its freshwater, turning what is one of the driest countries on earth into an agricultural heartland. This is something that both karnataka and Tamilnadu should learn upon than fighting against each other. 

18. People pouring ice on their head (Ice bucket challenge) amusingly provided the ALS foundation with enough funding to isolate a genetic cause of the disease.

19. SpaceX made history by landing a rocket upright after returning from space, potentially opening a new era of space exploration.

20. Finally Leicester city won the premier league title for the first time breaking all odds! 

There are countless more examples, big and small. If you refocus on the things that you were working, your year will be better than the last. 

Happy new year folks.

A Man with a Quest.

""No, I don't ever give up. I'd have to be dead or completely incapacitated."" - Elon Musk
.
Been spending the night and day reading a biography book: ""Elon Musk, How the Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping Our Future"". He is the leader of the game changing companies - SpaceX, Tesla, and Solar City. Amazingly, each companies are able to disrupt its own industries.
.
Many people know Musk in his best shape - as a multi billionaire genius from Sillicon Valley. SpaceX, a cost-leader company that able to radically reducing costs (that lots of people think impossible), is making huge progress in completing its goals: send colonialization to Mars. On the other hand, Tesla with its upcoming mass market car Tesla model 3. Last but not least, Solar City that able to accelerate penetration of sustainable energy application in the world.
.
However, least people know the ups and downs that Musk and his team has to gone through. In this book, you will see how he had the worst years of his life: three times explotion of multi-million rockets, cash flow trouble that brought Tesla near bankcruptcy -  TWICE, and trust issues other parties that thought that his ideas was a joke.
.
.
Musk's clear vision, perseverance, and ability to learn fast and take pressure on a whole new level brought him and his companies out of crisis. From many articles, it is said that he hasn't taken any holiday in the last 4 years and sleep just 6 hours a day on average. As a leader, sometimes he could be very demanding, but he always making sure that there is NO OBSTACLES for his team to accomplish their objective.
.
Through this biography, Musk share with us his life value: be crazy for what you believe in. His value also brought him to the top of his life - said to be ""Steven Job of our time"".

2431633677,"مهمترین و پیشروترین موفقیت های علمی در سال 2016
توسط امید امیدی ·

شاید بسیاری از افراد وقتی به سال ۲۰۱۶ فکر می کنند فقط نکات منفی (از انتخابات ریاست جمهوری آمریکا گرفته تا فوت چندین هنرمند مشهور در اواخر سال) را به خاطر بیاورند. اما سالی که دیشب به پایان رسید تماما سیاه نبود. ۲۰۱۶ سالی بود که محققین و دانشمندان به پیدا کردن راهکاری مناسب برای درمان سرطان، تایید نظریه های ۱۰۰ ساله و پیدا کردن موجوداتی که در کرات دیگر آسمانی زندگی می کنند نزدیکتر شدند. در ادامه شش کشف مهم علمی که بسیار مهم و پیشگامانه به نظر می رسند گردآوری شده است. با دیجی رو همراه باشید.

 

کشف امواج گرانشی که دنیای نجوم را تکان داد

ligo

دانشمندان رصدخانه لیزری امواج گرانشی تداخلی (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory -LIGO) وقتی گزارشات خود در مورد کشف موجهای گرانشی را منتشر کردند دنیای نجوم و ستاره‌شناسی را تکان دادند. آنها نه تنها موج های فضا-زمان را کشف کردند، بلکه منبع این امواج را نیز مشخص کردند. طبق گزارش منتشر شده، علت پیدایش این موج ها برخورد دو سیاهچاله بوده که ۱٫۳ میلیارد سال پیش اتفاق افتاده است. وجود این موج ها در اوایل قرن ۲۰ میلادی توسط آلبرت انیشتین به صورت تئوری مطرح شده بود، اما جامعه فیزیک تا این زمان تکنولوژی لازم برای مشاهده و آزمایش این امواج را نداشت. به نظر می رسد که بالاخره این تئوری بعد از ۱۰۰ سال اثبات شده است.

استفاده از مهندسی ژنتیک برای درمان سرطان

dna-editing

امسال برای اولین بار دانشمندان با استفاده از ابزار مهندسی ژنتیک به نام CRISPR-Cas9 سلولهای ایمنی‌ای طراحی کردند که به بدن بیمار وارد شده و به سلولهای سرطانی حمله می کند. گروهی از محققان چینی با استفاده از این روش در حال درمان سرطان ریه هستند. این تیم مقداری از گلبولهای سفید بیمار را از بدن وی خارج کردند، سپس با استفاده از تکنیک های جدید آنها را طوری به صورت ژنتیکی مهندسی کردند که به سلولهای سرطانی حمله کنند، و در نهایت این گلبولهای سفید را دوباره به بدن بیمار تزریق کردند تا با سرطان مبارزه کنند. در صورتی که این آزمایش های اولیه موفقیت آمیز باشند، پزشکان روش جدید و موثری برای درمان سرطان خواهند داشت. این آزمایشات یکی از اولین مراحلی است که تکنولوژی فوق پیشرفته را به دنیای طبابت نزدیک می کند.

باز هم تسلا با خلاقیت های خود در حال جابجا کردن مرزهای تکنولوژی حمل و نقل است. این شرکت از سال ۲۰۰۸ با ارائه تسلا رودستر، اولین خودروی اسپرت الکتریکی، نام خود را بر سر زبانها انداخت. موفقیت های این شرکت با ارائه مدل لوکس سدان S ادامه یافت، تا جایی که این مدل در انتهای نوامبر سال ۲۰۱۶ عنوان دومین اتومبیل پرفروش برقی تاریخ را کسب کرد. این کمپانی اعلام کرده که تمامی خودروهای ساخت این شرکت، از جمله مدل بسیار ارزان قیمت ۳۵٫۰۰۰ دلاری تسلا ۳، دارای قابلیت حرکت بدون راننده خواهد بود. این حالت رانندگی اتوماتیک که فعلا تسلا در حال آزمایش آن است متشکل از سیستم های هدایت مستقل، پردازش رادار و سیستم های ضد برخورد و تصادف است. سرنشینان در ترافیک های شلوغ می توانند با خیال راحت رانندگی را به خودرو سپرده و به کارهای دیگر خود برسند.

موشک های که قابلیت مصرف چندین باره دارند به واقعیت تبدیل شدند

تابحال موشک ها یکی از گرانترین و مهمترین اجزا در انجام ماموریت های فضایی بوده اند. معمولا این موشک ها فضاپیماها را به مدار خود می بردند و چون قابلیت استفاده دوباره از آنها وجود نداشت به چشم یک زباله به آنها نگاه می شد. اما حالا کمپانی SpaceX که متعلق به ایلان ماسک است موشک هایی طراحی کرده که بعد از انجام ماموریت فضایی خود در امنیت و سلامت کامل به زمین بازگردند. پس از بازگشت این موشک به زمین، با انجام آماده سازی هایی می توان دوباره از آن در انجام ماموریت های فضایی استفاده کرد. این کمپانی تابه حال آزمایش های ناموفق زیادی داشته، اما در سال ۲۰۱۶ با ارتقا تکنولوژی خود به موفقیت و ارائه محصول نهایی نزدیک تر شده است. تا ماه جولای ۲۰۱۶، این کمپانی با انجام یک سلسله آزمایش های موفق، توانست ۵ موشک را در مدت ۸ ماه سالم و امن در محل های مشخص فرود آورد.

معلولی که با استفاده از دست مصنوعی می تواند فشار را احساس کند

ناتان کاپلند بعد از تصادفی که ۱۰ سال پیش داشت، دیگر توانایی تکان دادن یا حس کردن دست و پای خود را نداشت. اما به کمک محققین دانشگاه پیتزبورگ، آقای کاپلند توانایی حرکت یک دست مصنوعی با استفاده از مغز خود را پیدا کرده. همچنین محققین قابلیت ""بازخورد احساسی"" را در این دست تعبیه کرده اند، کاپلند با استفاده از این ویژگی فشارهای وارد به این دست مصنوعی را نیز می تواند حس کند. این سیستم به قدری دقیق است که کاپلند می تواند فشارهای وارده به تک تک انگشتان را مثل یک دست واقعی حس کند. به گفته او استفاده از این دست مصنوعی تجربه واقعا عجیبی است. او بعد از انجام عمل جراحی برای پیوند این دست اظهار کرد که گاهی اوقات انگشتها حس ضربان الکتریکی یا فشاری دارند، اما در بیشتر مواقع این انگشت ها دقت بسیار بالایی دارند و حس انگشتان واقعی خود او را تداعی می کنند.

ستاره شناسان یک سیاره قابل سکونت پیدا کردند

بسیاری از منجمین باور دارند که ما در این جهان تنها نیستیم و موجودات دیگری نیز در کرات دوردست زندگی می کنند، به همین دلیل تلاش برای یافتن حیات در سایر نقاط دنیا همیشه وجود داشته است. با کشف سیاره ای در صورت فلکی قنطورس که به نظر می رسد شرایط مساعد را برای زندگی داشته باشد، یک گام بلند در زمینه پیدا کردن موجودات غیرزمینی برداشته شده است. این سیاره که Proxima b نامگذاری شده ۴٫۲۴ سال نوری با زمین فاصله دارد و به همین دلیل نمی توان به سادگی آن را به طور کامل مورد بررسی قرار داد. نتایج اولیه نشان می دهند که این سیاره دارای سطحی محکم و خاکی است و مانند بسیاری دیگر از اجرام آسمانی از گاز تشکیل نشده. این سیاره در محدوده کوتوله قرمز Proxima Centauri قرار دارد. Proxima Centauri نزدیکترین ستاره به خورشید است."

A slew of private space companies have entered the market with ambitious plans to build rockets and colonize new planets. SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin-each led by well-known entrepreneurs-have become household names.

Chelsey Pippin Commissioning Editor Ailbhe Malone BuzzFeed Staff It's been a long year, and the jury's still out on what to expect for 2017... But good or bad, one thing's for sure: We're all going to need to take a little break and have some fun once in a while. So why not load your phone up with a couple of the best games we played this year so you're always ready to zone out when you need to? All year we've been serving up lists of the , and offering recommendations from BuzzFeed writers every week . So here's just a few of our favourites! 1. Exploding Kittens Hiding in a deck of weird things is an exploding kitten. Draw it and you're screwed - so most of the game is spent playing cards to avoid drawing cards and marvelling at the weird and wonderful illustrations by the creator of The Oatmeal.

THIS IS MY FAVOURITE GAME, and the mobile version is just as excellent as the hard-copy tabletop version, so invest in both.

Get the mobile version for iOS and Android. Buy the tabletop version here. 2. 80 Days If you only download one game on this list, make it 80 Days. Guys, it's just so good. I am going to describe it now, and it's not going to sound appealing, but it really is.

80 Days is steampunk-influenced text-based trading adventure following Phileas Fogg on his journey around the world.

It is so funny, and smart and addictive - and bears multiple replays (I have been playing it for over a year now, with different objectives each time).

Get it for iOS here and for Android here.

BTW, if you like this kind of game, I can recommend Inkle's other offerings, such as Down Among the Dead Men and Sorcery! 3. Ingress You've probably heard of Pokémon Go at this point. BUT HAVE YOU HEARD OF INGRESS? It's an app-based augmented reality game that predates Pokémon Go and is actually pretty awesome, especially if you, like me, have a lot of deep-seeded childhood issues related to your parents not allowing you to play good old-fashioned analogue Pokémon.

Basically Ingress is like a super-intense sci-fi capture-the-flag. It's locationally based and requires you to visit landmarks in your area in order to capture portals located there for your team.

Granted, it loses out on the Pokémon cute factor, but when you're ready to play with the big kids, Ingress is the next level up.

Get it for iOS and Android. 4. Alto's Adventure This addicting indie game is well worth £2.99, especially if you're looking for something chill but absorbing.

Rachael says: ""It's an endless snowboarding game - you can never complete it but it imposes challenges. It's a simple, beautifully illustrated game and a perfect way to switch your mind off.""

Get it for iOS, and Android. 5. Level With Me This adorable game will keep you busy on commutes and is insanely addictive. It's simple enough: Beat mini games to keep your surface level in the face of heavy bowling balls, dynamite, zombies, and more.

Get it for iOS and Android. 6. Just Dance Now This is a seriously fun, active game you can play alone or with friends. It's basically DDR on your phone: Simply sync your mobile up with a computer and follow the the dance moves on screen to burn the calories and the competition. Get it for iOS and Android. 7. Zen Koi This delightful little game is perfect for chilling out. You can zone out without no pressure while raising some lovely fish and maybe even helping them become dragons (!!!). It's not complex or fast-paced, making it a perfect before-bed wind-down.Get it for iOS and Android. 8. I'm so sorry for introducing you to this - you will never get any work done again. is like Minecraft for elements: Combine fire and sand to make glass, combine glass with water to make...well, you'll have to figure that one out.

Play it here. 9. Leo's Fortune This delightful game combines classic platform adventure play with gorgeous graphics for a super-fun and absorbing experience. Once you've hunted down the thief that stole Leo's gold, you'll unlock a seriously addicting ""hard-core"" mode.

Get it for iOS and Android. 10. Lifeline This Choose Your Own Adventure-style game is the perfect alternative to fast-paced or mindless click-heavy apps. Get into the story and guide it with your choices for a super-engaging and more relaxed play experience.Get it for iOS and Android. 11. Magic Mansion This adorable game offers a major throwback to your old favourite Nintendo classics. Avoid traps and jump your way through the charming but challenging platform levels.Get it for iOS and Android. 12. (and its two subsequent iterations) is all you want from a locked-room puzzle. Turn keys, open mysterious boxes, and remember codes as you pass from one room to the next, all in search of the ~fifth element~.

(I've found that it's easier to play on a bigger screen - some clues require very specific tapping, which is hard on a phone screen.)

Get it for iOS here, for Android here, and on Steam here. 13. is a really charming puzzle game, not unlike Tetris. It has some lovely design touches and is a really calming experience to play.

Get it for iOS here and Android here. 14. Magic Piano by Smule This charming game is chill and consuming in one go. Think Guitar Hero but with piano and for your phone. Choose from a load of song options, from classics to current hits, and follow the dots to play along.

Get it for iOS and Android.

Recommended by delaynab. 15. is absurdly charming. It's a puzzle game handmade entirely from paper, card, miniature lights, and motors. You play as Lumi (that's her, on the left in both images), out to solve the mystery of her grandfather's disappearance. The puzzles are challenging but not fiendish.

(BTW Steam fans, you might have played Lume a few years back - is the sequel.) Get it for iOS here and for PC here. 16. Swoopy Space This adorable pixel game is the perfect time-waster. Manoeuvre ""space stuff"" to collect and avoid things and enjoy the cheery, mind-numbing escape only a simple, classic game can offer.

Get it for iOS. 17. is a 20 Questions genius: Whatever you're thinking about, he knows. Seriously. In all my years of playing it, the only thing I have managed to defeat it with is Wishbone the dog, from the TV series Wishbone.

Play it here. 18. Plague Inc. Plague Inc. isn't the App Store's top paid game for no reason. For just 79p, you get clever, engrossing, and endless fun in this apocalyptic strategy game. It's also perfect for when you hit your dealing-with-people limit for the week, since instead of saving humanity, you are the plague, out to destroy.

Get it for iOS and Android. 19. Orbit This puzzle slash gravity simulator is gorgeous and easy to get completely consumed in. Across 45 free levels, you launch planets and then work to keep them in their orbit and away from black holes. It's totally engrossing and so cool to watch. Get it for iOS and Android. 20. In October, BuzzFeed editors recommended their favourite games, and Natalie Brown's review got me hooked: ""The game is really a playable short story - which is why I love it so much, those are my favorite kind of games - where you slowly build your world, click by click on the desktop, tap by tap on your phone. You gather wood, you build a village, you take care of the people in your village. It sounds simple, but it's as addicting as Candy Crush.""

Get it for iOS or play in in a browser window here. 21. = Minecraft + Farmville + Zelda. There's a bit of backstory, but essentially you're building a village, stone by stone.

If you don't want to pay for buy-ins, the downside of is there's sections of dead time while you wait for things to sell or build. You'll also need an internet connection to play.

Get it for iOS here and Android here. 22. The New York Times Crossword Puzzle ""The big ones are very hard (and get increasingly harder),"" says Remee, ""but actually the mini and midi crosswords packs are really great (some packs are free some you have to buy). They are a good way to challenge yourself while on the tube, but also not hard enough so you feel like a dumbass! Always makes the commute go by really fast!""

Get it for iOS and Android. 23. Dashy the Cat This simple but addictive arcade-style game will have you sliding across shoots and down ladders to collect watermelon treats - just avoid the dead ends and spikes as levels get increasingly difficult!

Get it for iOS. 24. Final Taptasy So my partner recently spent at LEAST three full days trying to recalibrate his MacBook to support Final Fantasy because it makes him all nostalgic for his teen gaming days. My advice: Do not try to recalibrate your MacBook. Pick up this retro-style Final Fantasy-inspired pixel game instead.

Get it for iOS and Android. 25. New Star Cricket Patrick says: ""This is the fiendishly addictive follow-up to the BAFTA-winning New Star Soccer, which became a firm favourite among commuters and bored office workers the country over.

""It's firmly in the same fast-paced, cartoonish arcade style as its predecessor and is just as easy to pick up, with no knowledge of cricket really needed - this isn't one for purists. The elation of smacking the ball over the ropes for six is about equal to the frustration of getting out on your first ball.

""It's free to play, with a host of paid-for things available to buy to give your cricketer an extra edge - but you can just about get by without them.""

Get it for iOS. 26. Surfingers This adorable little game is a perfect way to pass the time. Drag the waves up and down with your fingers to keep your surfer afloat, and see how far you can go.

Get it for iOS and Android. 27. is one of my fave browser games: You are dropped into an unknown location on Google Maps and have to work out where you are. On a good day, there'll be a road sign you can work from. On a bad day, you'll find out that fields look broadly similar the world over.

Play it here. 28. is a nifty puzzle game with a 1960s spy theme (think Modesty Blaise). Some of the sections are challenging, especially if you're as bad at spatial puzzles as I am - but there's no shame in YouTubing a walkthrough. It's a little short, but a second adventure is due to be added.

Get it for iOS here. 29. is a locked-room murder mystery with a forensic twist. Written by David Varela (who was a writer for Sherlock), the storyline is tight and the clues are clever. Again, the only downside is that it's a little short.

Get it for iOS here and for Android here. Comment below with your favourite games for a chance to be featured in upcoming BuzzFeed posts!

2431644226,"When Octavia Spencer first read the script for Hidden Figures - based on a book about the African American women who did the math for our early space launches - she thought it was fiction because it seemed too good to be true. Her disbelief reveals how conditioned we are to think that only white men make notable contributions to science, technology, engineering and math - and how important it is that we celebrate stories of the women who do.

Big Hollywood movies based on true stories are an excellent way to do this. Narrative has a role to play as well, especially when it comes to another form of popular media: Romance novels, the second largest category of fiction in the U.S. Long derided as mere smut, these days romance novels feature heroines in the STEM fields - and the prejudices and obstacles they face on the way to a personal and professional happy ever after.

The romance in Courtney Milan's Hold Me is off to a rocky start when the hero, Jay na Thalang, assumes the heroine must be a lab supply salesperson when she shows up at his graduate studies lab. Not only is Maria Lopez a woman, she's a pretty, ""done up"" woman with an interest in shoes and planning her brother's wedding. She cannot possibly be smart enough to be worthy of his time and attention.

Article continues after sponsorship

But unbeknownst to both Jay and Maria, they are already friends online - or at least their avatars are. When they meet as just minds (enabling Jay to imagine that she is a frumpy, nerdy girl) they are friends and trusted confidants who discuss problems both scientific and, eventually, personal. As long as she isn't an undeniably sexy female body, Jay can respect her intelligence.

Much of the conflict between the hero and heroine in this book stems from the hero's assumptions about a woman's brains based merely on her appearance; what Jay comes to realize is that the problem lies with him.

Even Odds by Elia Winters continues with the theme of a woman's body getting in the way of her brain - not for her, but for the men in the room. Isabel Suarez, a design manager at a gaming firm, just wants to focus on the work. Whereas Maria flaunts her femininity, Isabel learned she must hide hers in order to succeed professionally, so she wears baggy clothes, pulls her hair back and smiles tightly when one coworker's comments make her uncomfortable:

"" His words were teasing, but Isabel bristled. This is what she'd wanted, though. It was better just to be sexless and professional, treated like another one of the guys, if she wanted to be taken seriously .""

Complications ensue when romance blossoms with her new coworker. Being open about their relationship means owning that she is more than just a sexless work automaton and opening herself up to judgment. Isabel only gets her happy ever after when she can allow both sides of herself to flourish - with the love and support of her enlightened hero (and an equally enlightened HR department).

In Beginner's Guide: Love And Other Chemical Reactions by Six de los Reyes, Kaya Rubio is happy being all brain: she lives and breathes her work as a molecular biologist and has optimized her life so she can focus on it completely. While the plot of her story is familiar - single girl seeks date for family wedding - the approach she takes is novel. When it comes to finding love, Kaya devises ""The Boyfriend Experiment"" which draws on scientific principles and peer reviewed papers.

Her hero is her negative control, a man so wrong he can't possibly be right. He introduces her to romance - spontaneous, messy, emotional, pleasurable, utterly confounding logic and reason - and to another side of her herself, showing that needn't sacrifice her heart for her brain.

Being romance novels, these stories do end happily: The heroines get to be brilliant and beautiful. They can be smart and sexy and loved for it. It's a message repeated in so many romances, whether these titles or my own historical novel, Lady Claire Is All That, which features a heroine based on Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer. Professional success doesn't have to come at the expense of personal happiness.

It's a message that matters, especially with regard to women and heroines in STEM. Those who develop technology we use are creating the world we live in, and having women build it is the best way to ensure that the sexism and misogyny that have held us back so far isn't baked into our future.

Stories have an important task to do here: They show all the different ways smart women can succeed personally and professionally, without having to hide their brains or their bodies in order to live happily ever after.

http://latiendadejm.com/blog/desde-el-eclipse-del-siglo-a-un-auto-para-batir-el-record-absoluto-de-velocidad-lo-que-traera-la-ciencia-en-2017/

Desde espectáculos naturales que prometen ser majestuosos a desarrollos tecnológicos de alto voltaje, aquí te presentamos una guía de los grandes eventos de la ciencia que veremos durante el año que comienza.
El eclipse del siglo
 Image copyright PA 
 Image caption Listos para mirar al cielo en agosto. 

Si los pronósticos astronómicos son acertados, 2017 nos ofrecerá lo que ha sido catalogado como ""el eclipse del siglo"".
En agosto, aficionados a las estrellas de todo el mundo tendrán la mirada puesta en Estados Unidos para este espectacular evento cósmico.
La anticipación es entendible: se trata del primer eclipse total de sol que se verá en territorio estadounidense desde 1949 y, lo que es aún más especial, el primer eclipse de costa a costa, desde el Océano Pacífico al Atlántico, desde 1918. 
A lo largo de una hora y media el 21 de agosto, la sombra de la Luna trazará un arco desde Oregón, en el oeste del país, diagonalmente hacia el sureste, hasta Carolina del Sur.
Y varias grandes ciudades, como San Luis en Misuri o Nashville, Tennessee, quedarán en el camino del eclipse.
No hay mucho más que la ciencia pueda avanzar en materia de eclipses, pero éste seguro aportará uno de los grandes espectáculos de la naturaleza de los que vayamos a tener memoria.

El señor de los anillos
En 2017, una de las misiones más exitosas de la NASA alcanzará su dramático final. La sonda Cassini-Huygens fue lanzada en 1997 y entró en la órbita de Saturno en 2004.

Así cubrimos la noticia en 2004 (página de archivo)

 Image caption La confirmación de que la sonda quedó atrapada en la órbita de Saturno, el planeta de los anillos, llegó en julio de 2004, para satisfacción del equipo de científicos tras la misión. 

La lista de descubrimientos y detalles recogidos por la misión es asombrosa: desde los huracanes gigantes en los polos del planeta de los anillos a los géiseres en erupción en la helada luna Encélado o las lluvias, ríos y mares en el mayor satélite del planeta, Titán.

El océano gigantesco escondido dentro de Encélado
Los sonidos que se producen atravesando la atmósfera de Titán

Pero habrá más: durante 2017, Cassini llevará a cabo más de 20 incursiones en el cordón exterior del imponente sistema de anillos que rodea Saturno.
Esto dará a los científicos una oportunidad sin precedentes para estudiar en detalle los anillos.
""Tenemos dos instrumentos que pueden tomar muestras de partículas y gases a medida que cruzamos el plano de los anillos, así que en cierta medida Cassini también está 'pastando' sobre ellos"", indicó Linda Spilker, científica del proyecto.
Los expertos también podrán observar el conjunto de pequeñas lunas que orbitan en o cerca de los bordes de los anillos.
En abril, Cassini comenzará inmersiones repetidas a través de la estrecha brecha que existe entre Saturno y sus anillos.
Finalmente, el 15 de septiembre, la sonda pondrá fin a su misión al sumergirse en la atmósfera de Saturno: una ""muerte"" diseñada para evitar que se estrelle contra lunas potencialmente habitables y las contamine con cualquier organismo de la Tierra que haya podido colarse a bordo al inicio de su viaje cósmico.
Rápido y furioso
El proyecto Bloodhound tiene una primera misión, la de romper la marca actual de velocidad en tierra de 1.228 km/h con un auto que tiene un cohete entre sus sistemas de propulsión.

Bloodhound: así es el auto más rápido que un avión de combate

 Image copyright BLOODHOUND SSC 
 Image caption Un auto que es parte avión de combate con motor a reacción, parte auto de Fórmula 1 y parte cohete espacial. 

El proyecto, de origen británico, ya ha sufrido varios retrasos, pero el equipo responsable confía en que el 2017 será su año de suerte.
La mayor parte de la estructura del vehículo ya está lista y, más recientemente, el equipo ha puesto a prueba el sistema de abastecimiento de combustible.
Impulsado por un cohete atornillado a un motor a reacción de un avión de combate Eurofighter-Typhoon, el auto debe ser sometido a pruebas en el aeropuerto de Newquay, en Reino Unido, en julio. Y luego en Hakskeen Pan, Sudáfrica, durante la segunda mitad del año.
El objetivo es acelerarlo hasta los 1.287 km/h (800 millas por hora) para reescribir el récord de velocidad antes de que el año culmine.
Luego, después de una pausa, el carro debería regresar a Sudáfrica en 2018 para alcanzar su misión última: romper la marca de las mil millas por hora (1.600 km/h).

¿Será éste el año en que SpaceX, del empresario tecnológico Elon Musk, lance su cohete Falcon Heavy?

Así es la nave con la que SpaceX quiere que viajemos a Marte a establecer una colonia

El lanzador súper pesado fue mencionado por primera vez en 2005, pero la fecha para su vuelo inaugural ha sido reprogramada varias veces, la última debido a la explosión del cohete más pequeño de SpaceX, el Falcon 9, en septiembre pasado.

La dramática explosión del cohete Falcon 9 de SpaceX

Mientras que la compañía de Musk trabaja para hacer funcionar ese cohete en 2017, es posible que veamos también el lanzamiento de su primo más poderoso, el Heavy, durante el año que comienza.
El cohete, que en realidad consta de tres impulsores de Falcon 9 combinados, está diseñado para poner en órbita cargas pesadas, incluidos ​​satélites comerciales y militares y quizá, algún día, una nave espacial tripulada. 
Pero los repetidos retrasos han llevado a algunos clientes comerciales de SpaceX a buscar otras alternativas para los lanzamientos de satélites programados en los próximos años.
El lanzamiento de prueba podría hacerse desde la base de la fuerza aérea de Vandenberg, California, o desde el Centro Espacial Kennedy, en Florida.
Hay tanto en juego que SpaceX bien podría posponer nuevamente el lanzamiento. Pero, si tenemos suerte, podríamos ver el espectáculo de la salida al espacio de este monstruo de 70 metros de altura en algún momento de 2017.

2431649530,"Craig Sager accepts the Jimmy V Award for perseverance during the 2016 ESPYS in July. (Kevin Winter/) Happy New Year to you all! With one final look back on 2016, it's worth remembering that outside of politics people do extraordinary, important things. Here are some non-political distinguished persons of 2016: 1. . Superb performance by Simone Biles, Allyson Felix, Katie Ledecky and others inspired and amazed us. Just how dominate were they? They won 61 medals, including 27 gold. Their extraordinary showing prompted us to take a look back at a government initiative that has paid off handsomely - Title IX.

2. Katherine Johnson. The African American mathematician and NASA trailblazer finally got her due - the Medal of Freedom and a movie, ""Hidden Figures,"" which told her story and that of two other women who played a central part in the space program. If you want a lesson in perseverance, you won't find one better than hers.

3. Lin-Manuel Miranda. His Web site reads:

Lin-Manuel Miranda is an award-winning composer, lyricist, and performer, as well as a 2015 MacArthur Foundation Award recipient. His current musical, Hamilton - with book, music and lyrics by Mr. Miranda, in addition to him originating the title role - opened on Broadway in 2015. Hamilton was awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Drama and earned a record-breaking 16 Tony Nominations, winning 11 Tony Awards including two personally for Mr. Miranda for Book and Score of a Musical. The Original Broadway Cast Recording of Hamilton won the 2016 Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album. Both Mr. Miranda and Hamilton won the 2016 Drama League Awards for Distinguished Performance and Outstanding Production of a Musical, respectively. He also probably . More important, he introduced millions to Hamilton's story and, more generally, to the history of America's founding. His work is among the greatest teaching successes in decades.

4. Lonnie Bunch. The director of the opened his masterpiece to the public, and it has become the hottest ticket in town. (Advanced tickets are sold out through April, daily tickets can be purchased online now.) As a museum it is a stunning accomplishment, one more contribution to the study of American history. The opening ceremony provided an uplifting moment of unity at a time the country is so badly divided and so angry.

5. Craig Sager. The much beloved sideline basketball reporter, renowned for his psychedelic jackets, passed away after a 2½ year battle with cancer. He received the ""Jimmy V"" award and delivered a memorable, uplifting speech. He exemplified the best in sports - courage, joy and humility. ""I will continue to keep fighting, sucking the marrow out of life as life sucks the marrow out of me,"" he said. That's fine advice for everyone.

American Revolution Bicentennial Standards Manual

In 1974 Bruce Blackburn designed a red-white-and-blue, star-shaped wheel logo. The icon was for the upcoming United States Bicentennial, and the idea was that the symbol would appear across all manner of celebratory materials, from postage stamps to buildings. To ensure his logo looked its best in any situation, Blackburn published a set of visual guidelines. This year, Standards Manuals-the same folks who reprinted the MTA and NASA manuals -revived Blackburn's original ( $45 ).

This Brutal World

For years, the Brutalist style of architecture was despised. Now, it's experiencing a comeback, thanks in no small part to Peter Chadwick. Two years ago the London art director started tweeting out photos of forgotten Brutalist buildings. Today, he's the author of This Brutal World ( $50 ), a handsome coffee table book from Phaidon that's dedicated to the raw, concrete style of architecture. The tome highlights recent work, as well as older buildings that have since been demolished. In that sense, the book doubles as a form of preservation.

Les Diners de Gala

Salvador Dalí produced many masterpieces in his life, and one of them was a cookbook. Les Diners de Gala was semi-autobiographical, based on the lavish dinner parties of Dalí and his wife, Gala. This year Taschen reprinted the book ( $60 ), which originally came out in 1973. You might not actually attempt any of the 136 recipes (do you really want ""Thousand year old eggs""?), but you'll certainly feast on the surreal paintings and collages that fill the book.

Failed It!

Failed It! ( $13) is equal parts platitudes and botched photographs. The platitudes are nothing new-for decades, quotable politicians, scientists, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have touted the virtues of failure. The pictures in Failed It! , on the other hand, feel novel. Or maybe they won't: many of them resemble amateur, flubbed 35 millimeter prints, like the outtakes from a roll of family vacation photos. Most people would regard these oddly exposed, finger-over-the-lens shots as trash. Artist Erik Kessels, who authored Failed It! , prizes them.

The Earth and I

Some years ago, the renowned scientist James Lovelock got the idea for a book. It would be ""the scientific equivalent of the Bible,"" he said, and would read like a how-to manual for humans to rebuild the world, in the event of a mass catastrophe. The Earth and I ( $30 ), which Lovelock co-authored, is not that book-but there are traces of it present. The book is an information-rich account of how the earth came to be, how it behaves, and how we humans impact it. A prestigious list of scientists, including Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, contributed chapters. The art in the book is especially noteworthy: illustrator Jack Hudson created it, and though he favors a cheerful, mid-century style, his work for The Earth and I is scientifically rigorous. Understanding the workings of the planet has never looked better.

The World of Charles and Ray Eames

Charles and Ray Eames designed several iconic chairs, but their contributions to design-and, really, to society-go far deeper than furniture. During World War II, the husband-and-wife team pioneered advances in materials. They reimagined the office space entirely. They walked the walk, too, by building their home in the image of their modern ideas about design. The World of Charles and Ray Eames ( $45 ) is a monograph filled with images and tales from all these projects, and more.

Pretty Much Everything

You know Aaron Draplin's work even if you don't know the man. The Oregon designer has created identities for Nike and Patagonia, and launched the popular Field Notes notebooks. Draplin favors a pared down approach to design-you won't find any pretentious essays about logo design from him. Instead, this year, Draplin pulled back the curtain on his process by releasing Pretty Much Everything ( $27 ). The book contains, you know, pretty much everything that informs his work: artifacts, posters, travelogues, case studies, and more.

Sunday Sketching

For years, illustrator Christoph Niemann (whose work you'll find in publications like New York Times Magazine , the New Yorker , and WIRED) would spend his Sundays engaged in a drawing exercise. He'd sit down with a sheet of paper and a random object, then find ways to incorporate the item into a drawing. In this way, bottles of ink became cameras, highlighters became light sabers, and pennies became scoops of ice cream. You'll find many of Niemann's visual puns in his new monograph, Sunday Sketching ( $34 ) , interspersed with the illustrator's compellingly honest musings on the creative process.

2431651869,"A smart speaker may not always be the best fit with your home decor. There are some things you can do to try to disguise it , but if you can't find the counter space or a spot on a bookshelf that you like for it, an alternative might be to bolt it directly to the wall.

With dozens of aftermarket options for wall- or ceiling-mounting your Alexa speaker, there's no shortage of ways to get your Amazon Echo up off the shelf and out into the open.

What you will need

Much like TV wall-mount kits, most mounting kits for the Echo and Echo Dot come with all the hardware you need to install them. Choosing one really comes down to personal preference in design -- how tightly to the wall the speaker is fixed, how the bracket itself looks and what materials it's made of.

Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET

I chose the HideIt Echo Wall Mount as the mount itself is discreet. Other models aren't limited to just holding the Echo, however. They can also hold other cylindrical speakers, such as the UE Boom .

Other than the mounting hardware that comes included, you will need only a few tools:

An electric drill with various drill bits A level A pencil

If you want to attach the speaker mount to a stud for extra security, you'll also need a stud finder.

How to mount your Amazon Echo to the wall

Start by finding an appropriate location for your Echo. Remember that a centralized location is best and it will be more difficult to relocate it once it's in place. So make certain you know where you want to mount it before you begin drilling.

Also consider that mounting the Echo to the wall goes against the recommended use . Amazon suggests keeping the speaker about 8 inches from any wall. Mounting it, obviously, will keep the Echo permanently 2 inches or less from the wall, which might make it harder for Alexa to hear you.

Be sure to first have someone hold the speaker in the bracket where you want to mount it to the wall and test its responsiveness from several spots around the room.

Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET

Once you've picked the perfect spot:

Hold the empty bracket up to the wall in the position you want to mount it. Use a level to ensure the bracket is straight. Use a pencil to mark the position of the drill holes. If you're mounting the bracket to sheetrock: Remove the bracket from the wall and, using the recommended drill bit size for your mount kit, drill a pilot hole into the sheetrock at each marked spot. Push the sheetrock anchor into each hole. If you're mounting directly to a stud, drilling pilot holes isn't necessary. Line up the bracket on the wall with the sheetrock anchors or drill marks and, using a drill, screw the included screws into the sheetrock anchors or the marked spots.

Your Echo should slide right into the bracket. Plug it in, let it boot and you can resume using it how you're used to.

With the Echo up off a counter top or table, it will be more difficult for obstructions (other than the wall, of course) to pile up around it. It also means you can get a little more creative with where you put the Echo in your home. You can position it between two common areas and, potentially, double its range or usefulness.

Best of all, it can serve as a sort of showcase for one of the coolest gadgets in your home. That said, you may have to find a clever way to hide the power cable.

"
2431653109,"In a lab buried under the Apennine Mountains of Italy, Elena Aprile , a professor of physics at Columbia University, is racing to unearth what would be one of the biggest discoveries in physics.

She has not yet succeeded, even after more than a decade of work. Then again, nobody else has, either.

Quanta Magazine

About

Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent division of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences

Aprile leads the XENON dark matter experiment, one of several competing efforts to detect a particle responsible for the astrophysical peculiarities that are collectively attributed to dark matter. These include stars that rotate around the cores of galaxies as if pulled by invisible mass, excessive warping of space around large galaxy clusters, and the leopard-print pattern of hot and cold spots in the early universe.

For decades, the most popular explanation for such phenomena was that dark matter is made of as-yet undiscovered weakly interacting massive particles, known as WIMPs. These WIMPs would only rarely leave an imprint on the more familiar everyday matter.

That paradigm has recently been under fire. The Large Hadron Collider located at the CERN laboratory near Geneva has not yet found anything to support the existence of WIMPs. Other particles , less studied, could also do the trick. Dark matter's astrophysical effects might even be caused by modifications of gravity , with no need for the missing stuff at all.

The most stringent WIMP searches have been done using Aprile's strategy: Pour plenty of liquid xenon-a noble element like helium or neon, but heavier-into a vat. Shield it from cosmic rays, which would inundate the detector with spurious signals. Then wait for a passing WIMP to bang into a xenon atom's nucleus. Once it does, capture out the tiny flash of light that should result.

The time projection chamber at the heart of the detector is filled with 3.5 metric tons of liquid xenon. The XENON Experiment

These experiments use progressively larger tanks of liquid xenon that the researchers believe should be able to catch the occasional passing WIMP. Each successive search without a discovery shows that WIMPs, if they exist, must be lighter or less prone to leave a mark on normal matter than had been assumed.

In recent years, Aprile's team has vied with two close competitors for the title of Most-thorough WIMP Search: LUX, the Large Underground Xenon experiment, a U.S.-based group that split from her team in 2007, and PandaX, the Particle and Astrophysical Xenon experiment, a Chinese group that broke away in 2009. Both collaborators-turned-rivals also use liquid-xenon detectors and similar technology. Soon, though, Aprile expects her team to be firmly on top: The third-generation XENON experiment-larger than before, with three and a half metric tons of xenon to catch passing WIMPs-has been running since the spring, and is now taking data. A final upgrade is planned for the early 2020s.

The game can't go on forever, though. The scientists will eventually hit astrophysical bedrock: The experiments will become sensitive enough to pick up neutrinos from space, flooding the particle detectors with noise. If WIMPs haven't been detected by that point, Aprile plans to stop and rethink where else to look.

Aprile splits her time between her native Italy and New York City, where in 1986 she became the first female professor of physics at Columbia University. Quanta caught up with her on a Saturday morning in her Brooklyn high-rise apartment that faces toward the Statue of Liberty. An edited and condensed version of the interview follows.

QUANTA MAGAZINE: How closely do you follow the theoretical back and forth about the nature of dark matter?

ELENA APRILE: For me, driving the technology, driving the detector, making it the best detector is what makes it exciting. The point right now is that in a couple of years, maybe four or five in total, we will definitely say there is no WIMP or we will discover something.

I don't care much about what the theorists say. I go on with my experiment. The idea of the WIMP is clearly today still quite ideal. Nobody could tell you ""No, you're crazy looking for a WIMP.""

Ben Sklar for Quanta Magazine

What do you imagine will happen over the next few years in this search?

If we find a signal, we have to go even faster and build a larger scale detector which we are planning already-in order to have a chance to see more of them, and have a chance to build up the statistics. If we see nothing after a year or two, the same story.

The plan for the collaboration, for me and how I drive these 130 people, is very clear for the next four or five years. But beyond that, we will go almost to the level that we start really to see neutrinos. If we end up being lucky-if a supernova goes off next to us and we see neutrinos-we will not have found dark matter, but still detect something very exciting.

How did you get started with this xenon detector technology?

I started my career as a summer student at CERN. Carlo Rubbia was a professor at Harvard and also a physicist at CERN. He proposed a liquid-argon TPC-time projection chamber. This was hugely exciting as a detector because you can measure precisely the energy of a particle, and you can measure the location of the interaction, and you can do tracking. So, that was my first experience, to build the first liquid-argon 'baby' detector-1977, yes, that's when it started. And then I went to Harvard, and I did my early work with Rubbia on liquid argon. That was the seed that led eventually to the monstrous, huge liquid-argon detector called ICARUS.

Later, I left Rubbia and I accepted the position of assistant professor here at Columbia. I got interested in continuing with liquid-argon detectors, but for neutrino detection from submarines. I got my first grant from DARPA [the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]. They didn't give a damn about supernova neutrinos, but they wanted to see neutrinos from the [nuclear] Russian submarines. And then we had Supernova 1987A, and I made a proposal to fly a liquid-argon telescope on a high-altitude balloon to detect the gamma rays from this supernova.

I studied a lot-the properties of argon, krypton, xenon-and then it became clear that xenon is a much more promising material for gamma-ray detection. So I turned my attention to liquid xenon for gamma-ray astrophysics.

[embedded content]

How did that swerve into a search for dark matter?

I had this idea that this detector I built for gamma-ray astrophysics could have been, in another version, ideal to look for dark matter. I said to myself: ""Maybe it's worth going into this field. The question is hot, and maybe we have the right tool to finally make some progress.""

It's atypical that the NSF [National Science Foundation], for someone new like me, will fund the proposal right away. It was the strength of what I had done all those years with the a liquid-xenon TPC for gamma-ray astrophysics. They realized that this woman can do it. Not because I'm very bold and I proposed a very aggressive program-which of course is typical of me-but I think it was the work that we did for another purpose which gave the strength to the XENON program, which I proposed in 2001 to the NSF.

What was it like to go from launching high-altitude balloons to working underground?

We had quite a few balloon campaigns. It's something that I would do again, and I didn't appreciate it then. You get your detector ready, you sit it on this gondola. At some point you are ready, but you can't do anything because every morning you go and you wait for the weather guy to tell you if it's the right moment to fly. In that scenario you are a slave to something bigger than you, which you can't do anything about. You go on the launch pad, you look at the guy measuring, checking everything, and he says ""No.""

Underground, I guess, there is no such major thing holding you from operating your detector. But there are still, in the back of your mind, thoughts about the seismic resilience of what you designed and what you built.

In a 2011 interview with The New York Times about women at the top of their scientific fields, you described the life of a scientist as tough, competitive and constantly exposed. You suggested that if one of your daughters aspired to be a scientist you would want her to be made of titanium. What did you mean by that?

Maybe I shouldn't demand this of every woman in science or physics. It's true that it might not be fair to ask that everyone is made of titanium. But we must face it-in building or running this new experiment-there is going to be a lot of pressure sometimes. It's on every student, every postdoc, every one of us: Try to go fast and get the results, and work day and night if you want to get there. You can go on medical leave or disability, but the WIMP is not waiting for you. Somebody else is going to get it, right? This is what I mean when I say you have to be strong.

Going after something like this, it's not a 9-to-5 job. I wouldn't discourage anyone at the beginning to try. But then once you start, you cannot just pretend that this is just a normal job. This is not a normal job. It's not a job. It's a quest.

Aprile in her lab at Columbia's Nevis Laboratories. Ben Sklar for Quanta Magazine

In another interview, with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , you discussed having a brilliant but demanding mentor in Carlo Rubbia, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1984. What was that relationship like?

It made me of titanium, probably. You have to imagine this 23-year-old young woman from Italy ending up at CERN as a summer student in the group of this guy. Even today, I would still be scared if I were that person. Carlo exudes confidence. I was just intimidated.

He would keep pushing you beyond the state that is even possible: ""It's all about the science; it's all about the goal. How the hell you get there I don't care: If you're not sleeping, if you're not eating, if you don't have time to sleep with your husband for a month, who cares? You have a baby to feed? Find some way."" Since I survived that period I knew that I was made a bit of titanium, let's put it that way. I did learn to contain my tears. This is a person you don't want to show weakness to.

Now, 30 years after going off to start your own lab, how does the experience of having worked with him inform the scientist you are today, the leader of XENON?

For a long time, he was still involved in his liquid-argon effort. He would still tell me, ""What are you doing with xenon; you have to turn to argon."" It has taken me many years to get over this Rubbia fear, for many reasons, probably-even if I don't admit it. But now I feel very strong. I can face him and say: ""Hey, your liquid-argon detector isn't working. Mine is working.""

I decided I want to be a more practical person. Most guys are naive. All these guys are naive. A lot of things he did and does are exceptional, yes, but building a successful experiment is not something you do alone. This is a team effort and you must be able to work well with your team. Alone, I wouldn't get anywhere. Everybody counts. It doesn't matter that we build a beautiful machine: I don't believe in machines. We are going to get this damn thing out of it. We're going to get the most out of the thing that we built with our brains, with the brains of our students and postdocs who really look at this data. We want to respect each one of them.

2016 was the year that consumer-grade VR went from something most of us just read about to something that started appearing in stores and homes. In the past, articles about VR proclaimed, ""You can't convey the effect on a flat screen, you'll have to trust us!"" and ""It's magical, we promise!"" But the praise was impossible to verify since you probably couldn't stick your own eyes into a pair of pricey goggles. Even as one of VR's biggest early fans, I empathize with that caged-hype feeling. Enough! Let's see how this stuff actually plays out.

Quality consumer-grade VR systems are finally landing in significant numbers, right next to amusement-park rigs, free store demos, and even half-decent smartphone rigs (from Google Daydream to a newer, slightly sharper Samsung GearVR). Enough VR content came out this year to merit a full-blown best-of report for 2016. Because the industry is still nascent, I'm skipping the list format and opting to break this up into a few sections-including projections about what to expect from VR in 2017.

Best current system? [embedded content] Ars compares the major VR systems.

We've already written a few guides comparing the ""big three"" VR systems -as in, the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR. (That designation comes from how all three are powerful enough to render ""real"" VR content, complete with comfortable head tracking, and all three ship with solid controllers.) Ars has yet to declare a winner in the VR race, and I'm not going to alter that call.

Each system has its advantages. PlayStation VR may offer the best bang for the buck, especially if you already own a standard PlayStation 4 console. (In a pinch, you can forgo the PlayStation Move motion wands, as many of its best games don't require the wands.) PSVR's tracking can be very wonky, whether because of lighting or because of a random, full-system desync. But its headset is possibly the most comfortable of the three, and it's the friendliest to anybody who wears glasses, no question.

The biggest issue: PSVR's tracking stability degrades significantly when you stand up, which is where the other two expensive options take a lead.

First-gen Oculus Rifts and HTC Vives have their own issues, and in our dream world, we'd get a set that combines the best of both. The Rift has a comfier headset; its integrated headphones are dynamite; and its (optional) motion-tracked Touch controllers feel better than the Vive's wands. However, the Vive's tracking boxes are superior both for how well they track a user in real-life space and for not requiring a direct USB connection to your computer. Also, Vive's games are all built with a motion tracking expectation, and its screen is a teensy bit clearer.

Click here for a longer hardware comparison, which talks at length about each system's setup process, among other factors.

Guns up

Gunplay dominated VR's first official year, mostly for practical reasons. Primarily, developers for Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR made games with an expectation of seated players and gamepads, which meant cockpits, cockpits, cockpits. On the Vive side, the system's default wands are meant to replicate hands. But with a headset on, Vive's handle-and-trigger setup pretty much feels like guns.

Enlarge / Of the notable games in the Rift's 30-strong launch library, the high-octane online space shooter Eve Valkyrie comes closest to a killer app. Tracking the enemy with your head at 360 degrees is a game-changer in the truest sense of the word.

Eve Valkyrie wins out as the year's best sit-down cockpit shooter in VR, both because it's damned good and because you can buy it for all three systems. This space-deathmatch shooter doesn't offer much depth, but its mix of slick interface, comfortable play, and bombastic combat make it an obvious leader in the ""I want VR to feel awesome and simple immediately"" department. Honorable mention goes to a special X-Wing mission on PSVR, free to owners of Star Wars: Battlefield on PS4. It's short but oh-so-sweet, and it makes us hopeful that EA will squeeze out a fully fledged VR game while it still has Star Wars' gaming rights.

[embedded content] Space Pirate Trainer official trailer.

The stand-and-shoot VR genre, meanwhile, has a whopping four top contenders. (Seriously. So many guns this year.) The first, Space Pirate Trainer (Vive, Oculus Touch), is the best among a huge field of similar arcadey games in which players obliterate waves of computer-controlled enemies with a variety of guns. SPT launched as a sublimely tuned rush of high-speed action, particularly with its bullet-time ""you're about to die"" moments. The game has only gotten better after a series of patches and the addition of weapons like a grenade launcher, an electric whip, and a scatter-happy shotgun. The sound design, the enemy patterns, the responsiveness of each weapon-no other VR arcade-shooter comes close.

[embedded content] Superhot VR launch trailer.

Next is Superhot VR , which is currently an Oculus Touch exclusive. What was already a thrill as a standard keyboard-and-mouse affair becomes a sense-overloading masterwork in VR and one of the best honest-to-goodness ""full VR games"" this year (as opposed to so many quick-burst arcade experiments). Kyle Orland's year-end blurb about Superhot VR has more info about the game's ""time moves only when you move"" gimmick.

[embedded content] How to play Hover Junkers.

My other two stand-and-shooter picks are online multiplayer games. Hover Junkers (Vive) wins out in spite of user-unfriendliness. New players don't get coaxed with a tutorial or a mission that naturally introduces HJ 's disparate systems-shooting guns, picking loadouts, driving a floating tank platform, and using scrap to build defensive cover. Its sheer physicality is also daunting; no VR game on any platform requires this much real-life movement. But ye holy gods, man. Once you know Hover Junkers ' ins and outs, you're in for one of the most thrilling deathmatch experiences ever made (which has only gotten better thanks to an ever-increasing selection of guns over the past few months). Building, driving, and duck-and-covering around your own ramshackle hovertank truly works, thanks to surprisingly reliable netcode performance.

[embedded content] Rec Room beta trailer.

The only multiplayer shooter to compare this year is Rec Room (Vive, Oculus Touch), which is still, for some insane reason, completely and totally free. After landing in a neighborhood recreation center with an automatically generated instance of other online players, you can either pick from a few hardcoded multiplayer games (paintball deathmatch, racquetball, ""3D charades"") or just goof off with games like basketball and table tennis. (This is similar to the game Destiny 's lobbies, but Rec Room 's lobbies actually have fun things to do .) Rec Room 's paintball mode is fun because it allows teams of players to VR-teleport around giant deathmatch arenas and blast each other while picking up new weapons on the ground.

Paintballin' in Rec Room . Use a paint gun to draw mid-air objects in the game's online charades game. Disc golf in Rec Room .

Rec Room is clearly still in tuning mode, with things like ammo regeneration, object physics, and teleportation delays constantly in flux. But its fun factor and player population are currently high and easily recommended, especially with its incredibly low learning curve.

New genres in VR

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: hand-tracking is probably the most interesting thing about VR, compared to the ""wow!"" factor of feeling like you're somewhere else. Standing super-close to a giant whale is cool for a second. But using your hands, as opposed to a joystick or mouse, to wave at that whale? That's the shizz, dogg.

[embedded content] Fantastic Contraption launch trailer.

That's probably why Fantastic Contraption (Vive, Oculus Touch, coming to PSVR) remains in my personal year-end list, even though the game is admittedly limited. Contraption , like its Flash predecessor, asks players to guide a little pink blob to a specific point in VR space by making wheel-driven machines. The solutions to these VR puzzles rarely feel perfectly crafted; instead, there's a trial-and-error wonkiness that leads either to too-simple or too-complicated solutions.

But no savvy computer user-specifically those interested in interface design-should leave 2016 without experiencing what it's like to generate, grab, manipulate, and combine objects inside of Fantastic Contraption . Its handheld controls reduce the complications and shortcut keys of mouse-and-keyboard rigs in amazingly elegant fashion, particularly in terms of letting users comfortably play within the Z axis. After a single session of Fantastic Contraption , you may find yourself imagining an operating system that works this way-and you will enjoy some truly unique puzzle moments, to boot.

[embedded content] I Expect You To Die launch trailer.

The puzzle game I Expect You To Die (Oculus Touch, PSVR) is similarly clever because it asks users to manipulate objects in a seated vicinity quickly and in rapid succession. Some of its puzzles could be done with a mouse, but many of them require three-axis manipulation, so it's nice to see the smoothness of hand controls so cleverly executed here. I Expect You to Die is a short-and-sweet puzzle affair with a healthy dollop of dark, James Bond-themed humor.

[embedded content] Accounting launch trailer

Barely sneaking into my personal VR top ten list: Accounting (Vive), the bizarre VR debut from Justin Roiland ( Rick and Morty ) and William Pugh ( The Stanley Parable ). Anyone familiar with those guys' creative output will be delighted by the weirdness they cooked up together, and its low price of $0 helps the brief, hilarious game go down a little smoother. VR is awash in humorous experiences, and I think that's because using your hands changes the reason things are funny. Job Simulator (Vive, Oculus Touch, PSVR) kicked this trend off, and it's quite clever, but I think Accounting is a more successful (and adventurous) take on the same idea.

[embedded content] SuperHyperCube launch trailer.

As much as I love tracked hand controllers, I was delighted by two trippy gamepad VR games that are currently PlayStation VR exclusives: Rez Infinite and SuperHyperCube . I've written at length about the former (TL;DR: I cried , and while my tears have since dried up, my enthusiasm hasn't). Meanwhile, I've taken to playing SuperHyperCube pretty much every night since it came out. It's not quite as breezy as grabbing a Game Boy and playing Tetris before bed, but slipping the PSVR headset on is easy, which helps me quickly get into and out of this gorgeously designed, deceptively simple spatial-awareness puzzle game.

Reducing SuperHyperCube to ""the Hole In The Wall game show in VR"" misses the whole point. Great design and aesthetics lift this game's simple premise to celestial heights-and will absolutely tick your ""just one more try"" box.

The winner is... Google? Sam Machkovech draws a bicycle in 3D using Tilt Brush . Kyle Orland Crazy 3D dragon, courtesy of Tilt Brush . Monster. Volcano. This image best shows off how mirror mode works, which allowed this artist to plot out a symmetrical series of lines around his trippy creation.

Pre-release preview events and ""wow it's finally here"" bluster have faded into memory, and for some VR games and apps, that period of time hasn't been kind. Google's Tilt Brush , on the other hand, has held up in the months since the hype faded. It is, without a doubt, my VR release of the year. One thing that has helped: Tilt Brush has received the most post-launch updates of any game or app on any VR platform.

Thanks to the updates, my launch-week impressions now sound dated. For starters, VR painters can now teleport around their 3D canvases. This means anybody can paint-sculpt decent, basic creations in small rooms, but things get crazier when you teleport long distances to create sweeping worlds; a pre-installed, dimensionally tricky Doctor Strange diorama uses this to great effect.

There have also been new brushes (and the ability to sync your strokes to music), but this month's new perk is possibly the best yet: cube and sphere templates. Now you can generate invisible shapes, then place your paintbrush on their edges or their insides and fill them in with whatever strokes, colors, and effects you want. The app's lack of default geometrical shapes or clay/putty substances forces some creative solutions to making 3D forms, but being able to generate circular and spherical forms on the fly fills the app's only remaining content gap.

I can go on and on about why I love Tilt Brush . (I already did that in April, and I encourage you to read that article again if you still need convincing.) I have similar praise to offer for Google Earth VR , which I still contend is a must-try for anybody's first time using the HTC Vive . The funny thing is, Google developed both of these experiences-and neither works in Google's proprietary Daydream VR rig. They're still both Vive exclusives. Could that change in 2017?

(Virtually) see you next year

VR's first major commercial year turned out well, all things considered. Even PlayStation VR's relatively lower cost is still pretty high, let alone the $1,000-plus required to dive into Oculus or Vive gaming. Yet public enthusiasm (and money) did prop the small industry up to some extent, with HTC in particular doing so well with its Vive system that it spun off the Vive division into its own company (so as not to saddle Vive's success with HTC's other failures).

But what should we expect next year from these three systems? In PlayStation VR's case, more games are already announced and in the pipeline. StarBlood Arena and Dino Frontier impressed me at December's PlayStation Experience, while we're hoping that a Psychonauts VR spinoff and the all-new puzzle game Statik Institute of Retention prove as compelling as their teaser demos felt earlier this year.

PSVR will also get an exclusive 2017 shooter called Farpoint , but that requires another proprietary purchase in the form of a giant plastic gun. The gun is fun but, geez, Sony. More troubling is the lack of triple-A Sony franchises attached to PSVR at this point. Even PlayStation Vita announced LittleBigPlanet and WipEout at an equivalent point in its history, and we know how unceremoniously that console got dropped. Sony needs to assure VR buyers that they won't get dropped like a sack of hot Vita-tatoes. So far, they're not doing a great job of that.

HTC clearly isn't backing down from the VR world, and a late-2016 Steam developer conference included a sneak peek at an updated SteamVR controller, complete with an Oculus Touch-like clasp over the hands. Smart money is on a refreshed HTC Vive model coming at some point in the year. We're thinking more evolution than revolution. New controllers and a more comfortable headset will certainly debut in a Vive 2.0, while fancier upgrades such as screen resolution and wireless protocols might be another year out in order to keep the 2017 kit at a low price. Ultimately, any Vive changes this year probably won't break compatibility with the original system.

The Vive will continue relying on small indie teams to generate VR content-unless Valve finally gets around to announcing a new VR-compatible game. If a giant price cut or rush of public interest doesn't hit the platform soon, however, that could be very bad news for VR gamers. Dean Hall, the DayZ creator who went on to form a VR studio, has made recent statements suggesting that VR game and app development is currently an easy way to lose money . All eyes will track the best-looking HTC Vive game in the works right now, Budget Cuts , when it (hopefully) launches in 2017; if that incredible "" Metal Gear Solid in VR"" adventure can't sell units, then I'm not sure what else could.

Oculus already has a comfy headset and pair of controllers in place, so I see the company pushing a serious price cut by the middle of 2017 for a complete Oculus hardware bundle. After that, we might see real traction on the company's announced plans for a wireless, all-in-one headset that has functional ""inside-out tracking."" The tech wasn't quite ready for prime time late this year, but who knows what difference a year will make? Oculus blew an opportunity to announce a bunch of 2017 games at its recent Oculus Connect conference, however, so I hope they make a splash at March's Game Developers Conference with a few bonafide ""big"" games. Additionally, I believe the Facebook VR demo from Oculus Connect will make its public debut by 2017's end. Even if Facebook VR turns out to be dorky or limited, the product will get the mainstream world hyped about VR all over again.

Both PC VR companies will continue pushing for efficient 3D rendering techniques , which will effectively lower the required computer power needed to join in the VR fun. In the short term, that'll make it easier for people to buy cheaper VR-ready PCs (or get their current PCs plugged into systems).

One more hulking beast still lurks on the horizon: Microsoft. The company will be pushing its Windows Holographic standard throughout 2017, which is designed to play nice with both virtual reality and ""augmented"" or ""mixed"" reality headsets (like its super-pricey Hololens). Additionally, Microsoft has announced a wave of Windows 10-compatible headsets set to launch this year, made by OEMs such as Dell and HP with prices as low as $299. These headsets appear to have incredibly low system spec requirements .

Ultimately, the future for consumer-grade VR will be busy, if not necessarily rosy. Price cuts need to land across the board, and ""full games"" need to start landing on the systems' marketplaces, or else the year that VR exploded will quite possibly be followed by the year that VR died.

Lexi Pandell Science Date of Publication: 01.01.17. 01.01.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The Science Behind Explosive Hangover Poops Apple Ah, the New Year. A time for resolutions, for self-betterment, for dumping out the old and bringing in the new. Unfortunately, if you celebrate New Year's Eve with champagne and shots, chances are you may spend the first day of the new year on the toilet. Scientists don't entirely understand what causes hangovers, but every over-imbiber knows its effects: puffy skin, headaches, nausea, the feeling when you drink water that you just straight-up guzzled acid. And any regular drinker knows the agony and the ecstasy of the hangover poo. It can feel like the only way to relief: the unfortunate, unavoidable end of any excruciating hangover. The morning after the WIRED holiday party-which started with cocktails at a classy bar and devolved, as is tradition, into late-night scream-singing with buckets of beers at a local karaoke joint-saw the shared office bathroom morph into a toxic warzone. Next-day diarrhea isn't universal and, for some, alcohol actually causes constipation. But it's common enough that it has some well-known, and rather unendearing, nicknames-beer shits, day-after-drinking shits (DADS), rum bum, after-grog bog, and so on. Anyone who's dealt with it knows it can be rough. But why does it happen? To start, you have to understand how the body processes alcohol. Food breaks down in the mouth and stomach before nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestine. Alcohol, on the other hand, bypasses some of that system, splashing down into the stomach, which absorbs about 20 percent of alcohol. The rest moves to the small intestine, which absorbs the remaining booze and sends it along to the liver to metabolize. While your liver processes the equivalent of about one drink per hour, the rest of the alcohol circulates throughout your blood system. Alcohol affects every organ in the human body through the blood stream, including the brain. That's part of why, when you drink heavily, you stumble around and slur your speech. And particularly relevant to this discussion, alcohol depresses the secretion of anti-diuretic hormone in the posterior pituitary gland. Also known as vasopressin, it helps your kidneys balance the amount of water in your body. Now, because your body can't hold on to water as it normally would, you start to expel what you don't absorb-and you find yourself scrolling through Instagram while waiting in the bathroom line to pee. (Once the body catches up, it starts retaining water, which is why you may wake up bloated and puffy.) Diarrhea is a common side effect of diuretics, sure, but alcohol also inhibits the absorption of liquids in your bowels. Studies of alcoholics show that chronic alcohol consumption affects the sections of the intestine that absorb water and sodium, decreases the activity of the enzymes that break down sugars, and make the mucosa more permeable. All of which leads to-you guessed it-diarrhea. Plus, when you've been pounding boozy beverages-and, hopefully, some water-your body has to process much more liquid than usual. And all the while, the rest of your GI tract is getting wrecked, too. Booze affects the muscles surrounding your stomach and intestine, particularly those that hold on to food for digestion. It also reduces contractions in the rectum, which might ""reduce the transit time-and, thus compaction"" of the food in your large intestine which, again, can cause diarrhea. This doesn't even take into account the indigestion-causing, late-night cheese fries you scarfed down or the mixers you had with your booze. And, depending on the person, artificial sweeteners (see: Diet Coke and rum), gluten (beer), and tannins (red wine) can all cause loose stool. The best way to avoid a hangover and the dreaded DADS is to eat a balanced meal before imbibing, stay hydrated, and generally take it easy on the booze. But, if you prefer to live on the wild side, be prepared to ride it out the next day in the bathroom. And maybe think about stocking up on Imodium on your way to the party. Go Back to Top.

"
2431654924,"Steve Jobs once said: ""Good artists copy; great artists steal."" He should know-he stole the quote from Pablo Picasso, who probably didn't come up with it either. This sentiment drives modern game design, which is all about iterating on good ideas. We've compiled some of the best ideas and mechanics from games in the last couple of years that we think would make fantastic foundations for new games as we look forward to 2017. Designers, take note, and steal relentlessly!

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was a surprise smash hit, topping many game of the year lists in 2014. This is all the more impressive because it earned all of that acclaim, in spite of its utterly-forgettable main story. Instead players responded to its finely-tuned balance of systems, centered around the brilliant and innovative Nemesis system for dynamically modelling the ever-shifting orc chain of command as players systematically stalked and assassinated them. Take out a general's bodyguard and the next orc down the line moves up to fill his job. If he happens to be one of your coerced plants, he'll help you when the time comes to take down his new boss. Anyone that kills you, however, gets a promotion, and will probably rub it in your face the next time you cross paths.

The emergent rivalries that formed in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor felt far more personal and memorable than a lot of the scripted relationships in other games we've played since. Where most open-world games can feel like just a map full of icons for you to check off with linear story sprinkled throughout, the Nemesis system grounded Mordor 's action in a dynamic narrative continuity that felt genuinely unique to your particular playthrough. Rumor has it that Shadow of Mordor started its life as a Batman game, with Nemesis system simulating the ranks of the Joker's gang, which makes perfect sense for the system. The genius of Nemesis is only loosely tied to its theme, and the rest of the game was built with pretty stock components, so it wouldn't be too hard to lift it out wholesale and build a different kind of game around it.

Sure, plenty of games do a lot with the physical dangers of dungeon crawling, but not many address the mental and emotional toll that it must surely take - except for Darkest Dungeon , of course. Right below each of your heroes' health bar is a stress meter that ticks up whenever they are witness or subject to something horrible. If it goes too high, they'll acquire an ""affliction"" like paranoia or masochism that will cause them to occasionally defy your orders or act out of turn. More than just complicating the management metagame as you churn through a parade of broken adventurers, the addition of personality traits and afflictions does wonders for making your heroes feel unique. That crusader isn't just a pile of stats that tanks damage for your party-he's also a morose kleptomaniac who took too many delves and now panics whenever your torch burns too low.

Nearly all RPGs are descended from Dungeons & Dragons , which introduced the idea of characters as an assemblage of stats. It's all very externally-focused, however, and even mental stats like intelligence and wisdom only matter for how they affect a character's ability to perform actions. Darkest Dungeon 's stress and afflictions call back to similar mechanics of psychological degredation in horror-themed tabletop RPGs like Call of Cthulhu and Nemesis , in no small part because they all draw inspiration from the works of H. P. Lovecraft. XCOM showed that even minor aesthetic customizations can do wonders for player investment in their characters. Giving them an internal life separate from just being vessels for the player's will takes it to a whole new level that we'd love to see more often.

Creating and Sharing ( Super Mario Maker )

View photos

Super Mario Maker

More

Once just the purview of hobby grade level editors and l33t ROM-hackers, Super Mario Maker gave anyone with a Wii U or 3DS the power to create and share their own Mario levels, remixed from 30 years of Nintendo platforming design. In all media, increasingly powerful personal computers and a globally pervasive peer-to-peer network have democratized the power to create and distribute original work. Games have a higher threshold of technical knowledge to create than books, music, or film, so their craft has remained somewhat more specialized. The success of Super Mario Maker and the LittleBigPlanet series show that laymen are eager to create if given the tools. Even just staying within classic NES games, imagine Zelda Maker or Mega Man Maker. Combining our rampant nostalgia for 80s and 90s games with the fact that modern platforms can much more easily simulate and manipulate that style of game seems like a winning formula.

Augmented Reality ( Pokémon Go )

Pokemon Go Plus

More

While the hype and player count of Pokémon Go trailed off after a few months, for the summer of 2016 it was an unprecedentedly large social gaming event. It didn't matter that it launched with only a handful of the basic features you would expect from a Pokémon game, or that a buggy app and overtaxed servers persisted for months - just the basic fantasy of catching monsters out and about in the real world with some rudimentary augmented reality to see them in situ captured our collective imaginations.

It's hard to envision anything achieving the same zeitgeist-dominating success of Pokémon Go did at its height, but the general principle of using mobile phones to layer gameplay onto the real world is a vast, untapped landscape of design possibility. Go developer Niantic's own earlier game Ingress used the foundation for a vast, team-based area control game. Anything involving a map would work, though. Imagine turning your commute into a fantasy RPG, or running to the corner park in order to make a dead drop for an opposing double agent. While Pokémon Go got by on the charm of its brand and the novelty of its idea, it mostly excited us for the AR games that we could look forward to in the coming years.

Slow Real-Time ( Subterfuge )

[embedded content]

Subterfuge was one of the most harrowing gaming experiences we've ever had. This real-time strategy game for mobile phones is a relatively straight-forward game of area control and resource production in an underwater world, but with the added strategic layer: Moving a unit takes many hours, so the whole game plays out over a week or two. This delay between moves opens up lots of space for IRL diplomacy and backstabbing, wherein the real game lies. While playing, Subterfuge is the last thing you think of before going to sleep and the first thing you check in the morning. It's very stressful, but the experience is uniquely engrossing.

Just like how Pokémon Go took a prosaic game and made it magical by spreading it out over real space, Subterfuge uses time to achieve the same effect. Mobile phones let us consistently check in on things throughout the day, and we would love to see more games that take advantage of this by playing with time scale like Subterfuge does.

Play of the Game ( Overwatch )

View photos

Overwatch proved that Blizzard is still one of the best developers around for creating streamlined and addicting games for the masses. Beyond its slick shooter mechanics, interesting characters, and variety of gameplay modes, one touch that's proven to be particularly ingenious is its ""Play of the Game"" mechanic which automatically highlights one player's particularly dramatic moment from the match based on several criteria, such as difficulty, point swing, or saving fellow teammates.

2016 saw the continued rise of esports in popular consciousness, and the explosive popularity of Overwatch took advantage of that. In addition to being a great source of memes, Replicating highlights from broadcast coverage of traditional sports, Play of the Game is a fun, familiar way to inject the notion that Overwatch is a competition, and give players bragging rights for more than just the win. Any new match-based game would be well-served by its addition, or even established competitive games, such as Rocket League .

Creative first-person perspective in VR ( Superhypercube )

View photos

DT's Favorite Games of 2016

More

Reminiscent of that human Tetris game show from Japan , Superhypercube tasks players with rotating complex, 3D shapes in order to fit through a corresponding hole in a fast-approaching wall. The trick is that it's played in VR, and with the shapes hovering directly in front of your face it becomes increasingly hard to see around them as they get larger and more elaborate.

Relying on a limited first-person perspective, craning your neck to get the full picture, is a unique mechanic to virtual reality that gets at one of our general gripes about what we've seen in VR so far-the general lack of ""medium specificity,"" or design which takes advantage of . Too many developers are spending all of their effort porting existing types of gameplay into VR, rather than exploring types of play that could not exist otherwise. Superhypercube is exactly the sort of stripped-down experiment in the medium's unique properties that we want to see more in the coming year.

""God perspective"" in VR ( Final Approach )

View photos

Flight Control was a crucial early smartphone game, and one of the first to really take advantage of the touchscreen as vehicle for new gameplay. Final Approach , a de facto VR adaptation of Flight Control , takes that principle of tracing out routes for landing planes, but uses the room-scale technology of the HTC Vive to put it in three dimensions. You tower over the airport like a giant, poking at planes and drawing their courses through space. The added depth makes the game substantially more challenging and interesting, and the game also adds all sorts of other interactions like rescue vehicles to keep it fresh.

Much of VR so far has focused on first-person experiences, but Final Approach shows that going the complete opposite direction and utilizing a ""god perspective"" where players exist outside the game world, moving and interacting with it at will, can be just as interesting. A few minutes in the game left us pining for VR real-time strategy like Starcraft , directing troops around with the sweep of a hand as we tower above the battlefield, or a god game like Populous , shaping or destroying virtual worlds. A third-person perspective also has the added benefit of sidestepping the need to simulate first-person movement, which has proven to be very difficult to achieve while avoiding motion sickness.

Mobile Party Games ( Spyfall , The Resistance , etc)

View photos

Mobile games tend to be either solitary affairs (like Threes ), or globally multiplayer (like Clash of Clans ). One area that's sorely lacking is mobile games that let you play with friends who are right there. There are tons of great party board and card games out there like Spyfall , Two Rooms and a Boom , The Metagame , or Skull , and many of them are quite portable, but they still require you to carry them around in anticipation. It would be great if there were more games for mobile phones that you could break out at a moment's notice to play with your friends.

Hidden identity games such as Spyfall or Secret Hitler are generally quite simple to learn, and often just give players a single card for each round with details about their identity, and so they could lend themselves particularly well, perhaps only even requiring one person to own the game while everyone else gets information via text. In any case, we all spend too much time buried in our phones, so we might as well use them as platforms for socializing with the people around us.

""Narrative Legos"" (Ken Levine)

[embedded content]

This one is unique in that it was not inspired by a game, but by a design talk given by BioShock -creator Ken Levine at GDC 2014 . He makes the case that linear storytelling, as we understand it from film, television, theater, and literature, is directly at odds with the uniquely dynamic nature of games. He contrasts systemic games, such as Civilization , with linear games like Uncharted , and expresses his lifelong preference for systemic games and the emergent narratives they can lead to. He follows this by laying out a hypothetical game that takes a systemic approach to narrative, using a typical high fantasy setting to describe a game where narrative events are driven by faction allegiances and character relationships in response to player actions.

One of the closest examples we've yet seen of this is at the top of our list with Shadow of Mordor 's Nemesis system. It was still couched in a conventional (and dull) linear narrative, but despite that it was one of the best gameplay mechanics in years. Expanding that impulse to a whole game is another challenge entirely, and basically requires a new theoretical framework for narratology, but we think it's one of the most important tasks facing game designers today if the medium wants to outgrow being an imitation of cinematic storytelling and tell stories unique to games.

Honorable mention: Non- Warcraft -derived massively multiplayer

World of Warcraft: Legion

More

We couldn't stick this in the main list since it's something we'd like to see a little less: World of Warcraft is great, but its enormous success has utterly murdered creativity in designing massively-multiplayer online games. Barring a handful of exceptions, such as EVE Online , virtually every game that hundreds to thousands of people can play at once is a stat- and loot-driven action RPG that takes countless design cues from the model popularized by World of Warcraft . All massively-multiplayer online games looking the same is a bit like the absurdity of most fantasy, which should be an unbounded genre, being Tolkien-derived swords and sorcery with elves and orcs.

As we said up at the top, game design is built on iteration, but there comes a point of diminishing returns where new MMOs aren't adding anything particularly innovative and are being created at the expense of exploring other types of gameplay. Surely there are countless untapped ways to make huge numbers of players interact online. We understand that the technical infrastructure required to support these games is going to make developers more risk-averse, but that didn't stop Blizzard from breaking open the genre in the first place, and it won't stop whoever comes up with the next big thing.

"
2431656412,"For the last two years , we've put together a list of things to stop giving a s**t about in the new year. These lists are lighthearted and fun, meant to give ourselves and our readers permission to lift some weight off of their shoulders and focus on what truly matters.

But given that 2016 was a year dominated by many Americans seemingly not giving a s**t ― about the political process, about the country, and at times about the basic human rights of our fellow citizens ― reminding ourselves and others to care less about things felt off. In 2016, a lack of f**ks given by some only worked against us as a whole.

So this new year, we resolve to care more . We resolve to embrace action in the face of injustice, joy in the face of oppression, and love in the face of hate. Below are 27 things we'll be giving a s**t about in 2017. Consider getting on board.

1. Organizing, marching and protesting ― even when it feels exhausting and futile.

2. Women's bodily autonomy. Women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Know that in your bones.

3. Surrounding yourself with the people who know you best and adore you most.

4. Fighting the -isms and -phobias : racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia. We will never truly achieve ""a more perfect union"" until these forces of division are eradicated.

5. Authentic female friendships . Nurture old ones and create new ones. These connections are what will take you through dark times.

6. Self-care. As Audre Lorde once said , it can be an ""act of political warfare.""

7. Reading. And not just in that I-read-the-headline-or-Wikipedia-post-and-skimmed-the-text way.

8. Your health, both physical and mental. Make that dentist/gyno/therapy appointment you've been putting off. (And fight like hell for others' access to quality health care.)

9. Reducing waste. Our planet really, really, really needs us.

10. Small acts of kindness. Smile at that couple on the subway; make small talk with the nice drunk girls in the bar bathroom line.

Getty/Huffington Post

Damn right they are.

11. Constructive disagreement. Let's start talking ― in a productive way.

12. Eating delicious things. D onuts, fresh produce, pizza, fresh mozzarella, Nutella, extra crispy bacon... the list goes on.

13. Creating space for marginalized voices.

14. Great orgasms... R egardless of whether they come by way of a partner or a seriously excellent vibrator.

15. Learning to channel your frustrations productively. Take an intense spin class or go to yoga or take up painting. Find a way to turn excess unproductive energy into an activity that's good for the body and soul.

16. Intersectional feminism.

17. Engaging with the political process ― beyond just voting for president. Write letters! Call your representatives! Pay attention to local elections!

18. Sacred spaces. Find yours, whatever ""sacred"" may mean to you. Everyone needs a sanctuary.

19. Showing the young people in your life that there's no one way to be feminine or masculine.

20. Expressing your opinion without fear. Own your point of view, and share it.

21. Taking your vacation days. Lord knows we all may need a few breaks over the next year.

22. Education. Comprehensive, accessible, public education.

23. Empathy. A little can go a long way.

24. Facts. They still matter.

25. Words. They do too.

27. Love.

NBC News - Meet The Press

ANNOUNCER:

From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet The Press was Chuck Todd.

CHUCK TODD:

Good first Sunday morning of 2017 and a happy new year to everybody on this special Meet The Press broadcast. We're going to look at the difficult and sometimes mutually beneficial, but often contentious relationship between Donald Trump and the media. Mr. Trump of course has made no secret of his contempt for those of us who report the news and cover his campaign. Along with promising to build a wall along the U.S./Mexican border, press bashing was the surest route to an applause line on the Trump campaign trail.

(BEGIN TAPE)

DONALD TRUMP:

The media isn't just against me. They're against all of you. That's really what they're against. They're not against me. They're against what we represent.

Among the world's most dishonest people.

The one thing we have done, we have exposed the credibility of the press. They have the lowest credibility.

(END TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

Reliance on free publicity and the easy access he had to TV news shows, including this one, it's worth remembering the joke someone cracked during the campaign. Donald Trump complaining about the media is like an oil man complaining about the smell of crude. So this morning, we're going to take a close look at this love/hate relationship between Donald Trump and the press. We'll talk to the editors of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to a group of top media critics from around the country. But I'm going to start with three people whose job it has been to not just work for a president and deal with him every day of the week, but also deal with the press and the intersection between the presidency and the media.

Joe Lockhart, who was President Bill Clinton's press secretary in the second term. Nicolle Wallace, the communications chief for President George W. Bush in his second term. And Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's very first press secretary. I sat down with the three of them and asked them about the art of working with a president and what they think we can expect from a President Trump.

(BEGIN TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

All right, let's dive right in. Nicolle Wallace, Ari Fleischer, Joe Lockhart, so all of you have had to move from a campaign to the White House. How hard is it to transition from being a campaign sort of advocate to suddenly the spokesperson for the United States of America?

ARI FLEISCHER:

It's a very different reflex. And there's three phases to it, frankly. When you're in the primary, you're talking to your party's voters. And in the general election, you're talking to the nation's voters. When you're at the White House, you're talking to the world. And it's a very different need for how to communicate what to say, how to be nonpartisan at the appropriate times, and finally, you have to know a lot of policy. Because the job is spin, it is politics, but there's a lot of policy. And you better learn it fast.

CHUCK TODD:

I guess I would say, how hard is it to kick the partisan thing at the beginning of this? When you go in, when you transition, how hard is that?

NICOLLE WALLACE:

Well, I mean, we worked for someone whose top priority after winning election was really bringing the country together. The first time he ran as a uniter. And he came into the office after the recount, which was excruciating for the country. And he was aware of that. So he didn't have an urge to continue campaigning after he'd won. And reelection was even more so we were a country engaged in two wars with uneven trajectories at the time of his second inauguration. So there was no resistance on his part to sort of refocusing the country's attention on governing.

JOE LOCKHART:

I think it's an exercise in as a candidate you're responsible for nothing. All problems were made by someone else. All solutions are magically doable and, you know, you can implement that--

CHUCK TODD:

Because you just say it.

JOE LOCKHART:

Yes, because you just say it. And all candidates know that. And then the transition period, I think, is sort of delaying taking responsibility. Everybody comes in and their first instinct is every problem was the last guy's fault. But what you wake up one day (and sometimes it's in January, sometimes it's in February, sometimes it's later) and you realize, ""Nobody's blaming the last guy anymore."" And then it gets to the policy. And it gets to the fact that this is much more important, the stakes are higher, the words you use, the way you say it, where the comma is matters around the world. And it's a much more difficult job.

ARI FLEISCHER:

And you'll appreciate this, but my boss's advice to me, President Bush instructed me, ""Never look backwards. No matter what happened before, it doesn't matter. It's up to us to lead. So no blaming, no looking back.""

And it's an instinct that you have in the campaign. ""Blame everything on the other guy."" Now it doesn't matter, because it's up to you deliver.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

So you got different advice than I got. I walked in--

ARI FLEISCHER:

He said to blame him?

NICOLLE WALLACE:

No, no -- but I walked into the Oval Office between the reelect and becoming White House communications director. And he said, ""Are you ready for the big league? This is the stuff that really matters."" I think Presidents realize what you said, that what happens in the campaign is, you know, when it's over, poof, it vanishes. But what happens when you're President, it's permanent.

CHUCK TODD:

This is a unique challenge for the Trump communications team in this White House. Because there is already an antagonistic or feel that there's an antagonistic relationship between the press corp and the incoming president. Because the incoming president wants to have this--

JOE LOCKHART:

I think that there's always antagonism. And there's always particularly with the president, there's no president that ever woke up in the morning and called their press secretary and said, ""You're doing a great job. I love the way I'm being covered. Everything's fair. And, you know, even the criticism is helping me grow as a president."" Never happened--

CHUCK TODD:

Never happened?

JOE LOCKHART:

Never happened.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

I'm shocked.

JOE LOCKHART:

But I think there's real differences this time to-- you know, we're on opposite sides of the parties. But I think our transitions were really similar, because we share a couple of things. We shared the idea that the press, you know, President relationship was mutually beneficial. The reason that people sit down in that briefing room every day is because both sides get something out of it. I don't think that's the case coming in here. So I think that will-- the second is while we might use extreme spin in some cases, traditionally for the last 50 years, we've operated on the same basic fact set. So, you know, Ari and Nicolle will look at the facts. I'll look at them. And we'll have a great argument about who was right and who was wrong. We're really in a place where (and we haven't seen this, I think, since the '60s with Nixon) where they use their own, they create their own facts. It's, you know, somewhat Orwellian, which, you know, you redefine the past, which means you can define the present and the future. And that's going to be very difficult for both sides to come to grips with.

ARI FLEISCHER:

I think there's a different trend going on. And it's two parts to it. The first is there's a double-barreled hostility. This press corps can't stand Donald Trump. And Donald Trump is happy to return the favor. And he uses it to his advantage. He can use it to his advantage, because as the Gallup poll recently indicated, confidence in the press to report the news accurately and fairly has never been lower. And so the press has made itself vulnerable, because it lost the trust of their readers and their viewers -- and Trump has widely taken advantage of it.

CHUCK TODD:

But is this on the press--

ARI FLEISCHER:

I absolutely--

CHUCK TODD:

No, I understand that. But why isn't there any responsibility on the partisans?

ARI FLEISCHER:

I didn't say there wasn't. I pointed out--

CHUCK TODD:

I feel like partisans have done more--

ARI FLEISCHER:

--accurately about the Gallup poll, which--

CHUCK TODD:

No doubt.

ARI FLEISCHER:

-- pressure the media still has to grapple with.

CHUCK TODD:

Should it matter to the partisan actors, Democratic and Republican actors in here, that they have helped delegitimize--

NICOLLE WALLACE:

I think we're staring at trees and missing the forest. We've just elected a man who bullies female reporters at his rally as an applause line. We have just elected a man who started a hot war with a female anchor instead of intending a debate she moderated. We are in a new place. And I don't think it's good. And I don't think it has any parallels to the past. And I don't think Trump needs the press. But I think he wants them like an addict craves their drugs.

ARI FLEISCHER:

And the press corps is also one of the least -- one of the most reluctant institutions to change, while technology's changed, everything's changing in the White House, press corps especially is still largely dominated and defined by the habits of people viewing in the '90s. And it hasn't changed much.

CHUCK TODD:

Well, let's talk about this. Let's make some changes here. You guys could make changes. I've got my own ideas. And I'll wait till you guys talk. But what are some changes in the relationship between the White House press corps and some traditions that you think deserve-- there's been some talk of upending some of them. What ones would you like to make? I'll start with you, Nicolle.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

Well, I mean, I'm most intrigued by the notion that Trump doesn't think he needs or wants to have a protective pool. The protective pool exists so that on days like 9/11 a president can speak not just to his press or to this country but to the world. So I think changing his mind about the need for a protective pool and then maybe getting the press to be a little more inventive and modern in what that protective pool is made up of would be one of them.

JOE LOCKHART:

I'd make a suggestion for the press. You don't need to follow the president around and, not in the protective way, you don't need to put every word he says on TV and, you know, have a story every day about what he said yesterday. It's easy to find that. All you have to do is put on Twitter or Facebook Live. It is all there. If more resources were put into not just what was said today, but what's actually really happening. I think it'd be a much better service to the public.

ARI FLEISCHER:

I'd make two changes. One is I'd take the briefing off of live TV and embargo it. Make it a much more serious briefing, rather than a TV show where both sides are posturing. And the second is I would democratize the room. There are 750 reporters credentialed to cover the White House with 49 assigned seats. Change the room makeup. On Mondays, let it be the traditional White House press corps. On Tuesday, let it be business journalists. On Wednesday, let it be foreign journalists.

Thursday, I'd love to put Breitbart and Think Progress next to each other in the briefing room and let them ask questions. And not totally be social media day. And then on Friday, you could go back to the White House press corps if you wanted. Move the room around, and then you'll get a lot less gotcha and a lot more substantive questions.

CHUCK TODD:

How about no televised briefing? And I say this-- I was the unpopular guy among my TV colleagues. I believe the televised briefing destroyed the White House briefing.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

So does Mike McCurry.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:

Right--

NICOLLE WALLACE:

So does Mike. Mike has said--

JOE LOCKHART:

So does everybody who's involved. But the reality--

CHUCK TODD:

I miss the gaggle. You get more information out of you, Ari, at the gaggle. You would speak--

ARI FLEISCHER:

But that's when you should give that to the briefing.

CHUCK TODD:

You know, and you Nicolle, and you Joe.

ARI FLEISCHER:

That's why I would take the briefing off of live TV. I would keep it so they can use clips and put it on the news. And also, after September 11th, this country needed to hear the live messages from the White House. So there is a room and a time and a space--

NICOLLE WALLACE:

But can I just stop this conversation. Does anyone think that the press secretary is going to be standing in the room and Trump won't be sitting in the Oval, like, tweeting something that might make bigger news or totally contradict? I mean--

JOE LOCKHART:

Or critiquing his press secretary.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

--I think that the whole convention of conventional-- I mean, I don't even know that this conversation will hold up 60 days into the Trump presidency. Because the idea that he's going to be able to tolerate watching someone at a podium delivering news that he thinks he can do better from whatever he tweets from is an assumption I'm not comfortable making.

CHUCK TODD:

Well, by the way, that's something you guys all I think never have had to experience, which is a principle that will go off the reservation a lot. And not tell you, the people in charge, of sort of--

ARI FLEISCHER:

It's his reservation. He's not -- never off it.

CHUCK TODD:

You're right.

ARI FLEISCHER:

But his staff has to catch up.

CHUCK TODD:

What the staff thinks is the reservation. The guardrails that they were trying to put up.

JOE LOCKHART:

I think the difference is, you know, probably the most important part of having the job is staying close to the president so you know what he's thinking, you know what he's doing.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

Or at least following him on Twitter.

JOE LOCKHART:

But in this case, this president doesn't like to share his views with his inner circle, try it there, and maybe go out-- he wants to share it with the world first. Everything's a trial balloon. Nothing is real. There's nothing that he tweets that's written in stone, because everything he does is to get a reaction and to judge, ""Well, then if, you know, people didn't like that, I won't do that."" That's not operative anymore. And it does go back to, I think, the Nixon days, where poor Ron Ziegler had to go out on a regular basis-- you guys are too young. But had to go out and someone would say, ""Well, you told us yesterday this."" And he said, ""Well, yesterday's news is not operative.""

ARI FLEISCHER:

But the real communicator here is Donald Trump. We're talking staff. We still have to see how Donald Trump handles the huge power he will now have as the president, commander-in-chief, and communicator.

CHUCK TODD:

There is one other job you guys have that people don't realize unless you're a member of the White House press corps and go overseas. And that is when you go overseas, we're all on the same team. And there is this fight that take place overseas when it comes to press access more in the small-D democratic way. And every press secretary, you know, has fought for this in different ways. You know, this is something that, I'll be honest, some White House press corps are concerned, is that going to be there with this team? Are they going to be the protectors of the American press freedom in China?

NICOLLE WALLACE:

I remember fighting with some members of our press corps sometimes. And I said when they'd get their back up, I'd say, ""Listen, don't yell at me. Because when I walk back through that door, I am the only person that gives a hoot that you get what you want before 5:00 p.m. today.""

JOE LOCKHART:

I think there's a phrase that all presidents eventually get when they look at their spokesmen or communicators. And it's ""Your friends in the press."" Like you own them--

CHUCK TODD:

Presidents blame you as if you work for us, they think, right?

ARI FLEISCHER:

But you sort of do--

JOE LOCKHART:

There is a bigger thing here--

ARI FLEISCHER:

--the press secretary does.

JOE LOCKHART:

--which is you do have to fight for access. And not to get too serious here. What we do here does have an impact around the world. We do believe in democracy and we do believe in a free press. And when we undermine it, the rest of the world is watching. So when we go to Russia, which is always a fight. China, always a fight on access things. It sends a message to the people there that a president of the United States will say, ""I'm not going into that meeting unless my press corps can come."" But when we're doing that here, that's a problem.

ARI FLEISCHER:

One of the little-known parts of the job is your desk literally sits equidistance between the front door of the Oval Office and the podium in the briefing room on the other side of you. And the press secretary is paid to represent the president. But you also have to work with and represent the press corps. And it's a terrible balancing act.

CHUCK TODD:

And I think it gets harder and harder for these guys.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

It gets harder for these guys, because he's made so many of them, our own correspondents, personal targets. And I think that one of the things I'm most hopeful will stop is the targeting by name of individual journalists in that room. People don't understand that.

CHUCK TODD:

It's the one thing I asked of him. I said--

NICOLLE WALLACE:

What people don't understand--

CHUCK TODD:

--""Hit the organization, not the person.""

NICOLLE WALLACE:

Right. And the people that cover him will wake up every day and go to work at the White House. That's their place of business. Their desks are under the briefing room. People don't realize that. They don't work in some far away bureau.

CHUCK TODD:

That's right.

NICOLLE WALLACE:

They go to work at the White House.

JOE LOCKHART:

And the real downside for the President is he helped his election bid by undermining the press and having people trust the press less. He's going to find a time where he needs the press to send this message both here and around the world. And that's the real trick. And that's a transition he's going to have to make.

ARI FLEISCHER:

Give him credit. He goes around the press. And he goes through the press. Since election day, he's done interviews with The Today Show, with 60 Minutes, with The New York Times, with The Wall Street Journal, with Time Magazine. So he does a lot of both.

JOE LOCKHART:

And in every one of those interviews, the important message was, ""People out there, trust me. Don't trust what you read or you see."" And the problem is that there's going to be a point at which, in a time of crisis, that he does need a free and strong press to get his message out, I believe. That could be old-fashioned.

CHUCK TODD:

You guys delivered. This was a fascinating discussion. And I will get yelled at by all my television colleagues for wanting to get rid of the televised briefing. But there you go. Anyway, Nicolle Wallace, Ari Fleischer, Joe Lockhart, a lot of fun here turning the tables.

(END TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

When we come back, from press secretaries to press critics. I sit down with four people whose job it is to cover the people who cover the president. In other words, us, the media.

***COMMERCIAL BREAK***

CHUCK TODD:

Welcome back. Throughout the campaign, we at NBC News sent a team of younger journalists, we call them ""embeds,"" to cover all the candidates who were running for president in all the states where they were running. It was a 24/7 job literally. You're a young political journalist, there may be no better way to get into the political world. So we thought we'd ask our embeds to reflect a little bit on their journey throughout 2016.

(BEGIN TAPE)

JORDAN FRASIER:

The hardest part about the campaign in so many ways is that it's sensory overload. From morning to night, there is just so much information coming at you.

ALEX JAFFE:

It was nonstop for seven days, a different city every night, sometimes three different cities every day.

KAILANI KOENIG:

One of the things that I liked best about the campaign trail was watching candidates get grilled by voters in places like New Hampshire, where people will just be able to walk right up to them and ask them the most pressing questions of their lives.

DANNY FREEMAN:

The kindness of Iowa voters was one of my favorite parts of the campaign trail. There was this one time I remember I was at the Iowa State Fair, very much lost and confused. And a farmer came up to me and showed me around, helped me understand where I was inside the pig barn, at the time. And he said, ""I want to do this for you, because I hope if my son ever goes to New York someone will be kind enough to do the same for him.""

ALI VITALI:

My most memorable interaction with Donald Trump was when I was taken into the buffer area around the stage over a rally during Christmas and asked to shoot cuts of the candidate up close, which is a normal piece of being an embed on the campaign trail. And as I got up there, I was holding my camera. And Donald Trump in the middle of his speech, turned and pointed to me and said--

DONALD TRUMP:

Look, here we have NBC. They're supposed to be back there, but that's okay.

ALI VITALI:

That was probably the most memorable and definitely the most bizarre interaction.

JORDAN FRASIER:

One of my favorite moments from the campaign trail happened in New Hampshire as Governor Bush was on a bus tour. And it was in the middle of a snowstorm. And I'm outside the bus with my camera raised, ready to film him. And as he's walking by me, he bends down and he forms a snowball. And he throws it at me. And he gets this big laugh out of it. And it was this moment that I'll always remember his personality really shining through.

JEB BUSH:

You can't do anything about it.

JORDAN FRASIER:

No.

JEB BUSH:

That's not fair, actually--

VAUGHN HILLYARD:

The night that Mike Pence's plane goes off the runway, New York City, LaGuardia Airport, rain coming down. The plane lands. It veers. You kind of start to smell the rubber come up. And it's one of those moments where it's, like, you still got a job to do. You pick up the camera. You start filming. And you realize you can't believe this is happening.

SHAQUILLE BREWSTER:

Having a room full of voters who are there to see Dr. Carson at a campaign event in Iowa break out in a happy birthday song for me at a staffer's direction was one of the most memorable moments on the campaign. You know, you're going so many places. And sometimes you're giving up your birthday. And, you know, that really just made it special.

MONICA ALBA:

This was absolutely the best year and a half of my life, both professionally and personally. And I think what will make it so special is that I probably will never do it again, at least not this way.

(END TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

Never do it again, but you'll never forget. Unbelievable group of young journalists. We're very lucky here at NBC. We'll be back in 90 seconds with our panel of media critics.

***COMMERCIAL BREAK***

CHUCK TODD:

Welcome back. Let's face it. The press has had a rough year. In our latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, just 16% of those surveyed had a great deal or quite a bit of confidence in the national news media. Fully 55% said they had very little or no confidence at all in us. Talk about uniting a polarized country. That, by the way, puts us behind the financial industry, which almost destroyed the economy a few years ago, and the federal government, and you know how people feel about those guys.

So a few days ago, we decided to bring together four people who make it their business to tell us what we're doing wrong and on some occasions, what we're actually trying to do right. David Folkenflik of NPR, Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel, Claire Atkinson of The New York Post, and Gabe Sherman of New York Magazine, who is also an NBC News media analyst.

(BEGIN TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

You have a president, right now a president-elect, but a president who has made no bones that he wants an antagonistic relationship with the press corps. It's almost-- He's almost goading the press corps, goading folks like us to have an antagonistic relationship. Not since Nixon has that been this up front and perhaps not even-- it wasn't that up front then.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

Oh, I think that's right. I think he's prospered politically by being hostile to the press, antipathetic, suggesting he would go and create policies, make the libel laws easier to sue the press. His aides are-- Reince Priebus saying he's going to perhaps dispense with the briefings in the White House, all kinds of symbolic and rhetorical flourishes to show his hostility to the press in a way that, you know, makes it hard to have that usual kind of honeymoon feeling when a new administration sweeps in.

I think the press has to be open to the fact that this could be a conventional presidency, it could be a highly successful one. It could be ones that ultimately has some notions of transparency and accountability. But I don't think that it needs to sit back on its heels and just find out agnostically. I think it has to be ready to be aerobic.

I think it has to sort of operate on a split track, where it really watches the president's rhetoric and his administration for what it intends to do, but also saying, ""We're going to watch the rules, the regulations, the appointments, the treaties, the policies, what we embrace, what we dispose of from the Obama administration. What are they doing in our name? How are they deploying the enormous mechanism of government?""

CHUCK TODD:

So if any report that Donald Trump doesn't like, and you have the president of the United States tweeting out, ""Don't believe the NBC Nightly News, don't believe The New York Times, don't believe The Orlando Sentinel, they don't know what they're talking about,"" his people are not going to believe The New York Times. They're not going to believe the NBC Nightly-- What do you, what do you do as a member of the press, when you have that where he is telling essentially half the country, ""ignore""?

HAL BOEDEKER:

Keep going. Keep doing your job. You're serving the whole public, not just Mr. Trump's supporters. And keep remembering that. That more people voted for other candidates than Donald Trump. And going back to that question, I would say his business is central, that needs to be explored. I think that has great repercussions for what's going to happen in the next four years. What are his connections with other countries, the family? I think that's central in the early days.

GABE SHERMAN:

That's the big question will be ultimately how much does the media, you know, chase the shiny object that Trump's throwing out each morning? I mean, you know, he's-- The fact that he's tweeting is not news at this point. I mean, we got to cover what the president-elect and the president says.

But the fact that he's going to say something outrageous that then becomes the focus of the coverage I think is abdicating the role, which is the media should be setting the agenda and deciding what is the news. And yes, when the president says something, we cover it. But we should not just be ping ponging back and forth from his tweets.

CHUCK TODD:

What can the Washington press corps, Claire, learn from Donald Trump's incredible interactions with the tabloids of New York over the last 30 years?

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Oh, that's a great question. Obviously he's a--

CHUCK TODD:

I ask you that since you are at The New York Post.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Absolutely.

CHUCK TODD:

I mean you know this well.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

I mean, he is a creature of The New York Post and of the tabloid world.

CHUCK TODD:

And he loves it, right?

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

He's been a feature of our front pages for many years, does love it. He obviously loves reading the paper as well. And I think he is a lover of all journalism. And I think that he reads things closely, like you say. He's in contact with journalists. And I think-- I feel like-- I'm an immigrant, obviously, and I'm from England and I voted for the very first time in this election.

And I was very taken aback by the results, as I think a lot of people were. And when I'm chatting with folks out there, they tell me two things. They tell me first that the media whiffed on this campaign completely.

CHUCK TODD:

Heard that a million times.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Yes. And then they tell me that they don't know what's real. Like they-- Even very smart people tell me, ""I don't know what to believe anymore."" And I think that's a really shocking thing, that we're in this world where people don't know what the facts are. And if the facts are out there, then there's people denying them. And it brings us to the whole world of fake news. And, I mean, I wanted to bring up the topic of the economics of the media business. They are really dominated by Google and Facebook. Digital advertising is going to be top TV for the first time next year, $200 billion in ad spending on digital.

And Google and Facebook have this huge role to play as members of the media, even if they're not actually employing journalists. People are getting their media from, you know, the fake news sites that are funded by Google AdWords, the stuff that turns up on Facebook. Facebook said that they are starting to ask users to flag fake news. So I think we're-- You know this whole-- We're in a whole--

CHUCK TODD:

Which sounds like a nightmare--

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

--new era.

CHUCK TODD:

--by the way. That does not--

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

It's a-- They want to keep their hands clean.

CHUCK TODD: Yeah.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

They don't want to be censors. They want to be, have other people crowdsource the news and review it like it's Yelp or something.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

So let's, so let's build on that. So the tabloid press has this great symbiotic relationship with Trump because he gives them, he feeds them even stuff that's sometimes seemingly critical about himself to them over the decades so that they can put him in Page Six. They can put him in--

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Well, one thing I want to say about that actually is our Page Six editor Emily broke a big story about the news meeting that Donald had. And there were tons of stories out there about how Donald Trump had planted it or Steve Bannon had made a call. Completely wrong. Our good reporting found out what happened.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

I'm even thinking about going back to his days about coverage of his matrimonial scandals and things like that. So there's the distraction factor. It's represented today in his tweeting. He can divert us anytime he wants. He sees something in The Times, he sees something on TV. He'll tweet about it. We report on tweeting, Hamilton the musical, whatever. That's fine. You know, that could be a box on Page Six every day, Mr. President Tweets.

GABE SHERMAN:

You know I've covered the Trump campaign, I've covered the media and, you know, I find the Trump campaign, in a certain way, more transparent than a lot of other institutions I've covered. And if you-- rewind to the Obama administration, I mean, incredibly nontransparent. Trump sources love the gossip, they love to talk to reporters.

Trump himself loves to talk to reporters. So I do think that there is a little bit of an overplay here that this is the least transparent.

CHUCK TODD:

But let me-- And I will say, he loves-- Look, he loves old school press. Loves magazines, he loves all this stuff. This could be a honeymoon for sort of old media.

GABE SHERMAN:

Of course.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

I was going to say--

CHUCK TODD: Yes.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

I've seen some of the best political reporting since the campaign began. Tough interviewing.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

But let's differentiate two kinds of-- Let's differentiate two kinds of transparency. He has done more interviews than you've seen in perhaps ever.

CHUCK TODD:

That's right.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

And it's been astonishing to see. He doesn't necessarily always be forthcoming, he might not answer the questions, but he's definitely there. His campaign staffers are engaged with you guys and talking to people who covered the campaign. And that's a good thing. But when it gets to the meat of the matter, when it gets to what are these, you know, layers upon layers of LLCs and, you know, corporate holdings, what are-- you know, Mr. Trump's taxes. You know, we don't know some of the key things that I think we need to evaluate him.

CHUCK TODD:

How do you define objectivity in the age of Trump? And I say this because, you know, Trump's going to have his own version of it, who's fair and what's not. Trump has what I call sort of concierge, concierge media friends. I'm not going to name names here, but we all know who they are. Basically, people he knows that can help steer a conversation for him or get rid of. And it's in multiple networks, it's all over in multiple print publications. How does a mainstream press corps deal with that?

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Harvard Kennedy School had a report out last week. They look-- They analyze positive and negative news reports. And they found that during the election, Trump had a 77% negative and Clinton had 64 and it was almost the inverse for the full campaign. But the point they were making was--

CHUCK TODD:

They both got negative press is what you're saying.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

--they both had very, very negative press.

CHUCK TODD:

And they had both negative favorable ratings.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Exactly. And, you know, I think the point, the point there is that the press shook these candidates upside down for two, almost two years. And, you know, what did they find out? Did we really get the answers we wanted?

CHUCK TODD:

Right, was it fair?

GABE SHERMAN:

You know, I think both campaigns, you talk to the Clinton people, they always feel besieged. I think when you deci-- let candidates decide what's fair, I think that's, you know, that's just the wrong ballgame. I think the reporters and, you know, the journalism industry as a whole should sort of assess, ""Was the coverage fair?"" That's what, you know, these, these panels like the Harvard gathering were about.

You know, we come together to sort of hash out how was the coverage. I think the consensus was that, while there was some very good coverage in 2016, some great enterprise coverage, I think the general tenor was that the media missed this election.

CHUCK TODD:

I guess what I-- Let me ask you guys this though. Define media. I always like to say that to-- Define media. The journalism of the mainstream media I thought was outstanding this year. But the loudest voices, Hal, are not mainstream journalists.

HAL BOEDEKER:

That criticism works when you say, ""It's reported in The New York Times."" When you're specific, then it registers. When you're saying, ""the media,"" you know, then we're just a punching bag. And I don't think, you know, that just doesn't matter--

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

--it speaks to how we get our news. We get our news by our phones. We don't get a big newspaper and the ability to read a 1,000 word story on a phone can be difficult. My friends were telling me, ""Well, I really wanted to know about that health care topic, but I had a popup and then I couldn't get to the second page."" And, you know, this is the reality of how people consume their news today.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

When we think about fairness, and I think that that is now the standard increasingly that people we think of as journalists aspire to, as opposed to objectivity, where we're being evenhanded. The question is are we being fair to the subject? Are we being contextual? Or are we rendering it in a way that's understandable and that people recognize themselves in?

I think that we, part of what we're trying to do is figure out an incredibly asymmetrical campaign year. You know, this isn't Bush-Gore, you know, two figures who are clear politicians come up. You are examining somebody with 100% name recognition in Donald Trump, who has never held or even run for elective office. You're examining somebody with Hillary Clinton who's held a bunch of offices and been in a public eye, a public sphere in a sense as first lady as well for, you know, two and a half decades.

And she's been gone over every element of her candidacy and her record in a thousand different ways, and he's had none of this done. So he's having everything scrutinized, particularly I want to say, in the general election. I got to say, in the primary season, I wouldn't say that the press did wonderfully, the conventional press.

I'd say that they basically, the cable outlets essentially acquiesced to his programming. And I'd say that there wasn't a lot of scrutiny because people were, even though he led except for about 72 hours, pillar to post for a year in the polls, in the primaries, people didn't really think it was going to happen. So they didn't give him the kind of scrutiny that suddenly you saw an incredible tsunami of in the general election.

But it seems to me that when you're having an-- one finding after another about Trump with implications in the public sphere, it looks very negative. At the same time, that's the fact checking. On the Clinton side, you also found the news agenda hijacked a bit by the Russian hacks and the WikiLeak dump, which meant that every day they were responding to something different. And this was as asymmetrical a pace for the two campaign coverages that I think I've ever seen.

HAL BOEDEKER:

And they were just both so unpopular. I mean, just unpopular. I mean, I went home, asked my dad and my brother, ""Would you have ever thought of voting for Hillary Clinton?"" And they both laughed and they dropped some expletives and they went off on how corrupt they thought she was. So then my dad starts criticizing Trump. And I'm just like-- And he goes, ""Well, he has to be better than what we have."" So I think maybe the media missed this frustration out there in the heartland. I think that may be one strand that wasn't in the coverage.

CHUCK TODD:

Will the media's reputation be worse? And it's the final question for everybody. Try to keep it short for all four of you. Be worse or better at the end of 2017 in the first year of the Trump presidency? Gabe?

GABE SHERMAN:

I hope it's better. I hope that, you know, once Trump is the president, that the conventional media will cover him and he will be accountable. He'll no longer be a candidate. He will be the president and his voters will want to know, ""Is he delivering on his promises?""

CHUCK TODD:

Reputationally-wise, what do you think that the media will be with the public?

DAVID FOLKENFLIK:

I think there's the great potential for it to be better. I think it took a lot of hits that were unfair, as a lot of hits that are fair. And at that same time, I think the reputation will all be a result of conscious choices being made by journalists, by their executives, by their corporate backers in a lot of sense to say, ""We're going to be up for the challenge, and yet, we're going to embrace this fairly.""

HAL BOEDEKER:

I hope it's better. But I think a lot depends on how he reacts and how his White House reacts.

CHUCK TODD:

I think that's fair. Claire, final word.

CLAIRE ATKINSON:

Yeah, I think we're going to see the apple cart completely overturned. We're going to see news outlets take precedence that haven't before. I mean, I have a stat here, Steve Bannon's Breitbart website went from 132 in the top news sites for November, to 38. Just to put some context around that, HuffPost was 40. I mean, we're going to see new outlets come and dominate the news cycle. And, you know, what's real and fake will I think be up for debate still.

CHUCK TODD:

I think individual outlets'll be better and the overall reputation'll be worse.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK: I think that's entirely possible.

CHUCK TODD:

Somehow, both things are true.

(END TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

Well, we'll be back in a moment with the view from basically the other side, the editors of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

***COMMERCIAL BREAK***

CHUCK TODD:

And we are back. To hear Donald Trump tell it, most news organizations were politically biased, going out of business or both. But the challenges of reporting on Trump went beyond his habit of taking aim at journalists. I recently talked with two of the most important newspaper editors in the country, Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal and Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times. I began my talk with Baquet, who I asked, if he would've covered Donald Trump differently, knowing what he knows now.

DEAN BAQUET:

Sure, I would've done stuff differently. I'm not sure I would've covered him differently as a candidate. I think I would've tried to go a little bit deeper in understanding the anger in the country. It was the same anger in the country that led to the rise of Bernie Sanders and led to the rise of Donald Trump.

I think if news organizations made a mistake, and I can only speak for my own, I think that we wrote stories about anger in the country. We even did a series called Anxiety in America. But, of course, we should've done more. And I think people would've been less surprised, had we done more. That's what I would've done differently.

CHUCK TODD:

How much of this do you think -- Here's what I've chalked up some of the Trump coverage to in our own, which is we in the Acela Corridor of the media from New York to DC knew Donald Trump the person too well. And let that almost cloud or dominate our own focus in ways we didn't realize really until after the fact.

DEAN BAQUET:

You know, I guess I'm going to make the case that the coverage of Donald Trump the person and Donald Trump the candidate was actually quite strong, if you look at the whole of the press. Given what he didn't share, like his taxes and information about his income, we learned a lot about him.

We learned a lot about his business. We learned a lot about him as a person. I think what we could've done better was to understand why the country found Donald Trump appealing and why the country found him more appealing than some of the more traditional candidates like Jeb Bush.

CHUCK TODD:

You feel as if he is well-vetted, even though we've never seen his tax returns?

DEAN BAQUET:

No. I think he was well-investigated.

CHUCK TODD:

Got you.

DEAN BAQUET:

I think there're some huge, unanswered questions. We don't actually know how wealthy he is. We don't actually know what he owns, what he doesn't own. We've taken stabs at how much debt he has. We don't quite know the full extent of his financial dealings in some of the countries where he's going to have to make huge decisions. There's a lot we don't know.

I was sort of addressing the issue of what the press could've done differently. But I think there's a huge amount we don't know about Donald Trump and his finances. And even, I would say, what he believes in. I think that Donald Trump himself has said many things about different issues. He's said different things when he met with The New York Times. He has said different things in large rallies. I think that there are a lot of question marks about Donald Trump.

CHUCK TODD:

Well, it's interesting you put it that way. When it comes to Donald Trump's opinion of The New York Times, I think it depends on who his audience is. Let me play you two clips of him, talking about The New York Times. And there were two very different audiences when he talked about it. Here they are.

(BEGIN TAPE)

DONALD TRUMP:

The failing New York Times, and it is failing, it won't be in business, in my opinion, more than three or four more years, they said in an article, in a major article, ""Let's face it. Balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator.""

DONALD TRUMP:

The Times, it's a great, great American jewel, world jewel. And I hope we can all get along.

(END TAPE)

DEAN BAQUET:

I agree. I agree with the second characterization completely.

CHUCK TODD:

Well, the audience was I think you and the rest of The New York Times for that second one. Obviously, the first one was a rally.

DEAN BAQUET:

That's right. That's right.

CHUCK TODD:

This presents a very difficult situation. I face it myself personally from him sometimes, we face it as a network, where he personalizes coverage and disagreements about coverage with the organization and sometimes with individual reporters. You're a human being, I'm a human being. It's not easy sometimes doing that. How are you instructing your journalists to handle the personal attacks that may come his way in a very public setting?

DEAN BAQUET:

Yeah. Well, I have two points. First off, the things he has said about the press in general are troublesome. I mean, and whatever audience he's playing to. He has said things that should make all journalists nervous about his view of the First Amendment, about his view of a press that's supposed to ask him tough questions. So that makes me nervous.

On the other hand, in covering him, what I instruct my staff and what I try to do myself is we have a huge obligation to cover this guy aggressively and fairly. And that means not letting personalities get in the way. Of course, it's annoying if somebody says that you're the failing New York Times. Especially, by the way, since it's not true.

CHUCK TODD:

And you want to scream, ""What are you-- oh no,"" but then you look--

DEAN BAQUET:

That's right.

CHUCK TODD:

--defensive, right?

DEAN BAQUET:

No, that's right. My view is the way to deal with all questions about journalism is more journalism and good journalism, deep, investigative reporting and deep questioning reporting. And to put whatever personal stuff he says about my institution off to the side. Other than the fact that some of the things he says about journalists and journalism is troublesome.

CHUCK TODD:

Let me ask you two more questions on this front. One has to do with having an op-ed page. Obviously, we have one on television with cable on certain parts of a different cable channels. And it's a question I've asked of other -- and it's, look, we've had editorial pages and regular newspaper coverage for years all over the country. The conflation that has taken place today between opinion and news is harder and harder to sort of unwrap, unravel. Do you think it makes it that your job is harder today because of that, even though the opinion page has always been what it's been?

DEAN BAQUET:

Sure, it is. It's harder today partly because the medium where people read us most, let's say on the phone, it's a little bit, I mean, there is a vast space between the front page of The New York Times and the opinion page of the New York Times. Literal space. And I think it makes it easier to create a separation, just a geographic separation that's a lot harder to do on the phone. That said, I do think readers sort of understand that Paul Krugman does not work for me.

CHUCK TODD:

You do think that? You do think readers do know that for sure?

DEAN BAQUET:

Well, Paul, who I think is a fabulous columnist and criticizes me sometimes.

CHUCK TODD:

No, I know. He gets us all.

DEAN BAQUET:

No, no, I didn't mean personally. I think they do. I think we have to work harder to make it, to make the distinction clearer. I think they do. Let's not kid ourselves. Even in the print era, people didn't always make the distinction. I think it's harder to do now, especially in the presentation on the phone, but I sort of think they do.

CHUCK TODD:

I think my final question to you here, and I thought it was a fabulous op-ed in The New York Times from mid-December, and it was by Masha Gessen. And it was writing about Trump. ""By denying known and provable facts, as when Mr. Trump denies making statements he has made or by rejecting facts that are not publicly known as with the C.I.A.'s information on Russian hacking, Mr. Trump exercises his ever growing power over the public sphere. The resulting frenzy of trying to prove either the obvious known facts or the classified and therefore unknowable facts, two fruitless pursuits, creates so much static that we forget what we are really talking about.""

And I think it's especially challenging for reporters when you want to fact check the guy you're covering, and he wants you to fact check some small thing, while avoiding the bigger story.

DEAN BAQUET:

Yeah. I actually think we had a really interesting debate in our daily news meeting about how to handle Donald Trump's tweets. And I was hearing from so many people, I thought we had to discuss it. And in the end, he's the President of the United States. And in the end, everything he says, small and large, bears scrutiny and reporting.

Will there get to be a point, you know, a year from now, where he is tweeting about, you know, what he saw at the theater last night and that's less interesting? Maybe. On the other hand, you've got to admit that if the president of the United States tweets something about something he watched or something that upsets him, you've got to scrutinize it.

These aren't press releases. These are the personal utterances of the president. I think we have to treat them with balance, right? If he tweets about a world issue or about Russia, big story. If he tweets about Vanity Fair, small story, but a small story that offers a little bit insight into his temperament too.

CHUCK TODD:

Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times.

DEAN BAQUET:

Thank you.

CHUCK TODD:

It's going to be interesting times up ahead, but I'm with you. I'm optimistic about--

DEAN BAQUET:

Good.

CHUCK TODD:

--the future of journalism. Thanks, Dean.

DEAN BAQUET:

Good. So am I. Take care.

CHUCK TODD:

Next, I spoke with Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal and I began our conversation asking how the Journal responds to the public broadsides from the president-elect.

CHUCK TODD:

Like The New York Times, like NBC News, Donald Trump has targeted The Wall Street Journal specifically. Here's one one time in South Carolina in the middle of the primary campaign.

(BEGIN TAPE)

DONALD TRUMP:

I'm not a believer in The Wall Street Journal. I think it's a piece of garbage. It's going to lose a fortune anyway. Don't worry, it'll be out of business like all the rest of them very soon.

(END TAPE)

CHUCK TODD:

Obviously, filled with hyperbole and sarcasm. How did you handle the direct attacks?

GERARD BAKER:

You know, you have to get used to it, Chuck. You get used to the, you know, those kind of attacks. You get used to this kind of strange tough love that sort of Donald Trump, his modus operandi for dealing with the press. He'd say exactly things like that and he'd attack our reporters individually, he'd attack anything we'd done, anything he didn't like. And then at the same time, you also know how much he actually reads the newspaper or watches TV.

CHUCK TODD:

It was interesting. There was I guess a leaked memo where you went to the newsroom, you said, reemphasizing, ""Everybody's got to be fair to him."" Were you concerned that the personal attacks were going to make some of your reporters react? They're human. We're all human beings. And when you personally get attacked, it's hard to sort of set that aside. Were you concerned about that in your newsroom--

GERARD BAKER:

I was concerned about that. Look, I think there is, it's certainly true that Donald Trump has been a different kind of candidate, presumably will be a different kind of president. He operates outside the mainstream. He says things that are challengeable, to put it mildly, that are questionable. And I think a lot of reporters somehow feel very much that they are part of the, they're in the contest, really. And that it's their job to take him on. And, of course, it's reporters' jobs to take everybody on, you know, to test everything that a politician says against the truth. But I was concerned. And it was things, Chuck, things like Twitter. I mean, a lot of our reporters, your reporters too, your colleagues, tweet the whole time. Social media's become such an important part of it. And they would go beyond the reporting of the story.

CHUCK TODD:

To give, like, a bar conversation.

GERARD BAKER:

Yeah, yeah, yeah, they'd offer their commentary on a story on Twitter. And I was concerned, look, you know, you're entitled to your own views about Donald Trump. You're entitled to your own views about Hillary Clinton. But you know, our readers -- It's about trust. If our readers see that you're saying scathing things about Donald Trump on Twitter or they hear you on TV saying things in a commentary way that appear to be very critical and hostile to Donald Trump, they're not going to trust what you write.

Even when you're writing, absolutely write fairly, you report fairly. But if they think that you are coming from a position, they're not going to trust you. So I was very concerned that we be seen to be fair. We be fair to all candidates and we not be seen to be out there kind of engaged in the political debate.

And I do think one of the problems with trust in this country is that, for a very long time, people have seen news presented by news organizations in a way that they think is unfair. You know, it's no accident, there's the old joke about Fox News, when Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes started Fox News 20 years ago, that they said, you know, they were catering for a niche audience. And it turns out the niche is 50%, right? People were unhappy with the mainstream media, whether it was newspapers, television or whatever. So they did see an opportunity.

CHUCK TODD:

The issue of facts. We don't -- people always say, ""You've got to fact check, you've got to fact check."" There isn't an agreement on what the facts are. And this is yet another challenge for you and everybody here. Do you feel comfortable saying so and so lied? You know, if somebody says just an outright falsehood, do you say the word, ""lie""? Is that important to start putting in reporting, or not?

GERARD BAKER:

You know it's a good -- I'd be careful about using the word, ""lie."" ""Lie"" implies much more than just saying something that's false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead. I think it's perfectly -- when Donald Trump says thousands of people were on the rooftops of New Jersey on 9/11 celebrating, thousands of Muslims were there celebrating, I think it's right to investigate that claim, to report what we found, which is that nobody found any evidence of that whatsoever, and to say that.

I think it's then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say, ""This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what? I don't think that's true."" I think if you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they've lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you are, like you're not being objective.

And I do think also it applies -- this is happening all the time now, people are looking at Donald Trump's saying and saying, ""This is false. It's a false claim."" I think people say, ""Well, you know what? Hillary Clinton said a lot of things that were false."" I don't recall the press being quite so concerned about saying that she lied in headlines or in stories like that.

CHUCK TODD:

All right. If you could wave a magic wand and you became sort of the arbiter of what the relationship of the press corps should be with powerful people in Washington and Wall Street, what would you change?

GERARD BAKER:

I think that it's a little, it's interesting. I think it's a little too deferential. Going back to what you said, Chuck, about the British media, again, the British media have lots of flaws. And I wouldn't want to replicate what the British media do here. They're great, they have a slightly kind of, they have a much edgier approach. There are many things that I don't like about the British press, but there is certainly a lack of deference.

And I think if you take any of the big -- the way in which the media cover stories, I think there is in this country still a slight sense, and it's understandable because the presidency itself is an institution of state. It's very important. It's very much a part of, you know, the Constitutional arrangement.

And I think there is a sense that people have some kind of deference towards it. I think there needs to be a little less deference, a little less insider behavior. A little less coziness that there's been sometimes between the media and the major political institutions.

CHUCK TODD:

I agree on that too. Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal --

GERARD BAKER:

Thank you very much.

CHUCK TODD:

-- great conversation. Happy new year.

GERARD BAKER:

Thanks, Chuck.

CHUCK TODD:

There you go. Two men behind the print journalism that drives a lot of coverage, Dean Baquet of The New York Times and Gerard Baker of The Wall Street Journal. When we come back, data doesn't have another emotions. You can't hurt data's feelings or bruise its ego. And that's a very good thing because data, you had a very bad year. And no one is happier to see 2017 than, well, data. It's a long way of saying our very special data download is next.

***COMMERCIAL BREAK***

CHUCK TODD:

Welcome back. Data download time for 2017. But let's be honest, 2016 was a bad year for data. From the United States, to our friends across the pond in the U.K., this was a bad year to use data to create odds. A bad year for trying to predict things. And, of course, top of that list, Donald Trump winning the presidency.

Going into Election Day, Five-Thirty-Eight-dot-com had Trump as a long shot, with a 28.6 percent chance of winning. The New York Times' upshot had him at just 15 percent. Others had him as low as 2 percent. But we all know how this story ends. Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote. Donald Trump marched to victory in the Electoral College. And his inauguration, of course, is just a few short weeks away.

But even before Trump bested the odds makers politically, we already had a sign from Britain that this might be a tough year for political predictions all around the world in June on the eve of that referendum vote to determine whether or not the United Kingdom would leave the European Union, British gambling company Ladbrokes put the odds of a leave vote at just 10 percent.

Of course, Brexit won. And today, U.K. politicians are trying to figure out how to unwind their EU ties.

But the shortcomings of data went even beyond the world of politics and into the other world, where I like to spend some time, sports. In June, the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame their city's losing streak to win the NBA championship. After the Cavs fell behind in that series against the Warriors three to one, the odds of King James taking home the title at that point had climbed to as high as 40 to one. Well, we all know what happened. The Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to come back from a three to one deficit and raise that Larry O'Brien trophy.

In October, the Chicago Cubs shook off a 108 year old World Series drought and overcame their own three games to one deficit. In fact, before this year, there were 34 world series where one team took a three to one lead. And the trailing team only came back to win five times. That's fewer than 15 percent of the time. Another upset.

Finally, let's travel back across the pond to Leicester City, coming from nowhere, and I mean, nowhere, to win the English Premier League soccer championship, or you might call it football, I should say. Before the season started, Leicester City's odds of winning were a whopping 5,000 to one.

All right, all of these results, of course, made these numbers look a little silly. There's been a lot of focus, especially in politics, on how pollsters ""Got it wrong."" But a bigger lesson for those of us in the media is to not worry so much about predicting the future. As journalists, we're going to report on what is actually happening. History matters, but history is made to not be repeated sometimes too. So maybe we shouldn't try to offer odds on what may happen. But since nothing has been turning out how anyone predicted it would, with the NFL playoffs around the corner, it might be time to start shorting the New England Patriots in thinking that they are some shoe in for the Super Bowl.

All right, that is all for this first Sunday of 2017. Thanks for watching. Have a safe and happy new year. Enjoy all the football in the next 48 hours because we'll back next week, because in 2017, as always, if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.

2431660103,"Renováveis em Portugal: um dos marcos de 2016
 
O jornal The Guardian considera que os quatro dias em que vivemos só com energias renováveis são um dos marcos do ano 2016.
Mark Miodownik é engenheiro, professor da University College Londonn e é o principal responsável pela escolha das fontes de energia renovável portuguesas como um dos acontecimentos do ano que está a acabar.
Para o painel dos especialistas ouvidos pelo The Guardian, entre os 12 acontecimentos científicos mais relevantes em 2016, positivos ou negativos, só o surgimento do vírus Zika e a aterragem vertical do reutilizável foguetão SpaceX, ficaram à frente das energias portuguesas.
Tudo porque, entre 4 e 11 de Maio, o consumo energético de Portugal foi abastecido durante 107 horas com recurso apenas a energias renováveis. Sem recurso a fontes fósseis como o carvão ou o petróleo.
Para o cientista, a melhor forma de evitar as alterações climáticas passa por nos afastarmos dos «combustíveis fósseis», o que Portugal está a querer fazer.
«O sucesso de Portugal dá aos governos e companhias de energia um exemplo palpável de como é e como pode ser possível, e ainda porque é que eles devem continuar a investir no solar, vento e outras tecnologias renováveis», refere Miodownik."

2431660503,"'Asking Forgiveness': Celebrating the New Year in Space (Part 2) By Ben Evans Members of the Expedition 42 crew celebrate New Years Eve on the International Space Station (ISS) on 31 December 2014/1 January 2015. Photo Credit: Terry Virts / NASA (@AstroTerry via Twitter) Last night, six pairs of eyes were glued to the windows of the International Space Station (ISS), straining to catch a first glimpse of fireworks around the world, as humanity bade farewell to 2016 and ushered in 2017. As described in yesterday's AmericaSpace history article, Expedition 50 Commander Shane Kimbrough of NASA and his crewmates-Russian cosmonauts Sergei Ryzhikov, Andrei Borisenko, and Oleg Novitsky, together with U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson and the first French national to celebrate the New Year in space, Thomas Pesquet-observed the transition in quiet fashion. For 17 consecutive years, men and women from the United States and Russia, Japan and Italy, the Netherlands and Canada, the United Kingdom, and now France have witnessed the turnover from 31 December to 1 January through the ISS windows. It is a far cry from the beginning of 2004, a year since the tragic loss of Columbia, when construction of the multi-national station had stalled and only a two-man caretaker crew was aboard to keep its systems operational. Yet New Year's Day 2004 began with new hope for the future expansion of the ISS, as Expedition 8 Commander Mike Foale-British-born, like Tim Peake, yet also holding U.S. nationality and flying in the capacity of a NASA astronaut-delivered a ""Status of the Station"" message, looking ahead to future activities and more distant space exploration. After some quiet celebratory and reflective time, Foale and his Russian crewmate Aleksandr Kaleri returned to a full plate of work: the former participating in ongoing research with cell-culture growth studies in a bioreactor and the latter tending to intermittent problems with Elektron oxygen generators. Twelve months later, Expedition 10's Leroy Chiao and Salizhan Sharipov looked earnestly for Earthly fireworks from their orbital perch, then rang in the New Year in response to Mission Control's special rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne,"" before plunging into a hectic program of biomedical and neurovestibular experiments. By the start of 2006, with Expedition 12 crewmen Bill McArthur and Valeri Tokarev aboard the space station, the shuttle had returned to flight operations, with an anticipated resumption of construction work expected that same year. Sunita Williams became the first American woman to spend New Year in space. Photo Credit: NASA And resume it did, for January 2007 saw Expedition 14 increased to a full strength of three members-with Commander Mike Lopez-Alegria joined by Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin and NASA's Suni Williams, the first American woman to celebrate a New Year in space-and physically expanded with new solar arrays and trusses. Although the first week was spent unpacking supplies and installing an oxygen generation system activation kit in the station's Destiny lab, the crew enjoyed the New Year. In one of her journals, Williams wrote that the close proximity between New Year's Day and Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January created an excuse for much merriment. ""Not sure if you all knew this,"" she explained, ""but the New Year is really a big holiday in Russia and then comes Christmas ... as per the Russian Orthodox Church Calendar. We are going to watch a classic Russian New Year's movie this evening, called Irony of Fate."" This movie, first released in 1975, mixes screwball comedy with a love story and is traditionally broadcast throughout Russia and many of the former Soviet states every New Year's Day. Another woman was aboard the ISS for the following 1 January in 2008, as Peggy Whitson became the first female commander of the station. Alongside Expedition 16 crewmates Yuri Malenchenko and Dan Tani, she had recently welcomed the new Harmony node and the trio spent much of the day off-duty. Having said this, Whitson and Tani began the New Year with daily readings of sleep experiment data and Malenchenko worked on the environmental control system in the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS). A year later, in January 2009, another American woman, Sandy Magnus, was aboard the station, with Expedition 18 comrades Mike Fincke and Yuri Lonchakov. By New Year's Day 2010, the events were turning in busy affairs, since the ISS had reached the capability to house a full crew of up to six long-duration occupants. Soichi Noguchi's arrival aboard Soyuz TMA-18 in December 2009 to join Expedition 22 made him the first Japanese astronaut to spend New Year in space, whilst Italy also added its name to the tally in December 2010, when Paolo Nespoli launched aboard Soyuz TMA-20, alongside Russian cosmonaut Dmitri Kondratiev and NASA astronaut Catherine ""Cady"" Coleman. Upon docking, they joined incumbent Expedition 26 crew members Scott Kelly, Aleksandr Kaleri-spending his third New Year in orbit, following previous holiday stints aboard the ISS and Mir-and Oleg Skripochka. ""The holidays are a time where we treasure being with our family and our friends,"" said Coleman, in a pre-recorded message in the station's Japanese-built Kibo lab, as she floated alongside Kelly and Nespoli, ""and we think about what we have and how much more we have than others do."" Nespoli added that from his vantage point, he saw just one planet and one world, with no borders, and his awareness of the enormity of mankind's responsibility was clear. At the end of 2011, a Dutchman-Expedition 30's Andre Kuipers-added his name to the list of nations whose citizens have rang in the New Year on-orbit. To commemorate the historic event, Kuipers offered his best wishes in his native language on a televised message from the station. And in December 2012, the arrival of Chris Hadfield made Canada the newest member of ""the club."" New Year's Day 2014 saw six men from Russia, the United States, and Japan celebrating the year-end rollover, whilst 1 January 2015 saw two women in space at the same time. Russia's Yelena Serova and Italy's first female spacefarer, Samantha Cristoforetti, were midway through their respective six-month stays aboard the multi-national outpost. However, few can hide the reality that being absent from family and friends at such special times of the year is difficult, even in the splendid isolation of the space station, whose views of the Home Planet are electrifying in their scope and breathtaking in their beauty. ""My collateral damage toll,"" wrote Expedition 30's Don Pettit in a NASA blog, ""includes being on-orbit for two Thanksgivings, Christmas, New Year, birthdays, anniversaries, a science fair, school plays, recitals, and Valentine's Day."" With his most recent mission-which ended on 1 July 2012 after 6.5 months-Pettit's toll was steadily rising, although he acquiesced that ""with our new internet capability on space station, I can at least send flowers!"" He offered the tongue-in-cheek remark in his blog that the real essentials for surviving in the new ""wilderness"" of space ""are not flint, steel, and powder ... but your credit card number and network login."" Since the dawn of the Space Age, and including the six-strong Expedition 50 crew, currently aboard the ISS, no fewer than 84 astronauts and cosmonauts have (or will have) spent New Year away from their loved ones, high above Earth. Among their number are Americans and Russians, as well as a German, two Japanese, two Italians, one Dutchmen, a single Canadian, and a lone Briton. Sixteen people, including two Americans-Don Pettit and Scott Kelly-have spent two New Years aloft and a trio of intrepid Russians-Sergei Avdeyev, Sergei Krikalev, and Aleksandr Kaleri-have watched through station windows for Earthbound fireworks on no fewer than three occasions. Aboard Expedition 50, Peggy Whitson becomes the first woman to have logged two New Years in space. The six-strong Expedition 50 crew of the International Space Station (ISS) were the only humans away from the Home Planet on New Year's Day. Photo Credit: NASA/Twitter Yet there have been other occasions on which missions almost took place over the holiday period. At no stage in its three decades of operational service did a member of America's space shuttle fleet ever bridge the gulf between the end of one year and the dawn of the next, but in June 2006 NASA began to take steps to at least make it technically possible to do so. Historically, the overarching concern was that the orbiter's 1970s-era General Purpose Computers (GPCs)-both primary and critical backup suites-would need to be reset during the so-called Year-End Rollover (YERO) and this could introduce avionics glitches, a temporary loss of controllability, an absence of navigational updates, and no payload support. More fundamentally, overtime costs associated with personnel running shuttle operations over the New Year transition were predicted to run into the millions of dollars. One of the first missions significantly impaired by the limitations of YERO was STS-116, originally scheduled for a mid-December 2006 launch, whose ""window"" to reach the ISS had already been shortened by a so-called ""beta-angle cutout,"" caused by thermal constraints related to the plane of the space station's orbit with the Sun. It was determined at the time that if a YERO work-around was not possible, STS-116 (baselined as a 12-day flight) would be restricted to an exceptionally short, three-day launch window from 14-16 December. Bearing in mind the need for two additional contingency days, to support weather wave-offs, this would produce a landing well in advance of New Year's Eve. If none of the mid-December launch dates could be met, however, the beta-angle issue would have forced a delay until at least the middle of January 2007. Evaluations in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) offered some scope to understand how the orbiter's computers might respond to a YERO event, and initial troubleshooting of the main difficulties was completed by the end of October 2006. The STS-116 launch window was extended slightly from 7-17 December, but NASA managers remained unprepared to impose additional risk on an already complex mission. As circumstances transpired, shuttle Discovery roared into orbit on 9 December and returned safely to Earth after 13 days, well before Christmas and the New Year. Still, in February 2007, a flight software modification to provide a ""YERO Reset"" to GMT Day 001 and a recycling of ground systems was approved by NASA and the issue was declared closed. YERO briefly reared its head again in late 2007, when delays to the STS-122 launch made a New Year mission a possibility, but the mission eventually flew in February 2008. None of the year-end missions in the twilight of shuttle operations-STS-126 in November 2008, STS-129 in November 2009, and STS-133, originally scheduled for November 2010, but postponed until early in the following spring-came into conflict with any of the YERO concerns. Now, more than five years after the final shuttle flight, the combined crew of Expedition 50 will have had ample opportunity over the New Year period to reflect upon their time in the most extraordinary environment ever explored by humans. There was time to look out for fireworks around the world, during their ""Fifteen Midnights,"" and there was time to speak privately to their families. And therein lies the greatest difficulty. Four New Years ago, U.S. astronaut Kevin Ford was at the helm of the station, commanding Expedition 34. ""Probably the biggest thing is asking forgiveness from our families,"" he said in a pre-flight interview, ""but they know how special it is, how long we've waited to do this kind of thing and they'll forgive us this one time around. When New Year rolls around, I'm going to do my best to be well rested and try to see some fireworks as we pass through those midnight time zones around the planet and see if we can pick up any of that from space."" This is part of a series of history articles, which will appear each weekend, barring any major news stories. Next week's article will focus on the 20th anniversary of STS-81, which docked and exchanged crew members aboard the Russian Mir space station in January 1997.

2431660507,"Crunch Network It's The Jons 2016! Posted 10 seconds ago by Jon Evans (@rezendi), Columnist 0

SHARES Happy New Year! 2016 was ... well, we will not soon forget it. Brexit; Trump; the Grim Reaper's celebrity killing spree; and, on the upside, a lot of magnificent tech achievements and breakthroughs. But The Jons are not about that. The Jons, an annual award named (in an awe-inspiring fit of humility) after myself, go to tech's more dubious achievers. And hoo boy were there a lot of those this year. And so, with no further ado: the second annual Jon Awards For Dubious Technical Achievement! THE YES THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BAD PUBLICITY AWARD FOR SPONTANEOUS BRAND COMBUSTION To Samsung, whose Galaxy Note 7 phablet was called out by name before every single flight I took for months, for fear that one would explode and kill us all. You'd think you couldn't even pay for such publicity. Turns out you can, but it'll cost you nearly $20 billion. THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS AWARD FOR REALITY DISTORTION FIELD DISRUPTION To that nasty John Carreyrou, who just wouldn't stop picking on poor victimized Theranos, which, as a direct result, is now basically dead. Doesn't he know that truth doesn't matter any more in our post-factual world? They believed their technology worked. Or, I mean, at least they hoped it did. Or would. One day. Shouldn't that be all that matters? It's only blood tests, after all. THE MINISTRY OF PEACE AWARD FOR IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH To Julian Assange, for his transition from a self-proclaimed ""we open governments"" anti-authoritarian crusader to the (figure)head of an organization that literally reposts Russian press releases. O Julian, Julian, wherefore art thou, Julian? THE YOU DON'T KNOW JACK AWARD FOR PREMATURE FORCED OBSOLESCENCE To Apple, of course, for eliminating the headphone jack from the iPhone; killing MagSafe in favor of USB-C on new MacBooks; and then refusing to supply any other ports on those MacBooks, meaning that, remarkably, that if you go to an Apple Store and buy a new iPhone and a new MacBook, you cannot plug the former directly into the latter. THE DIE DAMN YOU WHY WON'T YOU DIE FREDDY JASON TERMINATOR AWARD FOR PIGHEADEDLY CONTINUING TO EXIST To Bitcoin, which has been pronounced dead more times than Michael Myers, and yet somehow still keeps lumbering along, slowly, crudely, and seemingly unstoppably. THE BROGAN BAMBROGAN AWARD FOR BEING BROGAN BAMBROGAN IN THE BROGAN BAMBROGAN SCANDAL This story had all the allegations: a hangman's noose! A VC tripling the salary of a PR rep after starting to date her! The sacrifice of great technology on the altars of marketing and self-promotion! Counter-allegations of toxic misconduct and abusive behavior! Alas, the lawsuits were settled without trial. But still. Brogan BamBrogan! THE PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE BLOCKCHAIN! AWARD FOR CONNING THE TECHNICALLY INEPT To Craig Wright, for briefly half-convincing people who should have known better that he is ""Satoshi Nakamoti,"" Bitcoin's creator (he isn't) and provoking this incredibly long, incredibly credulous, incredibly cringeworthy London Review Of Books piece by someone who's clearly never written a line of code in his life. Don't read it: read Sarah Jeong's hilariously barbed Twitter takedown of it.

THE BUT REALLY, WHAT IS TRUTH ANYWAYS AWARD FOR RESPONDING TO FAKE NEWS WITH ONTOLOGICAL DEFIANCE To Facebook's PR team, who, desperate to disavow any responsibility for widespread American belief in so so much ludicrous bullshit, literally asked a journalist that:

https://mobile.twitter.com/nelliebowles/status/798655906904870912 THE YOU SOUNDED LIKE AN IDIOT EVEN BEFORE YOU ADDED THE WORD CYBER AWARD FOR BELIEF IN CYBER BOOGEYMEN UNDER THE CYBER BED To the San Bernardino District Attorney's office, for claiming that the infamous iPhone 5c used by mass murderer Syed Farook had to be unlocked for fear that it contained a ""lying-dormant cyber pathogen"" that might attack American infrastructure. They are more likely to find Amelia Earhart on that phone than this. https://t.co/IuwvmdqcpL - Jon Evans (@rezendi) March 4, 2016 THE ONLY NINETY MORE MAGIKARP TO GO BEFORE I CAN EVOLVE A GYARADOS AWARD FOR BRIEFLY DIVORCING WHAT FELT LIKE HALF THE PLANET FROM REALITY IN FAVOR OF VIRTUAL JACKBOOTED EXPLOITATION To Pokémon Go, of course, the release of which prompted many millions to stampede through cities seeking to ambush and brutally imprison helpless, innocent virtual creatures who, after being forced to savagely fight one another in vicious Thunderdome-like arenas, are ultimately transferred to a mysterious ""professor"" who will doubtless perform unspeakable experiments on them. All of which is clearly laying the cultural groundwork for the autocracies to come. Fight the fascism! (And kindly overlook the fact that I'm midway through level 24 myself, and have evolved at least one Gyarados.) THE IF YOU KEEP WIPING AT LEAST SOME OF THAT EGG MIGHT COME OFF YOUR FACE AWARD FOR PRIDE GOING BEFORE A VERY HUMPTY-DUMPTY-LIKE FALL To the creators and investors in ""The DAO,"" who put $150 million into a ""distributed autonomous organization"" built atop Ethereum's blockchain, amid much fanfare and claims of inviolable, unstoppable software. After the DAO was (as I warned) hacked and its money siphoned out, though, it was remarkable how fast the very same people who until then had trumpeted ""irrefutable computer code ... not influenced by outside forces ... not controlled by its creators"" switched to calling for the intervention of creators and outside forces to repair the damage caused by the code. So much for the courage of one's convictions! THE SECURITY BY NOT LETTING THE LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING AWARD FOR KEEPING YOUR USERS MAXIMALLY UNSAFE To Yahoo!, who didn't just discover this year that they'd suffered two separate userinfo hacks, one for half a billion users and one for a whole cool B; they also installed a not-unlike-a-rootkit tool to scan incoming emails at the NSA's behest - which would be bad enough - but best of all, they apparently did this without telling their security team. Wow. Congratulations, of a sort, to the winners of the Jons! All recipients shall receive a bobblehead of myself made up as a Blue Man, as per the image on this post,1 which will doubtless become coveted and increasingly valuable collectibles. And, of course, all winners shall be remembered by posterity forevermore. 1Bobbleheads shall only be distributed if and when available and convenient. The eventual existence of said bobbleheads is not guaranteed or indeed even particularly likely. Not valid on days named after Norse or Roman gods. 0

"
2431660649,"Once a week around this time, my daughter and I usually give out donated books at the Glendale winter homeless shelter.

We love being the Book Ladies. We aren't social workers; we're just volunteers. We don't ask how the people landed in the shelter. Our conversations with them revolve around authors and novels and book requests. In that respect, the homeless in Glendale are as varied as any other group of people. Anne Rice was big last year, as was Tolkien. This year, however, we won't be handing out books because Glendale, a city of more than 200,000, has not managed to arrange for a 2016-17 shelter for its homeless.

I don't fault Ascensia, the nonprofit that runs Glendale's homeless programs. It is an excellent, hardworking organization, doing the best it can. As recently as a few weeks ago, when I called to find out where the shelter would be this year, the staff were still optimistic about pulling together a temporary winter space.

But it didn't happen. A shelter with strict, punishing rules is better than no shelter at all. There are plenty of reasons why not. One is the difficulty of finding staff with the skills to deal with men and women who may be suffering from untreated mental illnesses, emotional issues and addiction in a potentially volatile setting, for very little pay.

An even bigger challenge is finding a site. Ascensia believes that serving 80 people humanely requires 10,000 square feet. There must also be an adequate number of toilets and showers, tolerant neighbors and a landlord kind enough to rent cheap for less than a year.

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, the county and city agency that coordinates L.A.'s homeless efforts, will reimburse the shelter $23 per person per night. When all the other costs are factored in, that's not enough to cover Glendale's commercial rental prices.

A few generous, wealthy Glendalians could swan in and cover the entire cost, of course, as so many public ills could be cured. But barring such compassionate heroics, you'd think the cost could be shared among the rest of us. Surely we could all pitch in to provide the shelter needed to keep people from dying on the streets. That, according to Natalie Komuro, executive director of Ascencia, is the shelter's primary purpose.

I don't scoop up homeless strangers and bring them to live in my spare bedroom, and I don't expect anyone else to do that either. But as a community, a civilized society, I think we should take care of those in need.

Some folks believe the homeless bring their plight upon themselves and if their troubles aren't our fault, they also aren't our problem. Some believe the homeless have chosen a ""lifestyle"" that's an easy out. But it sure doesn't look easy to me. Last year, the winter shelter housed from 100 to 130 people a night in a warehouse near the train station. It was first come, first served, so sometimes, if you didn't line up in time, you were turned away. One night, 36 people began lining up at 4 p.m. instead of 4:30. That half-hour was apparently too much for the people in the surrounding buildings.

I don't know how many of them called the city, and I don't know how they worded their complaints. Maybe they looked out their windows and got scared, or they worried they would lose business, or they were just grossed out.

Whatever the case, it got results. Glendale officials insisted that the early birds be barred from entering the shelter that night. No dinner. No bathroom. No cot. The city's position was that spending the night on the street would teach the early arrivers not to be early again.

The on-site director begged the city for mercy but she was denied. Then it fell to her to carry out the punishment she considered gratuitously cruel. When my daughter and I rolled in with our books we found the staff fighting tears and the remaining guests distraught. Thirty-six women and men had been turned away. It hadn't been a crowded night so their 36 dinners went uneaten and 36 cots stood empty.

As unconscionable as that was last year, this is worse. A shelter with strict, punishing rules is better than no shelter at all.

I am ashamed of my city.

""Let me tell you why the Moon is an amazing place. It's an amazing place, believe me. And we're gonna go back there, to the Moon."" OK, so we're probably not going to hear a JFK-style inspiring commitment from incoming President Trump about prioritising Moon bases or similar, but one thing is clear; the direction of space exploration is up for grabs.With a few milestone tests for SpaceX, 2017 is going to be a big year in the space industry, but there are plenty of landmark celestial events, too. The biggest one of all has to be the Great American Eclipse on August 21, when millions of people in the USA will drive north to witness two minutes of darkness in the day and a chance to gape in aw at the Sun's icy white corona. Will Instagram survive?

January 20, 2017: Trump on the Moon?

Will Trump go to the Moon?
There are reasons to believe that President Trump is keeping an ambitious space project under his Make America Great Again hat, possibly for his inauguration speech on Friday, January 20, 2017. If Trump - who will appoint a new NASA Administrator during 2017 - decides to commit to returning to the Moon, it will mean an about-turn at NASA, which has been on its #JourneyToMarsfor the last few years. Would that leave Mars to be privately colonised by Elon Musk's SpaceX?

February 26, 2017: Annular Solar Eclipse

Argentina will get a Ring of Fire eclipse
They call it the Ring of Fire eclipse. A quirk of nature means that while the Sun is 400 times larger in diameter than the Moon, it's also 400 times further away, so both Sun and Moon appear to be exactly the same size in the sky. Hence a New Moon can eclipse the Sun and turn day into night for a few minutes However, on Sunday 26 February, 2017 at 14:58 Universal Time (GMT), the Moon will be at the furthest point from the Earth in its elliptical orbit, so will cover most, but not all, of the Sun, creating a Ring of Fire eclipse. 

Total darkness doesn't occur during an annular eclipse, and solar safety eclipse glasses must be worn. Oh, and you'll need to be in Patagonia, Argentina or Angola to see it. There was one last September across Africa.

March 27, 2017: Launch of ISS crew

A Soyuz MS-04 rocket prepares for take-off
Humans making low-Earth orbit their permanent home is perhaps the greatest achievement of our generation, but the International Space Station often gets overlooked. The end of March will see the first of four ISS crew lift-offs in 2017 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad in Kazakhstan. There are few better space spectacles than the launch of a Soyuz MS-04 rocket. You can watch it all live on NASA TV, or visit the Baikonur Cosmodrome - the world's first and busiest cosmodrome - for a mere US$4,500. High-def TV of Earth from the ISS is frequently available, and if you want to see the ISS speed across the sky from your back yard, NASA's Spot The Station service is on hand.

April 7, 2017: Jupiter at Opposition 

NASA's Juno spacecraft at Jupiter
The giant planet swings into view this month as it reaches what astronomers call 'opposition'. All that means is that Earth has orbited into a position exactly between the Sun and Jupiter, so the planet is at its brightest and best of the year. With a pair of binoculars is possible to study the fifth planet from the Sun and even see the largest of its moons - Europa, Ganymede, Callisto and Io - as pinpricks of light lining-up around Jupiter. That stunning site is even more impressive through any telescope; even a 4-inch 'scope will reveal its iconic red stripes. NASA's Juno probe is currently taking our closest-ever look.

June 15, 2017: Saturn at Opposition

Saturn is at its brightest during June
While Jupiter is certainly a stunning site through binoculars or a telescope, perhaps the most amazing night sky object of all for amateur astronomers is the planet Saturn, which this month swings into opposition. Magnification is important here, but even in a cheap 4-inch or 6-inch telescope you'll see the hallowed rings of Saturn with your own eyes. Seriously, this is one thing everyone should see once during their lifetime.

August 12/13, 2017: Perseids Meteor Shower

August sees a spectacular meteor shower
Time for fireballs! The Perseids meteor shower is the most prolific of the year, and the result of Earth busting through debris from a comet called Comet Swift-Tuttle, which passed through the solar system most recently in 1992. We're talking about 50-100 or more meteors per hour, with big, bright, sparkling fireballs that often appear to leave a trail behind them. Instead of a fraction of a second, each shooting star can last a full second.The spectacle of seeing three bright meteors streak across the sky is price-less but demands patience, so avoid the temptation to check your smartphone, which will distract you and instantly kill your night vision. Between midnight and 2am, when the night sky is darkest, is the very best time.

August 21, 2017: Total Solar Eclipse, USA

Where will you be for the Great American Eclipse?
They're calling it Black Monday. For around two minutes on the morning of Monday, 21 August 2017, a narrow swath of the USA will go dark, as the Sun fully disappears behind the New Moon. This rare Total Solar Eclipse will be visible only from a narrow 70-mile band stretching from Oregon to South Carolina, known as the path of Totality. If you want to go, make your plans now. Just before totality, red spots pulse on the edge of the Moon, the last rays of sunlight pouring through the valleys of the Moon, before all sunlight is blocked. You then get to see the Sun as it really is, its bright star-white corona billowing in deep space like ribbons blowing in the wind. As Totality ends, the first rays of Sun cause a powerful one-second flash; the Diamond Ring, surely the most beautiful natural phenomenon of all. Will the internet survive the inevitable onslaught of #eclipselfies?

August 2017: SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon

Will SpaceX soon send astronauts to the ISS? 
NASA's reliance on Russian space agency Roscosmos for sending its astronauts into space, which charges US$81 million for a return ticket to the ISS on a Soyuz, will only end if either SpaceX or Boeing successfully test their crew capsules. While tests of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner have been delayed until 2018, SpaceX will launch an unmanned version of Crew Dragon during August 2017. The goal is a 14-day manned mission to the ISS in 2018. SpaceX will follow it up in September with the first-ever launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, which is designed to go to Mars.

Sept 15, 2017: NASA's Cassini will crash into Saturn

Cassini is scheduled to smash into Saturn

NASA's Cassini probe at Saturn has made a play for humankind's most-loved robot since it arrived at Saturn in 2004. It has discovered icy plumes on moon Enceladus, taken jaw-dropping images of Saturn, and its probe Huygens landed on the moon Titan where it discovered lakes of methane. All good things must come to and end, however, and after a year spent taking deep dives towards the planetary surface, Cassini will end its 12 year-long mission by crashing into the planet on September 15.

December 3, 2017: Full Moon & Supermoon

Yet another Supermoon?! 
Supermoons are nerdy events, but the internet loves them. The Moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical so sometimes it's closer than usual; that's all a Supermoon is. It looks slightly bigger than normal, but only by a few percent, so what's the fuss? However, it is a great excuse to witness a bright orange moon-rise, which few people ever see. Get somewhere high - a couple of storeys up will do - and look directly east. Unless it's cloudy, a bright orange Moon will appear on the horizon. It will look awesome because the rising Full Moon always looks awesome, but it will really only appear to be larger when it's just above the horizon. The key time is sunset on December 3, 2017, for about 25 minutes.
If you miss it, just wait 28 days.

Sky Maps and Video Guides Best Night Sky Events of January 2017 (Stargazing Maps)

See what's up in the night sky for January 2017, including stargazing events and the moon's phases, in this Space.com gallery courtesy of Starry Night Software. Moon Phases Thursday, January 5 at 2:47 p.m. EST - First Quarter Moon At first quarter, the positions of the Earth, sun, and moon cause us to see one-half of the moon illuminated by the sun. The moon's bright half is on the western (right-hand) side - toward the setting sun. It rises around noontime and sets around midnight, so the moon is visible half the time by day - in the afternoon hours - and the other half at night, during the evening hours. The name quarter moon, even though it's really a ""half-moon"" shape, refers to the fact that, starting from new moon, our natural satellite has now completely the first quarter of its orbital journey around Earth. Thursday, January 12 at 6:34 a.m. EST - Full Wolf Moon The January full moon, known as the Wolf Moon, Old Moon, or Moon after Yule, always shines in or near the stars of Gemini. It rises around sunset and sets around sunrise. The January moon reaches full phase on Thursday morning, so it will appear full on both Wednesday and Thursday evening. This is the only night in the month when the moon is in the sky all night long. The rest of the month, the moon spends at least some time in the daytime sky. Thursday, January 19 at 5:13 p.m. EST - Last Quarter Moon After full phase, the moon is now waning, illuminated less every evening. At last quarter the moon rises around midnight and sets near noon. Morning commuters might take note of it, shining high in the south against the blue daytime sky. The bright half is now on the left-hand side, towards the eastern dawning sun. At last quarter, the moon is positioned ahead of the Earth in our trip around the sun. When you see it in the sky, keep in mind that about 3½ hours later, earth will occupy the same point in space where the moon is now. After last quarter, the moon begins to traverse the last quarter of its orbit in its trip around the earth as it approaches new moon. Friday, January 27 at 7:07 p.m. EST - New Moon The moon's orbit carries it between the earth and sun and sits in the same region of the sky where the sun is. Sunlight is only reaching the side of the moon that is turned away from us, so as a consequence it cannot be seen. Due to the moon's tilted orbit, it usually passes above or below the sun, instead of eclipsing the sun. Starting a day or two after new moon, you might catch a glimpse of the slender sliver of a waxing crescent moon low near the western horizon, as it gradually pulls away from the sun's vicinity and shifts toward the east. Observing Highlights Sunday, January 1 evening - See Mars and Neptune in your telescope Around 2 am Eastern Standard Time on Sunday, January 1st, Mars will pass very close to Neptune, and they'll both easily fit into the field of view of a small telescope's eyepiece. For observers in eastern North America, the two planets will set while Mars is still 8 arc-minutes below Neptune - still a very tight telescopic grouping. Hawaiians will see the planets' closest separation of only 1 arc-minute (1/30th of the moon's diameter). Monday, January 2 evening - Crescent Moon between Venus and Mars In the western sky after sunset on Monday, January 2, the crescent moon will form a line with Venus and Mars, sitting 8 degrees to the upper left of bright Venus, and 4 degrees to the lower right of dim Mars. Venus sets first about 8:45 pm local time. Tuesday-Wednesday, January 3-4 midnight to dawn - Quadrantid Meteor Shower The annual Quadrantid meteor shower runs from Dec 30th to Jan 12th. One of the most reliable in the year, it peaks on the morning of January 4, so the best times to observe will be between midnight and dawn that morning. The moon will be a waxing crescent on the peak dates, producing a darker sky and a better show! Thursday, January 12 evening - Venus at Greatest Eastern Elongation On the evening of Thursday, Jan 12th, Venus will reach its widest separation east of the Sun. On that evening, it will reach its highest point in the night sky, allowing us to view it with the least amount of turbulence caused by the Earth's atmosphere. As a bonus, Venus will also be located less than 23 arc-minutes to the upper right of Neptune. Both planets should fit nicely into the field of view of a low power eyepiece in a small telescope. Venus will exhibit a half phase. Saturday, January 14 evening - Moon meets Regulus In the eastern sky, on the evening of Saturday, January 14, the waning gibbous moon will sit near the naked eye star Regulus in Leo. Minimum separation occurs about 10 pm EST, when the moon is only 2 degrees to the lower right of the star. Observers in southern South America will see the moon occult Regulus. Tuesday, January 17 evening - Asteroid Vesta at Opposition On Tuesday, January 17, the large asteroid Vesta reaches opposition, the date when it is closest to earth and brightest. At apparent magnitude 6.1, it is observable with naked eyes, binoculars, and small telescopes. Its motion through the background stars can be seen by observing it on separate evenings (shown here from Nov 1, 2016 to Mar 5, 2017). Thursday, January 19 after 1 am - Moon meets Jupiter In the eastern sky from 12:30 am local time to dawn on Thursday, January 19, the last quarter moon will sit about 2 degrees north (to the upper left) of Jupiter. Both bright objects will be easy to see with naked eyes. Thursday, January 19 before dawn - Mercury at Greatest Western Elongation On Thursday, Jan 19, before dawn, Mercury will reach its greatest angle west of the sun. Through most of January, the planet is observable in the eastern sky for about an hour before sunrise. With Mercury near a shallow ecliptic, this apparition is less than ideal for northern hemisphere observers, but quite good from the southern hemisphere. Tuesday, January 24 pre-dawn - Old Moon meets Saturn In late January, the ringed planet Saturn will be sitting very low in the southeastern sky before dawn. On Tuesday, January 24, the old crescent Moon will sit only 3 degrees northeast (to the upper left) of the planet. The best viewing times are between 5:45 and 6:45 am local time. Mercury will be located some 16 degrees to the lower left of them. Tuesday, January 31 evening - Moon, Mars, and Venus On the evening of Tuesday, January 31, the waxing crescent moon will form a tight triangle with Mars and Venus in the southwestern evening sky, easily fitting into a binocular field of view. Keep an eye out for the earthshine illuminating the moon's darkened disk. Planets Mercury spends January in a morning apparition. This is a poor one for northern hemisphere observers due to the shallow ecliptic, but a good one for southern hemisphere viewers. Its visibility worldwide improves as the planet swings wider of the sun until January 19 when it reaches greatest western elongation. Then it begins to swing sunwards again. During the month, while its disk diameter decreases, it brightens and waxes from a slim crescent to a nearly full disk. The waning crescent moon lands 6 degrees to the east of Mercury on January 26. Venus has been gracing the western evening sky for months. For most of January, it traverses the stars of Aquarius. On the evening of Thursday, Jan 12th, Venus will reach its widest angle east of the Sun. That evening, it will reach its highest point in the night sky, allowing us to view it with the least amount of distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere. As a bonus, Venus will also be located less than 23 arc-minutes to the upper right of Neptune. Both planets should fit nicely into the field of view of a low power eyepiece in a small telescope. On the evening of Saturday, Jan 14th, Venus will exhibit an exactly half-illuminated phase, similar in shape to a first quarter Moon. Strong binoculars might hint at the asymmetry, but a small telescope will definitely show it. Around the time of greatest eastern elongation, Venus is heading straight towards the Earth. So it will be growing in disk diameter and brightening as we close the distance between us. After sunset on January 1 and 2, the young crescent Moon will pass to the north of Venus, sitting 5.5 degrees northwest (to the lower right) of Venus on the 1st and 6.5 degrees east (to the upper left) of Venus on the 2nd. On Jan 31st, the moon returns to form a tight triangle with Venus and Mars. Throughout January, Mars holds its place as an easily visible reddish object in the evening southwestern sky, setting at 9:50 pm local time. At 2 am Eastern Standard Time on Sunday, January 1st, Mars will pass within only 1 arc-minute (1/30th of the moon's diameter) of Neptune, and they'll both easily fit into the field of view of a telescope's eyepiece - a study in blue and red! Even a small telescope will be sufficient to see the two planets at the same time, though Neptune will be 400 times fainter. Observers on the west coast and the Pacific Ocean region will be able to see Mars and Neptune at closest approach. Unfortunately, for eastern North America, the two planets will set about 9:45 pm, while Mars is still 8 arc-minutes below Neptune - still a very tight telescopic grouping. On January 19, its eastward motion carries it from Aquarius and into Pisces. Through the month, it decreases in brightness and disk size as we increase our distance from it. On January 31, the waxing crescent moon will form a tight triangle with Mars and Venus, easily fitting in a binocular field of view. Jupiter, just above the bright star Spica in Virgo all month, rises at 1:15 am on January 1 and sits midway up the southern sky by sunrise. For the last week of January, it rises before midnight. The bright planet is easy to see, even as the sky becomes lighter before sunrise. On the morning of Thursday, January 19, the moon will sit less than 3 degrees north (to the left) of Jupiter. Saturn, in southern Ophiuchus, begins January embedded low in the eastern dawn twilight. Its visibility steadily improves through the month as it climbs away from the sun. On Tuesday, January 24, the old crescent Moon will land only 3 degrees north (to the upper left) of the planet. Throughout January, Uranus is in the southwestern evening sky, in the constellation of Pisces. It's visible from nightfall until late evening. At magnitude 5.8, it is not readily visible with unaided eyes, but binoculars or a small telescope can reveal it as a tiny blue-green dot. Neptune is in the southwestern evening sky in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a very dim, nearly 8th-magnitude object visible only with very good binoculars or a telescope. In early January it is observable from nightfall until 9:30 pm local time, but it sets before 8 pm local time at month's end. At about 2 am Eastern Standard Time on Sunday, January 1st, Mars will pass very close to Neptune, and they'll both easily fit into the field of view of a telescope's eyepiece. For observers in eastern North America, the two planets will set while Mars is still 8 arc-minutes below Neptune, but Hawaiians will see the planets closest pass of only 1 arc-minute (1/30th of the moon's diameter) from one another. Skywatching Terms Asterism: A noteworthy or striking pattern of stars within a larger constellation. Degrees (measuring the sky): The sky is 360 degrees all the way around, which means roughly 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. It's easy to measure distances between objects: Your fist on an outstretched arm covers about 10 degrees of sky, while a finger covers about one degree. Visual Magnitude: This is the astronomer's scale for measuring the brightness of objects in the sky. The dimmest object visible in the night sky under perfectly dark conditions is about magnitude 6.5. Brighter stars are magnitude 2 or 1. The brightest objects get negative numbers. Venus can be as bright as magnitude minus 4.9. The full moon is minus 12.7 and the sun is minus 26.8. Terminator: The boundary on the moon between sunlight and shadow. Zenith: The point in the sky directly overhead. Night Sky Observing Tips Adjust to the dark: If you wish to observe faint objects, such as meteors or dim stars, give your eyes at least 15 minutes to adjust to the darkness. Light Pollution: Even from a big city, one can see the moon, a handful of bright stars and sometimes the brightest planets. But to fully enjoy the heavens - especially a meteor shower, the constellations, or to see the amazing swath across the sky that represents our view toward the center of the Milky Way Galaxy - rural areas are best for night sky viewing. If you're stuck in a city or suburban area, a building can be used to block ambient light (or moonlight) to help reveal fainter objects. If you're in the suburbs, simply turning off outdoor lights can help. Prepare for skywatching: If you plan to be out for more than a few minutes, and it's not a warm summer evening, dress warmer than you think necessary. An hour of observing a winter meteor shower can chill you to the bone. A blanket or lounge chair will prove much more comfortable than standing or sitting in a chair and craning your neck to see overhead. Daytime skywatching: When Venus is visible (that is, not in front of or behind the sun) it can often be spotted during the day. But you'll need to know where to look. A sky map is helpful. When the sun has large sunspots, they can be seen without a telescope. However, it's unsafe to look at the sun without protective eyewear. See our video on how to safely observe the sun, or our safe sunwatching infographic. Further Reading Moon Phases: How the lunar cycle works, from full moon to new moon. Also find out when is the next full moon. Constellations: The history of the Zodiac constellations and their place in night sky observing. Lunar Eclipses: How they work, plus find out when's the next lunar eclipse. Solar Eclipses: How they work, the types, and when the next one occurs.

On January 19, its eastward motion carries it from Aquarius and into Pisces. Through the month, it decreases in brightness and disk size as we increase our distance from it. On January 31, the waxing crescent moon will form a tight triangle with Mars and Venus, easily fitting in a binocular field of view. Venus in January 2017 Credit: Starry Night Venus has been gracing the western evening sky for months. For most of January, it traverses the stars of Aquarius. On the evening of Thursday, Jan 12th, Venus will reach its widest angle east of the Sun. That evening, it will reach its highest point in the night sky, allowing us to view it with the least amount of distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere. As a bonus, Venus will also be located less than 23 arc-minutes to the upper right of Neptune. Both planets should fit nicely into the field of view of a low power eyepiece in a small telescope. On the evening of Saturday, Jan 14th, Venus will exhibit an exactly half-illuminated phase, similar in shape to a first quarter Moon. Strong binoculars might hint at the asymmetry, but a small telescope will definitely show it. Around the time of greatest eastern elongation, Venus is heading straight towards the Earth. So it will be growing in disk diameter and brightening as we close the distance between us. After sunset on January 1 and 2, the young crescent Moon will pass to the north of Venus, sitting 5.5 degrees northwest (to the lower right) of Venus on the 1st and 6.5 degrees east (to the upper left) of Venus on the 2nd. On Jan 31st, the moon returns to form a tight triangle with Venus and Mars. Jupiter in January 2017 Credit: Starry Night Jupiter, just above the bright star Spica in Virgo all month, rises at 1:15 am on January 1 and sits midway up the southern sky by sunrise. For the last week of January, it rises before midnight. The bright planet is easy to see, even as the sky becomes lighter before sunrise. On the morning of Thursday, January 19, the moon will sit less than 3 degrees north (to the left) of Jupiter. Uranus in January 2017 Credit: Starry Night Throughout January, Uranus is in the southwestern evening sky, in the constellation of Pisces. It's visible from nightfall until late evening. At magnitude 5.8, it is not readily visible with unaided eyes, but binoculars or a small telescope can reveal it as a tiny blue-green dot. Saturn in January 2017 Credit: Starry Night Saturn, in southern Ophiuchus, begins January embedded low in the eastern dawn twilight. Its visibility steadily improves through the month as it climbs away from the sun. On Tuesday, January 24, the old crescent Moon will land only 3 degrees north (to the upper left) of the planet. Neptune in January 2017 Credit: Starry Night Neptune is in the southwestern evening sky in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a very dim, nearly 8th-magnitude object visible only with very good binoculars or a telescope. In early January it is observable from nightfall until 9:30 pm local time, but it sets before 8 pm local time at month's end. At about 2 am Eastern Standard Time on Sunday, January 1st, Mars will pass very close to Neptune, and they'll both easily fit into the field of view of a telescope's eyepiece. For observers in eastern North America, the two planets will set while Mars is still 8 arc-minutes below Neptune, but Hawaiians will see the planets closest pass of only 1 arc-minute (1/30th of the moon's diameter) from one another.

2431664549,"As the new year of 2017 kicks off, skywatchers have a fine array of planets to observe in both the evening and morning skies. Brilliant Venus arrives at its greatest angular distance to the east of the sun on Jan. 12, climbing ever higher in the western sky and pulling closer to ocher-hued and much dimmer Mars. Both planets will be in good viewing position until mid-evening. You can also use Mars on New Year's evening to point the way to the most distant planet, Neptune. Normally, one would need a good star chart or atlas to locate this faint, distant, bluish world. But on Jan. 1, it will be situated less than half a full moon's width from much brighter Mars, the closest pairing of any two planets in nearly three decades. [January 2017: The Best Night Sky Events] Jupiter comes above the horizon around the middle of the night and is high toward the south-southeast before sunrise. Saturn lies low in the southeast during morning twilight, and the rocky little world of Mercury is lower, near to the southeast horizon for much of the month. In our schedule, remember that when measuring the angular separation between two celestial objects, your clenched fist held at arm's length measures roughly 10 degrees. We present a schedule below that provides some of the best planet-viewing times and directs you where to look to see them: Mercury will reach its greatest angle west of the sun, known as greatest western elongation, before dawn on Thursday, Jan. 19. Through most of January, the planet is observable in the eastern sky for about an hour before sunrise. With Mercury near a shallow ecliptic, this apparition is less than ideal for northern hemisphere observers, but quite good from the southern hemisphere. Credit: Starry Night Mercury stands at its greatest morning elongation from the sun (24 degrees) on Jan. 19, but the planet actually appears a little higher for midnorthern latitudes the previous week. Even at the end of January, look for a zero-magnitude Mercury low in the southeast about 45 minutes before sunup. About 45 minutes before sunrise on Jan. 25, look very low to the southeast horizon for a narrow sliver of the moon, only 36 hours from new phase. About 5 degrees to its lower left will be Mercury. Binoculars will help you pick out both objects up against the brightening dawn sky. On the evening of Thursday, Jan. 12, Venus will reach its widest separation east of the sun. On that evening, it will reach its highest point in the night sky, allowing us to view it with the least amount of turbulence caused by Earth's atmosphere. As a bonus, Venus will also be located less than 23 arc-minutes to the upper right of Neptune. Both planets should fit nicely into the field of view of a low power eyepiece in a small telescope. Credit: Starry Night Venus: As seen from latitude 40 degrees north, this dazzling planet's altitude a half hour after sunset increases from 30 to 36 degrees between New Year's Day and month's end. Venus is stunning throughout January as the planet brightens from magnitude minus 4.3 to minus 4.6, remaining up for almost 4 hours after sunset. Venus is at greatest elongation, 47 degrees from the sun, on Jan. 12. That is almost, but not precisely, when the planet appears half in the telescope. The appearance, called dichotomy, usually occurs a few days before a greatest evening elongation of the planet. Try to observe the planet telescopically before the sky darkens, when Venus' disk won't dazzle your eye. On the evening of Jan. 2, two planets flank a slender crescent moon in the southwest sky. To the lower left of the moon is Venus, while to the moon's upper left is first-magnitude Mars. On New Year's Day, the reddish planet is 12 degrees to the east (upper left) of Venus; watch the two approach each other during January as they move rapidly against the backdrop of Aquarius and Pisces. On the evening of Jan. 31, Venus and Mars once again interact with a slender crescent moon, this time forming a striking triangle. Earth is closest to the sun for the year at 9 a.m. EST, a distance of 91,404,322 miles (147,100,997 kilometers). Earth is 3.3 percent closer to the sun than it will be when the planet is at aphelion, next July 3. Around 2 a.m. EDT on Sunday, Jan. 1, Mars will pass very close to Neptune, and they'll both easily fit into the field of view of a small telescope's eyepiece. For observers in eastern North America, the two planets will set while Mars is still 8 arc-minutes below Neptune - still a very tight telescopic grouping. Hawaiians will see the planets' closest separation of only 1 arc-minute (1/30th of the moon's diameter). Credit: Starry Night Mars, as noted above, lies near Venus all through January. The two planets remain within 5.5 degrees of each other from Jan. 30 through Feb. 4. That is as close as they will come to each other before Mars pulls away from Venus to the east. The two planets present some interesting contrasts. Their colors are sparkling white and ochre-orange. Increasing in brilliance, Venus outshines Mars by 191 times at month's end; Mars meanwhile, has been dimming. Telescopically, the Red Planet's waxing gibbous disk is tiny in most telescopes, and as it continues to recede from Earth, it continues to slowly shrink. If you have never seen Neptune, the farthest planet in the solar system, you have a very good opportunity on New Year's Day using Mars point the way. You need a dark sky and either good binoculars or a telescope to glimpse bluish Neptune; it sits less than 0.2 degrees to the lower left of Mars, which is about one-third up in the southwest sky. Mars is a full seven magnitudes or 630 times brighter than Neptune. The moon is near Mars on Jan. 2 and again on the Jan. 31. In the eastern sky from 12:30 a.m. local time to dawn on Thursday, Jan. 19, the last quarter moon will sit about 2 degrees north (to the upper left) of Jupiter. Both bright objects will be easy to see with naked eyes. Credit: Starry Night Jupiter comes up around 12:45 a.m. your local time on New Year's Day, around midnight by Jan. 15 and 11 p.m. by month's end, all the while shining with almost twice the brightness of the star Sirius. The lordly planet rises with the much dimmer star Spica located 4 degrees to the gas giant's lower right. Jan. 20 marks the first of three conjunctions in 2017 of Jupiter with Spica. The other two conjunctions come on Feb. 23 and Sept. 5. But the best time to observe Jupiter in a telescope is still around morning twilight, when the planet is highest in the south. Soon after midnight on the morning of the 19th, low in the east-southeast sky, the moon is situated 2 to 3 degrees above and to the left of Jupiter. In late January, the ringed planet Saturn will be sitting very low in the southeastern sky before dawn. On Tuesday, Jan. 24, the old crescent Moon will sit only 3 degrees northeast (to the upper left) of the planet. The best viewing times are between 5:45 and 6:45 am local time. Mercury will be located some 16 degrees to the lower left of them. Credit: Starry Night Saturn, the famed ringed planet, rises 80 minutes before sunup on Jan. 1, and 100 minutes earlier by month's end. It's still ""keeping company"" with Antares, the heart of Scorpius, sitting about a dozen degrees to the left of the star. Golden Saturn is the only bright object in its area of the sky, within the constellation Ophiuchus, and is a little brighter than red Antares. But notice that Antares, being a star, has the greater talent for twinkling. On the morning of Jan. 24, look low toward the southeast about 1 1/2 hours before sunup and you'll see a thin, crescent moon, and sitting 3 degrees to its lower right will be Saturn.

If you support the legalization of marijuana, 2016 didn't give you much to complain about. Last year, residents in four states approved recreational-marijuana ballot initiatives, doubling the total from the end of 2015, while five new states put medical-cannabis laws on their books. By year's end, 28 states and Washington, D.C., had legalized medical pot.

And there's more where that came from. We saw two battleground states -- Pennsylvania and Ohio -- introduce and pass medical-marijuana legislation without sending it to a public vote. We also saw a continued softening in the public's opinion toward marijuana, which remains an illegal drug at the federal level. Gallup's 2016 poll found that 60% of Americans now want to see the substance legalized nationwide, up from just 25% when California passed the first compassionate-use law in 1996. Legal weed sales have also soared. Cannabis research firm ArcView sees sales reaching nearly $22 billion by the end of the decade, while investment firm Cowen & Co. projects a better-than-23% annualized growth rate leading to $50 billion in legal sales by 2026.

California is a medical-marijuana juggernaut

Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, wound up generating $996.2 million in legal sales during 2015, leading to $135 million in tax and licensing revenue. Yet that's peanuts compared with legal pot sales in California, the eighth-largest economy in the world by GDP.

Image source: .

Since passing medical-cannabis legislation in 1996, California has amassed more than 720,000 current patients, at least according to a September 2016 estimate from the Marijuana Policy Project. That's about 1.8% of California's total population as of 2015, and it represents half of all legal medical-marijuana patients in the entire United States.

According to Troy Dayton, the CEO of ArcView, California generated $2.7 billion in medical-cannabis sales in 2015, which amounts to 62% of all medical-cannabis sales in the U.S. in 2015, as well as more than half of all cannabis sales, medical and recreational combined , in 2015. California's medical-marijuana industry is simply enormous.

But it may not stay that way for long.

The cannibalization of medical cannabis

In November, California's residents went to the polls and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 64, which will legalize recreational, adult-use weed for the state's more than 39 million residents. In 2018 alone, California's legal pot sales are expected to climb to $6.6 billion, based on estimates by New Frontier and ArcView.

Image source: Cannabis Culture, Flickr.

However, legalizing recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and up creates a potentially big problem for the United States' largest medical-marijuana industry: Once recreational-marijuana sales are allowed (they'll be rolled out over the next year), the incentive to head to the doctor to get a prescription for medical pot will no longer be there. Not to mention that getting a physician referral takes time and costs money. From physicians to medical dispensaries, there's the possibility that the medical-cannabis industry could be ravaged by the recreational-pot industry.

Medical dispensaries will still be needed for patients younger than age 21, so it's not as if they'd entirely disappear. But it's probable that the medical-marijuana industry in California today will look very different a year or two from now.

The Sacramento Bee points out that some medical-pot clinics are planning to rebrand to broader holistic services in order to keep their clientele. Those services may include acupuncture, chiropractic care, and hypnosis, for example. Medical-marijuana shops are also counting on new consumers who want the guidance of a physician before purchasing pot, even if they're just recreational consumers and not medical-marijuana patients. Marijuana consultations from an experienced pot clinic physician could still translate into profits.

But, admittedly, the future of medical marijuana in California is very uncertain.

Marijuana's clouded future

Beyond just California, the future of marijuana in the U.S. remains somewhat clouded, too.

For instance, the appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be the next attorney general of the United States is a potentially damaging blow to the marijuana industry. Sessions is an ardent opponent of the legalization movement, and even though President-elect Trump has thrown his full support behind medical marijuana, and has suggested that states should retain their right to regulate their pot industry without federal interference, Sessions could roll back some of the leniency instilled during the Obama presidency. While this isn't to say 20 years of progress could be wiped out, it's unlikely that the sledding will get easier with Sessions as attorney general.

Image source: .

We also can't forget that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency declined to reschedule marijuana when given the opportunity this past August. The DEA noted a lack of safety and clinical data, as well as a lack of understanding the chemical properties of marijuana, in its decision to leave the drug classified as Schedule 1. This means pot companies are still primarily forced to deal in cash, as most banks want nothing to do with them, and they continue to face higher corporate income tax rates since they are unable to take normal business deductions. These persistent disadvantages are what make investing in this space so incredibly dangerous.

Even if the incoming administration or the DEA does decide to reschedule marijuana, it doesn't mean things would necessarily get easier. Schedule 2 through Schedule 5 drugs fall under the tight regulation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA would likely implement strict marketing and packaging regulations, oversee all medical grow operations, and require that approved clinical trials be run to prove that medical cannabis treats certain ailments This all translates into big expenses for the medical-pot industry.

While marijuana's state-level expansion has been something to marvel, this remains an industry best watched from the sidelines.

The night sky for the year 2017 busily begins with beautiful planets and shooting stars.

Venus and Mars loiter in the west-southwestern sky after sunset. The vibrant Venus, a spectacular beacon at -4.4 magnitude (very bright) gets more luminous toward January's end, and the dimmer, red Mars at 0.9 magnitude (bright) becomes slightly less bright.

The sliver of a young moon approaches Venus and Mars on Sunday - as the moon will be on Venus' side. On Monday, the slightly thicker moon hangs out between the two planets.

By mid-month, Venus and Mars appear closer by a few degrees in the west-southwestern sky after dusk and may need a cosmic chaperon to keep them apart. In the waning days of January, the far-less-bright Mars and the ebullient Venus are about 5 degrees away from each other.

Jupiter - hanging out near the star Spica in the constellation Virgo - rises in the east at about 1 a.m. now. In the middle of January, the big gassy planet rises just after midnight. At dawn now, it will be high in the south. Jupiter is conspicuous at -1.9 magnitude (quite bright) early in January and -2 magnitude late in the month.

The ringed Saturn rises just ahead of the rising sun by mid-month in the southeast, and the fleet Mercury makes a cameo appearance in the morning sky - also, just ahead of the sun in mid-month - in the east-southeast.

Shooting stars! The Quadrantid meteor shower peaks on Tuesday morning, according to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The official peak occurs during morning daylight hours in the eastern United States, but devoted stargazers here may catch meteors in the hours before sunrise.

Generally, meteors occur when Earth passes through a dusty comet trail. For the Quadrantids, asteroid 2003 EH1 (perhaps a comet, says Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory) probably forged the granular path.

The sun sets at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Jan. 4 here - that's the first 5 p.m. sunset we've seen since Nov. 7. Until Jan. 9, the sun rises here at 7:27 a.m., the latest sunrises of the year, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. New Year's Day offers 9 hours and 30 minutes of official sunlight for the Washington area, but Jan. 31 provides 10 hours and 14 minutes of glorious solar gleam.

THE GLASS UNIVERSEHow the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the StarsBy Dava SobelIllustrated. 324 pp. Viking. $30.

HIDDEN FIGURESThe American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space RaceBy Margot Lee Shetterly346 pp. William Morrow/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99.

I love to discuss science, especially mathematics and physics, in their most abstract forms, far removed from mundane human concerns. I love to riff on the origin of the universe, black holes, space and time. By contrast, I am not at all happy to discuss gender, which is not remotely my area of expertise. My feeling: Let me get on with what I do well, and let others get on with what they do well. Two illuminating recent books manage to convey a similar sentiment, focused on the uninhibited love of science and math, while still gracefully incorporating the thorny topic of women in science. ''The Glass Universe,'' by Dava Sobel, recounts the previously neglected history of the women astronomers at the Harvard College Observatory near the turn of the 20th century, while ''Hidden Figures,'' by Margot Lee Shetterly, does justice to the African-American women mathematicians and engineers at NASA in the mid-20th century.

I was only a little bit more familiar with the history in ''The Glass Universe.'' Here's the (inaccurate) version I learned: Edward Charles Pickering, director of the Harvard College Observatory from 1877 to 1919, hired a gaggle of women, known fondly as Pickering's Harem. Pickering was fed up with the incompetence of his ''computers,'' the common parlance for humans who computed, in this case, crunching the numbers to arrive at astronomical calculations. In frustration, he supposedly shouted to his all-male computers, ''My Scotch maid could do a better job.'' Now maybe the phrasing is impolitic, but that was the version going around. So he fired all the male computers and hired his Scottish maid, Williamina Fleming, who indeed did a better job and for a fraction of the pay. Over time, this story, clearly apocryphal in places, has been sanitized. Reference to the expression ''harem'' is gradually deleted, as though cleansing the past with an antiseptic of the present is good policy.

In the historically accurate version Dava Sobel tells in her careful and detailed style, the past is neither sanitized nor embellished. Guided by a historian's sacred principles, she lets the story emerge from the thorough research she documents. Sobel does not condemn or excuse or flatter or even analyze the characters. She does not interpret the past through the lens of the present. She barely interprets the past at all. Even her language emulates the phrasing of the sources, as though modernizing her account would distract readers, reminding them of the interloper who stands between them and sheer documentation. The result is a far more accurate telling, of course, and a much subtler one.

Pickering is portrayed as an extremely fair character with great respect for his women computers and a lifelong investment in their success. He hired the Scottish Ã©migrÃ© Williamina Fleming, a former teacher, as a maid after her husband abandoned her in a ''delicate condition.'' Recognizing her capabilities, he reassigned her to help at the observatory. Eventually she oversaw the hiring of dozens of women who performed the astronomical calculations. Sobel explains, ''While it would be unseemly, Pickering conceded, to subject a lady to the fatigue, not to mention the cold in winter, of telescope observing, women with a knack for figures could be accommodated in the computing room, where they did a credit to the profession.'' Though to be clear, some of the women defied the barrier of the observatory itself and determinedly spent cold, hard nights turning the metal dome, climbing ladders not meant for ''ladies'' and operating the telescopes. The work was at times physically toilsome and, it has to be admitted, brutally tedious for stretches of unthinkable duration.

The first Ph.D.s in astronomy at Harvard went to women under Pickering's mentorship, and he fought for the advancement of all the women under his charge. Yet he did maintain unequal, gender-based pay conventions. We love to marvel at the paltry sums despite our inability to calibrate for inflation: 25 cents an hour. On this, Sobel includes a perfect passage from a journal in which Williamina Fleming airs apparently her single complaint about Director Pickering, for whom she clearly had warm sentiments. Fleming writes: ''He seems to think that no work is too much or too hard for me, no matter what the responsibility or how long the hours. But let me raise the question of salary and I am immediately told that I receive an excellent salary as women's salaries stand. .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. Does he ever think that I have a home to keep and a family to take care of as well as the men? But I suppose a woman has no claim to such comforts. And this is considered an enlightened age!'' (Bear in mind that the entry was written before women secured the right to vote.) Her salary was $1,500 a year, in contrast with that of the male assistants, who had not been fired in the way I previously thought, but rather garnered $2,500 per year. And later, in frustration over the issue of her meager salary, she confesses, ''I am told that my services are very valuable to the Observatory, but .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. I feel that my work cannot be of much account.''

Don't deride Pickering. He was generous, committed beyond professionalism, fair-minded and, in context, extremely open to progress. His feminism, if I can stretch the political boundaries of the term, was not theoretical. It's unclear if he could have imagined a woman transcending certain barriers. But when he saw talent and accomplishment, he simply recognized those qualities. He wanted to nourish ability, to see credit properly attributed and, above all else, thereby to advance astronomy. Science profited from the contributions of Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Williamina Fleming, Annie Jump Cannon, Cecilia Payne and Antonia Maury. They detected, classified and cataloged several hundred thousand stars and extrapolated crucial discoveries about our universe in the process. The significance of Leavitt's work, as an example, can be recognized in the results of a more publicly acclaimed astronomer. Edwin Hubble leveraged Leavitt's law on the behavior of variable stars to gauge distances to certain nebulae. He was then able to confidently conclude that some smudges in the sky were actually entire galaxies, thereby extending the geography of the universe to millions of light-years. We now ascertain that the observable universe exceeds 90 billion light-years across.

There are, as should be expected, accounts -- very interesting accounts -- of a heavily reinforced glass ceiling and its occasional, wafer-thin cracks in ''The Glass Universe'' (did Dava Sobel intend this pun?), the title a reference to the tens of thousands of fragile photographic glass plates used to capture the stars that migrated across the mound of sky above the observatory. These underpaid women employees were blatantly overworked. But they loved their work. Astronomy was the subject they chose for themselves and their dedication, as conveyed in this book, was beyond reproach. They confronted scarlet fever, ''grippe,'' deafness, loneliness and destitution. Still, they were tenacious, as is well represented in a quotation from Annie Jump Cannon: ''May I be led into a useful, busy life. I am not afraid of work. I long for it.''

Unlike Sobel, Margot Lee Shetterly does not play the austere historian in ''Hidden Figures.'' She is right there at the beginning with evocative memories of her childhood, visiting her father -- an engineer turned climate scientist -- at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. Shetterly says, ''As a child .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. I knew so many African-Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that's just what black folks did.'' She describes the African-American women computers, many of whom she knew, calculating orbital trajectories in the earliest days of NASA, just after the name had been changed from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, NACA.

In this story too, pay inequity shaped lives and families and inherited opportunities. Here too women's colleges played an important role, as did historically black colleges. Here too we hear the anticipated accounts -- again no less outrageous or provocative for their inevitability -- of bias and limits. There are the added humiliations of segregated schools and neighborhoods, designated dining tables and ''colored'' bathrooms, all colluding to tighten the shackles of racism.

Still, neither book is motivated by bitterness. ''Hidden Figures,'' which has also been adapted into a feature film that opens this month, is clearly fueled by pride and admiration, a tender account of genuine transcendence and camaraderie. The story warmly conveys the dignity and refinements of these women. They defied barriers for the privilege of offering their desperately needed technical abilities.

Juxtapose the intellectual status of the women of NASA against the historical context, before the major advances of the civil rights movement, before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The East Area Computing pool, which began hiring women in the 1930s, outgrew the space allocated as it expanded to include hundreds. The dozens of black women engineers and mathematicians (though most of the women were given lesser titles than their qualifications merited, such as ''assistant'' or ''computer'') received a separate room of clacking machines. They were the women of West Area Computing. Integration across gender and race began naturally as people worked together to solve the problems of aeronautics and space travel.

Shetterly says, ''Women .â€ˆ.â€ˆ. had to wield their intellects like a scythe, hacking away against the stubborn underbrush of low expectations.'' Yet they defied low expectations based on gender and race with composure. She says of the most famous West Area computer, Katherine Johnson: ''She didn't close her eyes to the racism that existed; she knew just as well as any other black person the tax levied upon them because of their color. But she didn't feel it in the same way. She wished it away, willed it out of existence inasmuch as her daily life was concerned.'' Katherine Johnson was sent to the Flight Research Division at the pivotal moment that NASA turned to space travel. She performed the essential trajectory calculations that ensured John Glenn's successful boost into orbit by an Atlas rocket. She went on to contribute to the legendary Apollo 11 mission, in particular to the safe return of the astronauts to Earth.

Throughout both books I was struck by the obviousness of the importance of work, either domestic or professional -- the importance of contributing, of choosing a destiny, of being good at something, of participating in history, and the enraging pointlessness of small-minded repressions of a soaring and generous human urge. The women scientists of ''The Glass Universe'' and ''Hidden Figures'' were affected by external social pressures, and yes, that in turn created inevitable internal pressures. But they transcended those forces to commune with space, and thereby redefined themselves and those around them. The authors of these two fine books help us understand the socially transformative power of a defiant dedication to something greater than our mundane human predicament.

2431668742,"1. Get out of debt

If you're starting off 2017 with a credit card balance hanging over your head, it's time to break the cycle of throwing away money on interest charges. The average U.S. household has $5,700 in credit card debt, with 38% of households carrying some type of balance. But the sooner you pay off that debt, the less money you'll wind up spending to eliminate it. Case in point: Paying off a $5,000 balance at 20% interest over three years will cost you roughly $1,700 extra. Pay off that balance in one year's time and you'll save yourself over $1,100 in interest charges.

More From Fool.com

Not sure where to find the cash to pay off that bill? You might try working a side job temporarily, cutting back on certain expenses, or selling items you no longer need. Chipping away at bad debt a little each month is far better than letting that balance fester.

2. Save more money

An estimated 69% of Americans have less than $1,000 in a savings account, while roughly one-third of Americans have zero savings for retirement. If you fall into either category but promised yourself you'd save more money this year, that's a pledge you really want to stick to. One good way to get started is to bank your entire raise -- meaning, figure out how much each paycheck will increase once your raise kicks in, and arrange for that extra money to go directly into a savings or retirement account.

If your year-end or holiday bonus is paid out in 2017, that's money that should also go right into savings. In fact, if you use your bonus to fund your 401(k) up front (as opposed to putting money in from each paycheck throughout the year), you'll get an even greater opportunity to capitalize on compounding and grow your balance.

3. Follow a budget

Do you really know where all of your money goes each month? Without a budget, you'll probably have a hard time tracking your spending and identifying ways to save. In fact, a basic budget -- as in, the type you can create yourself using a spreadsheet -- could save you hundreds of dollars or more over the course of any given year, yet most people are surprisingly resistant when it comes to using a budget. A recent U.S. Bank study reveals that just 41% of Americans follow a household budget, which means most people are missing out on a key opportunity to manage and improve their finances. If you want to get off on the right foot this year, sit down in front of your computer with your bills and bank statements, see what you're spending in total each month, and find ways to lower that number.

4. Spend less

Living below your means is a crucial part of saving money, so once you have your budget in place, take a look at where your income is going and find ways to cut corners. First, study your spending categories and identify those with wiggle room. Your rent, for example, is probably non-negotiable, especially if you're mid-lease. But if you're on a month-to-month agreement, you might consider finding a lower-cost living space.

If you can't or don't want to make big changes to lower your spending, chip away at the smaller stuff -- things like cable, your data plan, leisure, and even groceries. Yes, you do have to eat, but you can take steps to cut your supermarket spending, even if it means passing up your favorite products unless they're on sale or employing a healthy dose of coupon extremism.

Of course, lowering your spending takes serious self-control, so if you need an added push, consider employing the envelope system. Once you have your budget in place, you can put money -- as in, hard, cold cash -- into different envelopes, each representing a specific spending category. If you run out of money in a given category, you're done for the month. It's a pretty archaic system given the digital world we live in, but if willpower isn't your strong suit, it'll help you curb your spending.

Remember, you have the entire year ahead of you to take control of your finances and make changes for the better. Stick out these resolutions, and chances are, you'll be in a much stronger financial position by the time the new year rolls around.

The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Look Up in 2017!

When can you see the planets at their best during 2017? This guide tells you everything you need to know to catch these astronomical sights in the night sky this year. It also tells you when a particular planet might be passing near to another planet or a bright star. Finally, it lists the constellations that each planet will occupy during the course of the year as well as the various circumstances - conjunctions, oppositions and elongations -on this year's schedule.

Mercury

Mercury, as an evening star, appears in the western sky and sets about an hour after sunset. As a morning star, it appears in the eastern sky, rising about an hour before the sun. There must be a clear, unobstructed horizon on these occasions. Mercury usually appears as a bright ""star"" with a yellowish or ochre hue. See it mornings from Jan. 5 to Feb. 14, evenings from March 23 to April 8, mornings from April 29 to June 7, evenings from July 5 to Aug. 17, mornings from Sept. 6 to Sept. 20, evenings from Nov. 2 to Dec. 4 and mornings from Dec. 20 to Dec. 31.

Mercury is brightest and easiest to spot in the evening sky between March 23 and April 8, and brightest and easiest to spot in the morning sky from Sept. 6 to 20.

Credit: NASA/JPL

Venus

Venus, always brilliant and shining with a steady, silvery light, appears in the western sky at dusk from Jan. 1 to March 16, and in the eastern sky at dawn from April 3 through Nov. 13. From mid-February through early May, Venus is visible as a slender crescent through steadily held binoculars and telescopes. Venus is brightest in the evening sky from Jan. 30 through March 1, reaching its greatest brilliance on Feb. 17. Venus is brightest in the morning sky from April 15 through May 14, reaching its greatest brilliance on April 30.

The planet passes to the north of the much-fainter bluish star Regulus (in Leo, the lion) on the morning of Sept. 20; Venus and the star appear low in the east-northeast predawn sky, separated by only half a degree. On the morning of Oct. 5, Venus passes only about one-quarter of a degree north of Mars, the Red Planet appearing only 1/191 as bright. And before disappearing into the bright morning twilight on the morning of Nov. 13, Venus passes only 0.3 degrees north of Jupiter, the two planets making for a striking sight, standing side by side low in the east-southeast sky in the brightening dawn sky.

Mars

Mars, shining like a ""star"" with a yellow-orange hue, can vary considerably in brightness. See it evenings from Jan. 1 through June 6 and mornings from Sept. 11 through Dec. 31. This is an ""off"" year for Mars, as the planet never becomes very bright or conspicuous. It's at aphelion (its farthest point from the Sun) on Oct. 7, when it is 154.9 million miles (249.3 million kilometers) from the sun and an even more distant 235 million miles (378 million km) from the Earth.

Despite this rather gloomy outlook, one should keep in mind that next year brings an exceptional apparition of Mars; in fact, in late July 2018, the Red Planet comes closer to Earth than at any other time since Mars' historically close approach of Aug. 2003. Along with its close approach to Venus on Oct. 5, Mars also teams up with Mercury on the morning of Sept. 16, the two planets coming to within less than one-third of a degree of each other low in the eastern sky.

Jupiter

Jupiter appears quite brilliant, with a silver-white luster. Spot it mornings from Jan. 1 to April 6, evenings from April 7 to Oct. 6 and mornings again from Nov. 13 to Dec. 31. For much of 2017, Jupiter shines like a dazzling, nontwinkling, silvery ""star"" against the relatively dim star background of Virgo, the maiden , eventually crossing into Libra, the scales, on Nov. 15. Jupiter passes well to the north of bluish Spica, the brightest star of Virgo, on Sept. 12.

Brightest in 2017: March 28 to April 19. Jupiter is at opposition to the Sun on April 7. As the planet begins to emerge from out of the bright dawn twilight, Jupiter passes very close to Venus - just one-third of a degree separating them - on Nov. 13.

Saturn

Saturn shines like a yellowish-white ""star"" of moderate brilliance. The famous rings are visible only in a telescope magnifying at least 30 power. They were turned edge-on (or very nearly so) toward Earth through most of 2009 and at times were quite difficult to observe. The rings have now ""opened-up"" spectacularly to skywatchers' view and are at their maximum tilt toward Earth - a Saturnicentric latitude of 26.98 degrees - on Oct. 17. Saturn starts 2017 in the nonzodiacal constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent holder , and then crosses over into Sagittarius, the archer , on Feb. 23. Retrograde motion causes the ringed planet to cross back into Ophiuchus on May 18, where Saturn will remain until it crosses back into Sagittarius on Nov. 18. See it mornings from Jan. 1 to June 14 and evenings from June 15 to Dec. 4.

Brightest in 2017: June 12 to June 17. Saturn is at opposition to the sun on June 15.

Uranus

Uranus can be glimpsed as a naked-eye object by people who are blessed with good eyesight and a clear, dark sky, as well as a forehand knowledge of exactly where to look for the planet. It shines at magnitude +5.7 and can be readily identified with good binoculars. A small telescope may reveal Uranus' tiny, greenish disk. The planet spends 2017 in Pisces. See it evenings from Jan. 1 to March 29, mornings from April 30 to Oct. 18 and evenings again from Oct. 19 to Dec. 31.

Brightest in 2017: Aug. 27 to Dec. 7. Uranus arrives at opposition to the sun on Oct. 19. Mars passes less than 0.6 degrees from Uranus on the evening of Feb. 26, providing a good benchmark for locating this seventh planet from the sun.

Credit: NASA

Neptune

Neptune spends 2017 in the constellation of Aquarius. At a peak magnitude of +7.8, this bluish-hued world is visible only with stargazing binoculars or a telescope. Spot it evenings from Jan. 1 to Feb. 15, mornings from March 18 to Sept. 4 and evenings again from Sept. 5 to Dec. 31.

Brightest in 2017: July 13 to Oct. 28. Opposition is on Sept. 5. On the evening of Jan. 12, you can try to use Venus to guide you to Neptune, when Venus is situated less than 0.4 degrees to the upper right of Neptune. Good binoculars or a small telescope may reveal the solar system's most distant planet, but keep in mind it will be shining about 80,000 times fainter than Venus!

Don't Miss These 14 Must-See Skywatching Events of 2017 Another year of skywatching is upon us, and there's a lot to look forward to in 2017!

Here are some of the more noteworthy sky events that will take place this year, including multiple meteor showers, occultations of bright stars and the first total eclipse of the sun for the United States in nearly four decades. Space.com's Night Sky column will provide more extensive coverage of these events as they draw closer.

Aug. 7 - Partial Eclipse of the Moon This event will be visible exclusively from ""the Old World"" Aug. 7 the Eastern Hemisphere, running from much of Europe and Africa, and east through Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The moon will pass partially through the northern part of the Earth's dark umbra. At maximum (18:20 UT), a dark ""bite"" will appear on the moon's lower limb; roughly one-quarter of the moon's diameter will be immersed in the umbra. But no part of this eclipse will be visible from North America.

Feb. 10 - Penumbral Eclipse of the Moon The full moon will pass very deep into the outer shadow of the Earth, called the penumbra, on Feb. 10. At maximum eclipse (7:43 p.m. EDT, or 0043 GMT Feb. 11), nearly 99 percent of the moon will be immersed in the shadow, resulting in the top half of the moon appearing noticeably shaded or smudged. Europeans will see this happening around the middle of their night. Eastern North America will find the moon well up in the eastern sky; farther west, the darkest phase of the eclipse will occur closer to moonrise. [ See stunning photos of a penumbral lunar eclipse. ]

NEXT: A ring of fire

Feb. 26 - Annular Eclipse of the Sun In an annular eclipse, the dark silhouette of the moon appears ever-so-slightly smaller than the disk of the sun, transforming the sun into a narrow ring of light for up to 44 seconds. The eclipse's narrow path Feb. 26 will start in the South Pacific Ocean at sunrise, cross Patagonia, then sweep across a broad expanse of the South Atlantic Ocean before moving over the African countries of Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A partial solar eclipse of varying extent will be visible from the lower two-thirds of South America, southern and western portions of Africa, and much of Antarctica. In all, the prospective viewing audience will be about a half billion people. [ Solar Eclipses: An Observer's Guide (Infographic) ]

NEXT: Planetary dazzle

Winter into Early Spring - ""The Venus Show"" This brilliant planet will dazzle evening skywatchers in January and February, setting nearly 4 hours after the sun. The planet will soar high into the western sky during that time, becoming so intensely brilliant that it will be able to cast shadows. It will drop back toward the sun during March, but will appear as a beautiful, slender crescent even in binoculars. The planet will transition to the morning sky in April, this time reappearing as a magnificent predawn object for early spring.

NEXT: A hiding star

March 4 - Occultation of Aldebaran The brightest star that can be hidden by the moon - called an occultation - will be occulted for Hawaii, the contiguous United States, Central America and the western Caribbean the evening of March 4.

NEXT: Lord of the Rings

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute

June through October - Saturn ""Opens Up"" The ""Lord of the Rings"" will be in excellent position for viewing during convenient evening hours this summer and fall. More importantly, its famous and beautiful ring system will be wide open, tilted about as far toward Earth as it can get and affording a spectacular sight for viewers even through small telescopes. The rings will be at their best since 2003 and will be displayed at their maximum inclination of 27 degrees on Oct. 17.

Jan. 3 - Quadrantid Meteor Shower This meteor display features a very sharp peak Jan. 3, and it is due to reach its maximum at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) this morning. That timing favors viewers on the West Coast of North America, where dawn will be breaking just as the ""Quads"" are reaching their peak. Anywhere from 60 to 120 meteors per hour might be seen by a single observer watching from a dark-sky site. Farther to the east, morning twilight and sunrise will interfere, but skywatchers might still spot a good number of these meteors. The moon will not pose any interference.

Aug. 12 - Perseid Meteor Shower This annual meteor display is perhaps the most popular, because it appears at a time of year when most people are out on vacation. Many discover it for themselves while camping or enjoying some R&R at a location far from city lights. The unusual abundance of these bright streaks of light calls attention to the night sky, and the meteors indeed usually come in good numbers, sometimes as many as 90 or more per hour. However, this year, the moon will create a major problem; a 75 percent illuminated waning gibbous will light up the after-midnight skies and obscure all but the brightest meteors.

Aug. 21 - Total Eclipse of the Sun Those living within a path roughly 70 miles (112 kilometers) wide and stretching from coast to coast across the United States will get an opportunity to observe nature's greatest show Aug. 21: a total eclipse of the sun.

This total solar eclipse will be the first in nearly four decades to be visible so close to home for Americans. It will mark the first time in this century, and the first time since 1979, that a total solar eclipse will cross the contiguous (48) United States. (Alaska had its turn in 1990, Hawaii in 1991.) The shadow's track - better known as the ""path of totality"" - will sweep over only the United States and no other country for the very first time in modern history, leading some to refer this upcoming event as ""The Great American Eclipse."" [ Total Solar Eclipse 2017: When, Where and How to See It (Safely) ]

Many Americans taking full advantage of this event's close proximity to their homes will have a golden opportunity to witness firsthand one of the most beautiful and exciting of nature's sky events. The total eclipse will be seen by an estimated 12 million people who fortuitously live within the totality path. However, the number of people who are within just one day's drive of the totality zone is probably around 225 million. This will likely be one of the big events of 2017, and Space.com will provide you with all the details as this ""day of darkness"" gets closer.

NEXT: Regulus covered

Oct. 15 - Occultation of Regulus The brightest star in Leo, the lion, will be covered by a slender crescent moon before sunrise Oct. 15 as seen from the United States and most of the Caribbean.

NEXT: A hiding star (again)

Nov. 5 - Occultation of Aldebaran For the second time this year, the moon crosses in front of orange Aldebaran Nov. 5. The moon is nearly full, a 95-percent waning gibbous, and this early evening event will be visible from North America, except the westernmost part.

Nov. 13 - Brilliant Double Planet Lies Low in the Dawn About 45 minutes before sunrise, low to the east-southeast horizon, the two brightest planets, Venus and Jupiter, rise side by side and are separated by only 0.3 degrees. It's truly a beautiful sight, if you don't have any obstructions like trees or buildings in that same direction.

Dec. 14 - Geminid Meteor Shower Many meteor observers consider the annual December Geminids to be the best shower of the year, surpassing even the famous Perseids of August. The Geminids are due to reach their 2016 peak early this morning, when up to 120 slow, graceful meteors per hour may be seen under ideal dark-sky conditions. The very best time to watch for them is around 2 a.m. local time, when Gemini stands almost directly overhead. The moon will be a narrow crescent and will be of little or no hindrance, and this could very well be one of the best meteor showers in many years.

2431676063,"#Tecnología 4 coches voladores que ya están en el horno

Los coches autónomos serán uno de los protagonistas de 2017, pero hay otro pilar de este sector que no podemos olvidar: los coches voladores. Aquí os dejamos algunos ejemplos de proyectos que están siendo desarrollados:

Lilium Aviación

Lilium, con sede en Munich, está construyendo un coche volador con 36 ventiladores eléctricos dirigibles, y aseguran que podrán llegar a los 300 km/h y 300 km de autonomía. Ya han recibido 10 millones de dólares de inversión y el apoyo de la Agencia Espacial Europea. 

Los intereses de Larry Page

Larry Page es un fan de los coches voladores, y ha estado invirtiendo en algunas empresas relacionadas con el mundo de los coches voladores.

Las empresas Zee.Aero y Kitty Hawk han creado diseños de coches voladores, con prototipos funcionales existentes. Zee.Aero, de hecho, contrató ingenieros especializados en el sector, tanto de la NASA como de Boeing y SpaceX, y ya tienen patentes como la mostrada en la imagen superior.

Ehang 184

Es una especie de dron gigante creado por la compañía china Ehang, capaz de llevar una personas de hasta 100 kilos y viajar unos 100km durante unos 20 minutos. Es totalmente eléctrico, tiene cuatro brazos, ocho hélices, ocho motores y dos conjuntos de sensores. Despega y aterriza verticalmente, y no necesita un curso de vuelo, aunque tardará en ser legal en la mayoría de los países.

Los taxis voladores de Airbus

Se trata del proyecto Vahana, de Airbus Group, y tienen pensado tenerlo listo a finales de 2017.

Es un dron gigante de un solo asiento que podrá usarse también para carga, y ya tiene algunos clientes interesados en el ministerio de Defensa.

Dentro de poco podremos ver los primeros vuelos de prueba, por lo que estaremos atentos a los avances.

A recently-surfaced dashcam video appears to show Tesla's autopilot mode predicting an accident moments before it actually happens. It currently takes hours to charge an electric car - but Elon Musk just hinted that Tesla's next-gen superchargers will be able to juice up an eve in mere seconds. Musk also confirmed plans for a new Tesla Roadster, which is expected to debut in 2019. Uber recently launched a fleet of self-driving cars in California, but the state promptly shut the experiment down. Uber won't have to look far for a new testing grounds, though - Nevada is welcoming the company's self-driving taxis. France just marked a clean energy milestone by opening the world's first solar road. It's paved with 2,880 ultra-durable photovoltaic panels, and it stretches for a full kilometer in Tourouvre-au-Perche. In other clean energy news, Panasonic announced plans to invest $256 million in Tesla's Buffalo solar panel plant. Researchers developed a revolutionary new battery that's made from a single sheet of paper and powered by bacteria. And the UK is building six massive factories that will produce 25,000 solar-powered prefab houses every year.

Agriculture is an ancient cornerstone of civilization - but several new projects are pushing the practice into the future. MIT is developing high-tech ""food computers"" that are able to quickly and efficiently grow crops anywhere, while Farm From a Box has launched a solar-powered shipping container packed with everything you need to grow enough food for 150 people (except the plot of land). In other design and technology news, Stanford has created a humanoid robotic diver to explore depths too dangerous for people, and China launched a major space initiative to send a probe to Mars and search for extraterrestrial life. Finally, as we count down the hours to 2017 we've rounded up the most viral, shocking and inspiring stories of the year in the fields of design and wearable technology.

2431676549,"It's a new year, and just in case you wanted more to read after all the great books that 2016 gave us, prepare yourself. 2017 is going to have a ton of new books to dive into.

I always like January for this reason: it's a good time to take a look at the rest of the year, to see just what's coming up that we should be getting excited for. We'll have a broad 2017 book forecast in a couple of days, but that doesn't mean that we can't start off the new year by taking a look at what's coming out this month. So clear out your bookshelves or your bedside table, because there's a lot to make room for.

2431678311,"Home Virtual Reality has seemingly been looming on the horizon for three decades, ever since VPL Research founder Jaron Lanier announced the EyePhone device which retailed for just short of $10,000. But motion sickness, and the astronomical price, pushed the technology into the wilderness.

The VPL EyePhone from 1989. Image: VPL Research https://vrwiki.wikispaces.com/

This year, home Virtual Reality re-entered mainstream consciousness with no less than five new devices under the Christmas tree, ranging from premium technology room-scale experiences like HTC Vive (think Star Trek's Holodeck) to more accessible smartphone-based products such as Google Daydream and Samsung Gear, and a price range from £12 (Google Cardboard) to £689 (HTC Vive). Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg calls it:

The next major computing platform that will come after mobile

The Oculus Rift headset with the Oculus Touch hand controllers. Image: Oculus VR https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/rift/

With these new devices, it will be interesting to observe which one finds most favour in 2017: Will Facebook-owned Oculus Rift make use of its technology and social media real-estate to market its pioneering product to the masses, or will Sony's Playstation VR deliver the fun games to make VR a genuine prospect for a world of console gamers? Will people prefer affordability and portability with Samsung's Gear over the need for a tricky room-based setup with the HTC Vive, arguably the most immersive and wow device of all?

At its core, Virtual Reality remains a gaming technology. However all of the various devices are equally adept at providing amazing storytelling experiences, 360° music videos, or plunging the user into historic galleries and exotic worlds. Entering a famous Vincent Van Gogh painting in Borrowed Light Studios' ""The Night Café"" is, in equal measures, beautiful and surreal.

Borrowed Light Studios' ""The Night Café is a unique experience allowing you to walk around a Café inspired by the famous painting from Van Gogh. Image: Borrowed Light Studios http://www.borrowedlightvr.com/the-night-cafe/

As the user base is small, the market for ""Triple A"" gaming titles lasting hundreds of hours is minimal. The fortunate side-effect is a booming market for short experiences and quirkier games such as ""Accounting"" from the Crows Crows Crows Studio which are both enjoyable and affordable. But there is still the odd zombie shooter, and zombies jumping up on you in virtual reality is very, very frightening. Beyond slaughtering undead hordes, are there more constructive applications of virtual reality technology? Yes, and the possibilities are endless....

Education and Training

Virtual Reality has always been a prospect for training in professions where peoples' lives and health are at stake. Simulators are already used to train pilots dealing with unexpected events, but the opportunity for more convenient home practice can only be a positive development.

Medical professionals can learn interventions for the operating room, emergency department or clinic, both challenging and more routine. The Miami Children's Hospital, for example, is developing medical instructional software for basic procedures such as nasogastric tube insertion and starting an IV drip, with the aim of educating doctors as well as patients. Medical and nursing students can also learn their subject with more context than a book, for example by interacting with a ""live"" anatomical dissection table.

Organon VR Anatomy on the Oculus Rift makes learning anatomical structures more vivid and helps the understanding of spatial relationship between them. Image: Author's Own http://www.3dorganon.com/site/

Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the use of simulation medicine, particularly in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and life support where it provides a much more realistic way of portraying a scenario than a mannequin and actors, and where it provides more for assessment: Gestures, eye movements, metrics and real-time feedback are more useful assessors of these skills than a written examination.

For surgical training, VR is increasingly being proposed for the learning of minimally-invasive surgical procedures. It allows a realistic operating room environment, including interaction with colleagues, but in a safer environment where mistakes are not going to cause any harm. Bimanual tool handles and force feedback can mimic surgical tools - although it will take a while for this to be accurate enough to use at home, to the level of devices such as the NeuroTouch - a commercially available brain surgery simulator. New developments in tracking technologies such as Microsoft's Handpose (which records complex hand movements) may add more intricacy to VR surgery training.

Virtual Reality is not limited to learning practical skills. Even attributes like empathy can be augmented through the headsets. Embodied Labs has designed a VR program called ""We Are Alfred"" which gives medical students, many of whom are in their twenties, an insight into experiencing the life of a 74 year-old man with audiological and visual problems. Providing the experience and learning the patient's perspective can be invaluable in how the students develop as medical professionals.

Embodied Labs' ""We Are Alfred"" allows students to experience the life of a 74 year-old with visual and audiological problems. Image: Embodied Labs http://www.embodiedlabs.com/

The complete audiovisual immersion provided by Virtual Reality can conjure or awaken emotions which users may not have been aware of. This has been used to good effect in journalism, such as The Guardian's award-winning 6x9 experience of solitary confinement and film-maker Nonny de la Pena's Project Syria which inserts the viewer into the plight of Syrian child refugees.

The founder of Oculus VR Palmer Luckey, affirms that this immersive power of Virtual Reality can be a medium for social change, through its ability to put you in places ""in a much more real way"" . Virtual reality campaigns following the 2015 Nepal Earthquake and The Dolphin Project (Both Huffington Post's RYOT) have had a palpable impact on awareness. A recent AT&T campaign in the United States sees the user driving a car through residential neighbourhoods and ending up causing a tragedy whilst texting. The feedback following this emotive exercise showed that people who had the VR experience consciously removed their phones before driving.

New ways of working

Meetings and conferences are set to transform from the often vaguely distant videoconference to VR meetings. The social games and experiences on this years' devices have highlighted how much more connected people feel when they are in a shared VR space than a 2-dimensional screen. Be it event/product marketing, site inspections, interviews or negotiations, the presence and interactivity afforded by Virtual Reality will see it slowly replace Skype as ""the next best thing"" to physical contact.

In the field of surgery, earlier this year, Dr Shafi Ahmed performed bowel surgery which was live-streamed for anyone to ""jump into the operating theatre"". With improvements in haptic devices, performing remote surgery may become a reality sooner than we would have expected.

Tests and Therapies

Diagnosis of illness lends itself to Virtual Reality, particular for conditions in which visual assessment is important such as Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. A test developed by Tomsk Polytechnic and Siberian State Universities in Russia uses cheap headsets and Microsoft Kinect sensors to monitor people's movements in virtual environments. Neurologists are then able to make earlier diagnoses and start rehabilitation. Indeed, the ability to see a doctor face-to-face from distance was one of the motivations for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg when he purchased the Oculus VR company.

Virtual Reality being used to diagnose Parkinson's Disease. Image: Tomsk Polytechnic University http://tpu.ru/en/news-events/914/

Oculus founder Palmar Luckey first identified the potential of VR in rehabilitation whilst working with a team of therapists at the University of Southern California, helping military veterans who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder by providing exposure therapy. This involved recreating battlefield episodes but allowing the guidance and support of a trained therapist to help identify and address the psychological trigger for illness. He said that this was when he first identified that virtual reality can be an important new therapy method:

It can make a significant difference in people's lives

Virtual reality has been shown to be beneficial in rehabilitation after strokes, particularly in improving upper limb strength and in re-learning activities of daily living. There have also been potential benefits observed in helping motor learning in children with cerebral palsy. It can become a key weapon in the rehabilitation arsenal for physiotherapists and occupational therapists over the next decade, changing the face of rehabilitation for all kinds of diseases.

Virtual Reality is no longer in its infancy. It has hit the mainstream and is here to stay. Let's use it to improve our world.

2431678382,"It could be a huge year at the box office for comic book movies, as studios look to serve up a number of sequels to some of their most popular franchises, while introducing a host of new properties.

The year has a number of milestones in store. The latest iteration of Sony's Spider-Man franchise merges with Walt Disney and Marvel Studio's cinematic universe. Warrner Bros. and DC Comics launch their answer to Marvel's Avengers with ""."" Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman portrays Wolverine one last time, after eight separate appearances in the role since 2000-a few of those in his own solo films.

For Marvel Comics and DC fans alike, 2017 is shaping up to be ""comic book nirvana,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore. The coming year ""is going to be a killer. I think it's going to be the biggest year ever,"" he told CNBC. ""The superhero side of things I think is going to be kind of off the chart.""

Here's why the box office could bulge on the strength of this year's superhero slate. , Feb. 10 The year of superhero ""nirvana"" kicks off on a silly note, but ticket sales for """" may be nothing to laugh at.

The animated action-comedy spins out of the 2014 Warner Bros. feature ""The Lego Movie,"" which drummed up $469 million worldwide and earned a spot among the top 20 highest-grossing computer animated films of all time. The sequel marks the return of comedic actor Will Arnett's caped crusader, who played a supporting role in ""The Lego Movie."" Logan, March 3 | The last solo outing for the X-Men's marquee mutant was a moderate hit, though its $415 million worldwide gross is more impressive in light of the relatively low budget for ""The Wolverine."" That film, like the upcoming ""Logan,"" took a grounded, gritty approach.

The first trailer for ""Logan"" - featuring an older, more world-weary Wolverine navigating a dystopian future - generated about 77,500 tweets in the week of its release, the highest for any upcoming movie, according to Boxoffice.com.

Following the success of Fox's R-rated ""Deadpool"" this year, released an international trailer for ""Logan"" with a scene of graphic violence. With an ""R"" rating of its own, ""Logan"" has stoked fan expectations for the rough-edged hero.

Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2, May 5 | Two years ago, analysts were sounding warning bells as Marvel prepared to release ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" it's biggest gamble at the time. But the light-hearted space opera cemented Marvel's reputation as a hit-maker, eventually earning $773 million at the box office.

That take beat the haul for movies starring better-known characters like Superman, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Fans have been eagerly awaiting the return of Marvel's band of intergalactic misfits since 2014, since which the star of leading man Chris Pratt has risen appreciably.

""Now 'Guardians of the Galaxy' suddenly becomes a premier title that gets to be in that No. 1 slot for Marvel, which is that opening weekend of the summer season,"" Dergarabedian said.

Wonder Woman, June

Studios have long struggled to bring DC's star-spangled heroine to life, but Warner Bros. hit the mark last year. Gail Gadot's Wonder Woman was lauded as one of the strongest - if not the strongest - part of Warner Bros. ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.""

Despite negative reviews, ""Batman v Superman"" took in $873 million worldwide, enough to crack into the top 10 highest grossing superhero movies. The Amazonian princess takes center stage in a World War I period film this summer.

Had ""Batman v Superman"" been more loved, it could have been a billion-dollar movie, Dergarabedian said. With ""Wonder Woman,"" Warner gets another chance to breach that mark, a feat it has failed to achieve since 2012, when Christopher Nolan's final Batman film earned nearly $1.1 billion.

Spider-Man: Homecoming, July 7 Sony's last attempt to reboot the legendary wall-crawler fell flat; both films in its ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" series failed to surpass the worldwide gross for any of the movies in the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy that concluded in 2007.

Now, Sony has a not-so-secret weapon: A creative partnership that brings Spider-Man into ' multi-billion dollar shared cinematic universe.

A teenage Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland, made his high-profile debut in ""Captain America: Civil War"" - the fourth highest grossing superhero movie of all time. He will also get an assist from Robert Downey Jr.'s massively popular Iron Man in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

Marvel's The Inhumans, September | Marvel announced last month it would launch ""Marvel's The Inhumans"" on ABC, marking a change in its plans to bring the royal family of super-powered individuals to life in a 2019 film. But the Inhumans will still grace the big screen, thanks to a deal with IMAX to co-finance the pilot, and screen it in theaters for two weeks in September.

It's hard to tell how much the limited engagement will make, but the theatrical release gives Marvel the opportunity to make some hard cash on the series premiere. Inhumans are not an unknown property; the race of superhumans has featured prominently in ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."", now in its fourth season on ABC.

Thor: Ragnarok, Nov. 3 Thor returns for his third solo outing, but Marvel's 'God of Thunder' is bringing backup. Fellow Avenger the Hulk joins Thor for the Nordic end of days, in what co-star Mark Ruffalo has called ""an intergalactic buddy road movie.""

That suggests Marvel will rely on two strategies it has recently used to great success: pairing up characters it has introduced on the silver screen over nearly a decade, and merging superhero blockbusters with other film genres.

Fans get the chills seeing comic book characters pop up in one another's movies, said Dergarabedian. ""That's the key to success for most of these films going forward."" , Nov. 17 Warner Bros. will take a major step on that front with ""."" The film unites DC's holy trinity - Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman - on the big screen for the first time, with support from the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.

Warner Bros. has walked a rockier road than Marvel in building an interconnected web of movies. Its comparatively grimmer films have been poorly reviewed, and often underperform Marvel's more light-hearted flicks at the box office.

But the studio gained traction this year with ""Batman v Superman"" and its villain team-up ""Suicide Squad,"" both of which rose above negative reviews and succeeded financially. If any DC film has a chance of breaking a billion, it's ""."" ""They're still trying to find that voice, that rhythm, and I think 2017 may be the year that delivers what people are rooting for, which is, in a given year, a couple of phenomenal DC movies,"" Dergarabedian said.

"
2431680496,"It's a ""Sunday Morning"" tradition. Come the end of the year, Jane Pauley takes time to remember some of the many people who left us in the year gone by. After having , we now say HAIL AND FAREWELL to many others whose lives touched our own:

""You know, these are like my children,"" he said. ""They are will be all that will be left upon my departing of this experience.""

If you don't like the world you're living in

Take a look around you

At least you got friends ...

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down

Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy

Let's get nuts ...

We're all excited

But we don't know why

Maybe it's 'cause

We're all gonna die

And when we do, what's it all for

You better live now

Before the Grim Reaper come knocking on your door.

In his life, he maintained an aura of mystery. And at 57, he left us this past year ... he left us wanting more.

Author Pat Conroy left us in 2016. Among his novels: ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""The Great Santini,"" both about families: ""It always seemed literature is much better when there's a love-hate relationship.""

He told CBS News, ""I always felt if I told the story of the South I'll tell the history of the whole world."" (""Sunday Morning"")Passage: Three outsized talents (""Sunday Morning"")

As an overly-involved parent on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" everybody loved Emmy-winning mom Doris Roberts.

Raymond: ""But other parents aren't lying, Ma. They believe in their children.""

Marie: ""No, they don't.""""Mama tried, Mama tried.

Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.

That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.""

Merle Haggard sang about his mother. But he was no mama's little angel. ""The more I went to jail,"" he said, ""the more I learned about being an outlaw.""

Convicted for burglary as a young man, Haggard spent time in San Quentin, then mined his life story for his songs -- and became a legend. (""CBS Evening News"")Some other music giants left us during the year, including Joey Feek, who sang:

""You wonder why the Earth still moves.

You wonder how you'll carry on.

But you'll be okay on that first day when I'm gone.""

Also, singer Bobby Vee; musician Leon Russell; Paul Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane; Fred Hellerman of The Weavers; music producer Sir George Martin; bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley; Malik ""Phife Dawg"" Taylor, of A Tribe Called Quest; and Keith Emerson and Greg Lake, both of Emerson, Lake & Palmer. ""I'd like to teach the world to sing,

in perfect harmony.

I'd like to buy a Coke,

and keep it company,

because that's the real thing.""

Adman Bill Backer was the real thing. He wrote jingles for Coca-Cola, tag-lines for Campbell's Soup (""Soup is good food""), and remember this one? ""If you've got the time, we've got the beer!""

Jim Delligatti didn't write the jingle for the Big Mac, but he cooked up the recipe (Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun). Billions have been served since.

Raymond Tomlinson: You might say he knew where it's at: he put the @ sign in our addresses. In countless photographs, Bill Cunningham turned the people of New York into trendsetting models. ""The best fashion show is definitely on the street -- always has been, and always will be,"" he said.

But it was on catwalks where designer James Galanos showed his style. As he put it, ""Times change, people change, looks change. But good taste is the most important thing."" And it may be that no one wore Galanos better than first lady Nancy Reagan, who also left us this past year. She was known for being President Ronald Reagan's closest advisor.

""I think there's always a certain jealousy, if that's the word you want to use, of the one who's closest to the president,"" she said, ""and obviously the one closest is his wife ... or should be, I hope!""

After the president's diagnosis with Alzheimer's, Mrs. Reagan became an important supporter of stem cell research (""I just don't see how we can turn our backs on this""), a stance at odds with some of her fellow Republicans. (""CBS This Morning"")

""I think the pro-lifers are the vitality, the enthusiasm and the heart and soul of the Republican Party,"" said Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative who battled fiercely for her causes.

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia: He, too, was a vibrant conservative voice (""I attack ideas, I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day job"").

He was a fighter who could also be engagingly warm as a colleague and friend. ""I can be charming and combative at the same time,"" he said. ""What's contradictory between the two? I love to argue. It may well be that I'm something of a shin kicker.""Gallery: Antonin Scalia 1936-2016

Activist Tom Hayden fought for the other side; he was a leader of the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s. ""Those who tried to put us in jail have gone to prison themselves,"" he once said. ""Well, we are still here!""

Fidel Castro was a leader of the Cuban resistance in the 1950s, who became a dictator in the Sixties, and who would live to haunt 11 U.S. presidents. Some admired him; others feared and even fled him. (""Sunday Morning"")Castro: The good and the bad (""Sunday Morning"") (""Sunday Morning"")Gallery: Fidel Castro 1926-2016

It was then-Attorney General Janet Reno who made the controversial decision to send one young refugee, Elián González, back to Cuba. ""It is time for this little boy, who has been through so much, to be with his father,"" she said.

Reno was our first woman attorney general, and she served while grappling with Parkinson's. Through it all, she never compromised her ideals.

... Nor did Muhammad Ali. (""I'm the king of the world! I am pretty!"") He was a three-time world heavyweight boxing champion. Born Cassius Clay, Ali changed his name when he converted to Islam.

""It's Muhammad Ali. Muhammad means 'worthy of all praises,' and Ali means 'most kind.'""

He became a polarizing figure for his religious beliefs and his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War. ""Whatever suffering or punishment I may have to take, it'll all be because of my religion,"" he said.

But he would later be admired as much for fighting for his convictions as for fighting in the ring. He, too, was afflicted with Parkinson's, but put up the good fight to the end.

""And I'm still the king, and the greatest of all time!""The life of ""The Greatest"" (""Sunday Morning"") Arnold Palmer was the first superstar of golf. He popularized not only the game, but the iced tea-and-lemonade drink that bears his name. We raise a glass to him!

""And even though it all went wrong,

I'll stand right here before the lord of song

with nothing, nothing on my tongue but

Hallelujah.""

Leonard Cohen left us last year at age 82. Cohen was already a poet and novelist when he released his first record. We'll remember his deep voice and powerful songs. Bill Flanagan on Leonard Cohen (""Sunday Morning"")Gallery: Remembering singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, 1934-2016

And Zsa Zsa! We'll remember Zsa Zsa Gabor for her glamorous lifestyle -- and many, many marriages. Patty Duke became a star on stage and screen as a child when she played Helen Keller. But she may be best remembered for those identical cousins on ""The Patty Duke Show.""

I couldn't see Jerry Silverman in 'Hamlet,' in 'Macbeth.' The ring, it doesn't sound right.""

""I have no regrets. I've had a wonderful life, a charmed life, a great career"" he said.

""Just think. Yesterday, I was a meaningless little accountant, and today I'm the producer of a Broadway flop!"" (""Sunday Morning"")Gallery: Gene Wilder 1933-2016

Not so, Edward Albee. He won three Pulitzer Prizes for his plays. His ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff"" is a classic.

""No two people see the same play,"" Albee said. ""The experience they bring, the enthusiasms they bring, what they wish to think about, what they don't want to think about.

And we will never forget our service men and women who died protecting our rights and freedoms during the year gone by. We thank them.

And we'll remember David Bowie. His songs spoke to millions.

How can we forget his many stage personas and wild wardrobe? (""A lot of it just makes me laugh,"" he said. ""I mean, have you seen those boots?"")

His performances were quite simply out of this world:

""There's a starman waiting in the sky

He'd like to come and meet us

But he thinks he'd blow our minds

There's a starman waiting in the sky

He's told us not to blow it

2431683016,"""That's our trouble,"" said my friend Roger, ""everything used to be something else."" I had just told him about meeting my brothers and their families for the third Chanukah candle, 13 relatives in all, at a glatt kosher restaurant called Taam Tov in the Diamond District, on the very site of the legendary Gotham Book Mart. On November 17, 1986, my book, Kerouac's Spontaneous Poetics, one of the first full-scale studies on the iconic beat poet and novelist, was celebrated here. A sign, ""Wise Men Fish Here,"" marked the spot, a literary emporium on a bejeweled street. The James Joyce Society met here. Among many other book parties, a reissue of Junkie was feted here too, in 1977. Carl Solomon and Patti Smith attended, honoring William S. Burroughs' work. Poet Allen Ginsberg, who had clerked here back in the day, snapped my picture.

The parties raged one flight up. Book covers in frames lined your ascent. These literary events were officiated by book dealer Andreas Brown, who acquired the place from Frances Steloff, who resided in the apartment above. Miss Steloff insisted on serving a dip concocted from Lipton's onion soup and sour cream, scooped up on Frito's corn chips. This was her favorite treat with the free flowing wine. She died in 1989, at age 101, but her salon tradition continued until 2003, when Brown was forced to move.

The sign is now gone; the door, a cheap glass job that blends in with the commerce of the street, leads to a humble dining space adorned with Middle East tableaux. My family sat at a table overlooking 47th street. Many cars were parked illegally, but the police were not ticketing. Mountains of food: falafel and pilaf and kasha and stuffed cabbage, chicken, lamb, beef kebabs, arrived on generous platters, a delicious heimish feast. Max (almost 2) sat on a table making finger puppets with his aunt Jane. Jonathan announced he was applying to medical school. Paulina made Dean's List. And newly weds Lindsay and Noah showed off iphone shots of their new arrival, a fleecy white puppy. We paid homage to our parents, Holocaust survivors, who would be proud to see their offspring proliferating and prospering. I engaged the children with stories of the Gotham's starry past, a literary history fast faded, and hard to imagine in our world today.

I actually prepared for a singing audition. Beyonce released a transcendant album. Peak TV kept happening and happening and happening."
2431684524,"BESTOFF VĚDÁTOR 2016 (takže not really breaking news teď): BREAKING FUCKING NEWS via Kosmonautix​! Status budu postupně updatovat, doufajíc, že Elon Musk to jenom přehnal s protřepáváním ranního šampaňského... :-/ 

Aktualizace, cywe: 
První informace mluví o nehodě během pokusného zážehu rakety Falcon 9 (EN bit.ly/2bEDtZn). Nosič měl být natlakován a naplněn palivem. Situaci sleduje zevrubně Kosmonautix zde bit.ly/2c7o4NX.

Na místě prý nejsou zranění, prozatím to však nebylo oficiálně potvrzeno. Zcela nový nosič a rampa byly kompletně zničeny - nešlo o test recyklovaného stupně, jež má letět na podzim.

Fachmani z Kosmonautix spekulují, že mohlo jednat o závadu na raketě - pak se můžeme těšit na zastavení letů a dlouhé vyšetřování - anebo ""v lepším případě"" závadu související s rampou.

Aktualizováno 16:23, OMG: Z videa je nát, že požár už jen doutná. V diskuzi SpaceX CZ/SK​ bylo zmíněno, že na explozi došlo 3 minuty před plánovaným zážehem - což naznačuje, že chyba nemusela být na straně rakety samotné.

Aktualizováno 16.33, LOL: V rámci situace došlo asi i na explozi toxického hydrazinu, používaného pro manévrovací trysky ve vesmíru - z čehož se spekuluje, že na palubě nosiče byl i užitný náklad, IZRAELSKÝ satelit Amos-6. #anewconpiracyinmaking

Twitter SpaceX​ stále mlčí, stejně jako ten Elona Muska - teď už ale jenom DVA DNY STARÉ vyjádření děkující za důvěru vloženou ve společnost díky schválení startu již jednou letícího nosiče Falcon 9 nepůsobí tak fajnově, jako ještě před hodinou a šesti minutami...

Aktualizováno 16.49, SRY: SpaceX v tiskovce (bit.ly/2ctszpC) POTVRDILO ztrátu jak rakety, tak satelitu Amos 6 v hodnotě 200 milionů dolarů. Dneska bude někdo bez večeře. :-(

Nehoda se skutečně obešla bez zranění, podle SpaceX je na vině ""anomálie na startovací rampě"", zatím bez upřesnění. Na to si asi ještě počkáme dlouho. Floridský 45th Space Wing amerického letectva potvrdil (bit.ly/2bXV2AO), že na výbuch došlo v 9.07 EDT (15.07 našeho času).

Prozatím je jisté toliko, že na plánovaný start 3. září jistojistě nedojde. -_-

A group of 1,100 people from Sub-Saharan Africa trying to reach Europe stormed the border fence just after 4 am (0300 GMT) on New Year's Day in an ""extremely violent and organised"" way, said the central government's representative office in Ceuta.

None however managed to get through bar two who were badly injured and taken to hospital in Ceuta, the office said in a statement. A similar assault on December 9 saw more than 400 migrants enter the tiny enclave.

They tried ""to force open some of the doors in the external fence, using iron bars, wire cutters and large stones with which they assaulted Moroccan forces and (Spanish) Guardia Civil (police) agents,"" it added.

Five Spanish policemen and 50 members of the Moroccan forces were injured, including one who lost an eye, it said.

Ceuta along with Melilla, another Spanish territory in North Africa, have the European Union's only land borders with Africa.

They are one of the entry points for African migrants seeking a better life in Europe, who get there by either climbing over the border fence or by swimming along the coast.

According to local authorities, of the 1,100 migrants who stormed the border, just over 100 managed to climb up the external fence and stayed on top for hours.

Footage shot by the local Faro TV shows one man perched at the top of the six-metre (20-foot) high fence, sitting uncomfortably near rolls of barbed wire, his head hanging down onto his chest.

Eventually as darkness turns to light, he slowly climbs down to a space between both fences and lies down as a Spanish policeman fetches him a bottle of water before taking him to an entry back into Morocco.

Separately, coastguards said they had rescued 52 people who were packed onto a small boat at sea south of Malaga on Spain's southern coast.

2431699505,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - The South Carolina 2018 governor's race was supposed to be wide open, with the departure of popular Republican Nikki Haley, term-limited from seeking a third run. Now, with Haley's potential early departure pending her confirmation as U.N. ambassador, a space has been created for current Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster - who will step in if Haley's confirmed - to run as an incumbent next year.

The Democratic side remains clear, with a few names tossed around but no candidate commitments. But with the state's politics trending more and more conservative over the past decade or more, attention is focused on the potential pool of candidates who will vie for the Republican nomination. McMaster is getting a lot of attention, but will he get some GOP company on primary ballots?

___

THE INCUMBENT

McMaster, 69, is a veteran of politics, both as a candidate but also a party leader helping shape the process. Serving as U.S. Attorney under President Ronald Reagan, McMaster also led South Carolina's GOP and was the state's attorney general for eight years.

He sought the state's office in 2010, when he finished third in a four-way Republican primary ultimately won by Haley. He backed Haley and led her transition efforts, as well as an ethics committee she created to make reform recommendations.

Haley was re-elected in 2014, and McMaster was elected separately as lieutenant governor. Starting in 2018, governor and lieutenant governor will be elected on the same ticket, so McMaster could have the opportunity to pick his No. 2.

A member of South Carolina's GOP establishment, McMaster went outside those boundaries early last year when he became the nation's first statewide officeholder to back Donald Trump for president. The move stunned political observers, but McMaster's support never wavered, despite Democrats' calls to withdraw it.

The move has now seemingly paid off, with Trump's nomination of Haley clearing McMaster's pathway to the governor's office, a post he's always wanted.

He's said little so far about what he'll do as governor, but McMaster has told The Associated Press in several interviews since Trump's election he'll do whatever he can to support the new president on the state's behalf.

___

THE OUTSIDER

Although she's never sought elected office, Catherine Templeton is no stranger to politics. The labor lawyer and union-fighting specialist was mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. labor secretary after she was summoned to Trump Tower for a meeting with the president-elect.

Templeton has earned a reputation in South Carolina for having a no-nonsense approach to getting things done. She ran the state's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation early in Haley's first term, cutting out redundancies and streamlining the agency. Haley played up Templeton's union-fighting background and ability to keep unions out of the new Boeing Inc. assembly plant in North Charleston. After a lawsuit over comments Haley made about the duo's ability to ""fight the unions"" at Boeing, the International Association of Machinists ultimately canceled a vote to certify the union.

Templeton served Haley a second time, directing South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, the state's largest agency. As Ebola concerns swirled in late 2014, Templeton said her agency needed the ability to send simultaneous health alerts to hospitals on the front lines of identifying a potential outbreak. The director herself even tested the state's abilities, showing up at two Charleston hospitals and said she was suffering from the flu, in an attempt to see if hospitals were really ready to tackle identifying an unknown outbreak.

Templeton has said she's exploring a gubernatorial bid but has made no official announcement.

___

THE PROSECUTOR

As a solicitor in the 1990s, Tommy Pope launched to nationwide fame for his case against Susan Smith, the Union County mother who killed her two sons by rolling her car into a lake. Pope pursued the death penalty against Smith, who was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.

Voters picked Pope to represent Rock Hill in the state House in 2010 and now, recently re-elected for a fourth term, he serves as House speaker pro tem. During last year's legislative session, Pope was chief sponsor of an ultimately successful ethics bill pushed by Haley.

Pope was the first Republican to officially say he'd run for governor after Haley's time was up, announcing in 2014 he'd make a run for the state's top slot. Pope's biggest challenge, if he sticks with the bid, will be to boost his name recognition across the state.

___

THE OTHERS

Many other Republicans have already been mentioned as potential 2018 gubernatorial hopefuls, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and state Sen. Tom Davis, a libertarian-leaning state senator recently elected to a fifth term representing some of South Carolina's coastal areas.

Yancey McGill, who briefly served as lieutenant governor, has previously said he'll run next year. Tim Scott, a widely popular black Republican who just won his first full term in the U.S. Senate, recently said he hasn't ruled out a bid. U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney had been considered a potential candidate until his recent nomination to serve as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget.

As for the Democrats, the only apparent certainty is that two-time nominee Vincent Sheheen won't be making a third gubernatorial bid. State lawmakers Brad Hutto and James Smith are often mentioned as potential candidates, although neither has committed to running.

2431699942,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" and ""Sing"" loomed large at the multiplexes over the New Year's holiday, racking up the biggest grosses and ringing out 2016 on a high note.

The Star Wars spinoff topped the box office for the third consecutive weekend, earning just under $50 million for the three-day period and a projected $64 million for the four-day holiday. The movie business is tacking Monday on to New Year's weekend, because many companies and schools are observing it as a national holiday. The weekend gross pushes the space opera over the $400 million mark domestically. It currently ranks as the year's second highest-grossing domestic release, with $425 million, behind only ""Finding Dory."" ""Rogue One"" concludes a record-annihilating year for Disney. The studio became the first to top $7 billion in a single year, has fielded four of the five top grossing domestic releases, and should see four of its movies top $1 billion at the global box office.

""Sing,"" the latest collaboration between Illumination and Universal, racked up $41.4 million during its second weekend in theaters. It is projected to earn $53.7 million for the four-day holiday weekend and has made $177.3 million stateside. It's the second smash of 2016 for Illumination, the maker of ""Despicable Me."" The company also scored with last summer's ""The Secret Life of Pets.""

In third place ""Passengers,"" a critically derided science fiction romance with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, earned $16.1 million over the three-day weekend and $20.7 million over the four day. As of Sunday, its domestic haul stands at $61.4 million. With a $110 million budget and millions more spent in promotion, ""Passengers"" will need a lift from foreign audiences if it hopes to make money.

The same is true for Fox's ""Assassin's Creed,"" which took in $8 million for the weekend and a projected $10 million for the holiday. The video game adaptation has earned $41 million since opening over Christmas - a dispiriting result given its hefty $125 million budget. Movies made from games are a mixed bag. For every hit like ""Mortal Combat"" or ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" there are a slew of duds such as ""Warcraft"" and ""Prince of Persia.""

Fox is having more luck with ""Why Him?"" The R-rated comedy earned $10 million over the three day period and an estimated $13 million for the four day holiday. The film about the rivalry between a father (Bryan Cranston) and his daughter's fiancee (James Franco) has earned $37.6 million and cost an economical $38 million to produce.

Paramount's ""Fences,"" expanded nicely. Denzel Washington directs and stars in the August Wilson adaptation, with Viola Davis playing a key supporting role. The drama earned $10.2 million over the three-day weekend and an estimated $13 million for the holiday. It has made $32.7 million since debuting three weeks ago in limited release.

Lionsgate's ""La La Land,"" continued to capitalize on awards buzz. The musical earned $9.5 million over the weekend and is projected to make $12.3 million over the four-day holiday, which would bring its gross to an estimated $37 million. On Friday, ""La La Land"" passed ""Hell or High Water"" to become the highest-grossing movie in limited release for the year.

Fox's ""Hidden Figures"" looks strong. The drama about the African-American scientists and mathematicians who played a pivotal role in the early days of America's space program, earned $815,000 for the three days and $1.1 million for the four days from just 25 theaters. It goes into wide release next weekend.

""20th Century Women"" and ""Paterson"" were released just under the wire in order to qualify for Oscars. ""20th Century Women,"" a comedy-drama that's earned some of the best reviews of Annette Bening's career, earned $112,705 for the weekend. A24 is handling the rollout. ""Patterson,"" a drama about a poetic bus driver, made $70,760. It is being released by Amazon Studios and Bleecker Street.

2431707206,"Crunch Network No cobalt, no Tesla? Posted 2 seconds ago by Sebastien Gandon (@SebZabojad) 0

SHARES Sebastien Gandon Crunch Network Contributor Sebastien Gandon is a senior VP at East Capital Asia Ltd. He has close to 15 years experience in the asset management industry and as an investor in energy storage, batteries, biotech/e-health and AI. How to join the network The battery industry currently uses 42 percent of global cobalt production, a critical metal for Lithium-ion cells. The remaining 58 percent is used in diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments...) that rely exclusively on the material. Approximately 97 percent of the world's supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper (mostly out of Africa). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Lundin agreed to sell to Chinese players their respective stakes in the Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the largest known cobalt sources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tesla has stated that the cobalt it needs will be sourced exclusively in North America, but the math doesn't seem to add up. Is Tesla doomed? Not necessarily... The Tenke Fungurume mine is one of the world's largest known cobalt resources. The concessions are located in the Katanga province in the southeast region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) holds a 56 percent interest, Lundin Mining (OTCPK:LUNMF) holds an indirect 24 percent equity interest and Gécamines, the Congolese state mining company, holds a 20 percent carried interest. In May, 2016, China Molybdenum acquired Freeport's 56 percent controlling interest in the mine for US$2.65 billion, the largest investment ever in the country. Lundin Mining was left with three options: allow the China Moly deal to proceed, supplant the offer by exercising a right to first offer or sell its own stake to China Moly (or a third party, for that matter). In November, and after several extensions, Lundin Mining finally announced it was selling its 24 percent stake to an affiliate of Chinese private-equity firm BHR Partners for US$1.14 billion. Freeport's sale to China Moly was expected to be completed before year's end, whilst Lundin plans to close its sale in early 2017. China Moly also acquired this year from Freeport a 100 percent interest in the Kisanfu exploration project located in the DRC and a 56 percent controlling interest in the Kokkola refinery in Finland (about 10 percent of the world's refined cobalt last year). Needless to say that all that cobalt from the refinery is expected to be shipped to China, South Korea and Japan from now on. The implications are clear. China is now leveling its game in upstream cobalt and is already a major owner of downstream assets in the DRC, embodied by Huayou Cobalt (CH:603799) and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt (CH:603799). It will keep on securing cobalt mines and downstream assets for its own needs. In November, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, head of the state-controlled Gécamines, passed on to the Financial Times his discontent of partnerships with western companies and, in particular, on the Freeport-McMoRan deal. Left with minority investments in most joint ventures (JV), Mr. Yuma believes that existing deals failed to deliver on dividends. The partnership with China Nonferrous Metal Mining. where Gécamines has a 49 percent stake, is the model he wants to generalize. One more headache for western operators. Supply and demand for cobalt As I stated in a previous article, we are already witnessing an increased scarcity of cobalt supply. Approximately 97 percent of the world's supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. But the price of the two other base metals have been plunging, to say the least, and this year reached six-year lows, making many deposits uneconomic. New primary cobalt mines may come online should cobalt prices soar; however, exploration, licensing and development take time and require billions of dollars of investments. In addition, 60 percent of the world's cobalt reserves and resources originate in the DRC, which is riddled with child labor and exploitation. On the demand front, and according to the Cobalt Development Institute (CDI), 58 percent of global cobalt production is already used in many diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments...) that rely exclusively on the material. Cobalt represents a negligible part of the costs for these companies and thus they can afford to pay regardless of the price. But that is a dangerous game for battery makers. Material costs account for about 60 percent of LIB total cost and battery makers cannot take away cobalt from companies for whom the metal is an absolute requirement. Think GE and its jet engines. The Tesla conundrum So where does that leave us with Tesla? Elon Musk ambitiously aims at producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year by 2018, and Tesla has repeatedly stated that the cobalt will be sourced exclusively in North America. Whether this is a realistic assumption is a different story. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) states that cobalt production in 2015 was 124,000 metric tons. Canada and the U.S. together produce roughly 4 percent of the world's supply, nowhere near Tesla's needs for just one of its models. Indeed, estimations from InvestorIntel show that half a million units of Tesla's Model 3 would be equivalent to 7,800 tons of new cobalt demand, or roughly 6 percent of the annual cobalt production worldwide. The math does not seem to add up. Tesla reportedly has difficulties securing off-take agreements from traditional cathode material suppliers and is reaching down to junior miners.

Precisely regarding the juniors' landscape, eCobalt Solutions Inc. (formerly Formation Metals) (TSX:ECS) is a Canadian mineral exploration and mine development company primarily owning the Idaho cobalt project, a high-grade and primary cobalt deposit in the U.S.. The highly anticipated project is by far the most advanced one in the region and should go online in a year's time. Two more years will be needed to run at full capacity. Production is estimated to reach roughly 1,500 tons annually over the course of a 12.5-year lifetime, i.e. about 1 percent of the global market. Compare this to Tesla's needs for the Model 3 and the new supply of cobalt in North America looks muted at best. Basic economics would tell us that whenever there is a soaring demand and a market supply moving into deficit, shortages and consequently an impact on prices are inevitable. Tesla looks doomed... ceteris paribus. So, is it really? Good news for Tesla bulls: There are several reasons why this may not be the case. Battery mix. For the Model S, Tesla has been using high energy density nickel-cobalt-aluminium-based (NCA) battery cells sourced from Panasonic. Again, we don't know the exact composition of the Panasonic/Tesla batteries, but typically cobalt represents about 0.22 kg/kWh in NCA batteries believes John Petersen from InvestorIntel. This compares to 0.36 kg/kWh for nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, which are adopted by most peers (and in which the three components are usually evenly split). Tesla would withstand more pressure versus its peers in the event of soaring prices. The Chinese BYD, a major player in the EV space, has adopted lower energy density Lithium-Iron-Phosphate LFP chemistry. Reconfiguring manufacturing capabilities and use instead as LFP or Lithium-manganese-oxide (LMO) that don't need cobalt is always an option. However, this might severely hamper competitiveness and quality. Substitution. ""Ceteris paribus"" is key here. A complete shift away from high-energy batteries looks hypothetical at this stage: NMC, NCA and LCO batteries provide the highest energy density as reported by Battery University, and all require cobalt. However, there has been recently efforts to produce other types of battery chemistries that do not require cobalt as stated by the CRU. Tesla has also been trying to remove cobalt from the equation and add nickel instead, according to its CTO JB Straubel. We may well see a quick turnaround from cobalt-intensive batteries toward a validated and optimized new high-energy battery technology should it go online. And the high costs triggered by a shift away from traditional batteries might prove beneficial when opposed with the prospects a cobalt cliff. So far attempts for substituting cobalt resulted in a loss in product performance. But nothing is set in stone. Demand for nickel. Let's assume for a second that the substitution project remains in draft and that cobalt remains indispensable. Around Ninety-five percent of the world's supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. As illustrated by John Petersen, ""Every year, the world's nickel miners sell $14.58 billion of nickel and $1.05 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 6.7% of their total revenue. It's even worse with copper miners who sell $68.4 billion of copper and $0.92 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 1.3% of their total revenue."" Certainly frightening numbers. Many mines have become a casualty of the low prices and many are being taken offline or ""placed on maintenance"" for an extended period of time until market prices justify further investments.

However, if it is well-established that the dependence on a primary product is a key supply risk, the opposite is also true. There will be cobalt if there is enough demand for the primary metals. It is unclear what the mix of Panasonic/Tesla's batteries is, but traditionally an NCA cathode is comprised of roughly 80 percent nickel and 15 percent cobalt. Increased demand for nickel may spur nickel production and, as a consequence, cobalt product. This may overall add some counterweight in the balance. Identified resources versus reserves. In addition, identified cobalt resources are much larger than existing reserves. According to the CDI, ""there seems to be enough known land sources of cobalt to last for at least 100 years and for many, many more years if speculative and hypothetical resources for deep sea, ocean floor resources are taken into account (about 120 million tonnes according to the USGS)."" The CDI thus remains confident that ""cobalt is not running out, but its availability will depend upon many factors such as accessibility, price, demand, technological development and global economic growth."" Obviously mining cobalt cheaply in deep water is nothing more than a bad science fiction movie, but should become economically viable (disruptive technologies might start showing their teeth, as we have witnessed in deep water drilling and more recently with fracking). Recycling. Cobalt (as opposed to oil, for instance) is fully recyclable. Roughly 15 percent of U.S. cobalt consumption is from recycled scrap today. For many applications, the metal is used but not consumed and so can be recycled. Needless to say that recycling can help reduce the need to hunt for new sources of cobalt. In no circumstances is this a magic solution whereby 100 percent can be recycled indefinitely. Existing processes are energy-consuming and can definitely be improved. But that is also an idea to weigh in the balance. Conclusion That's a lot of ""ifs,"" I grant you that. Tesla is entering an age of supply chain transparency, as Simon Moores from Benchmark Intelligence states, and it wouldn't hurt to see more communication from Tesla on that front. However, there are many factors that could be part of a complex cobalt equation. I wouldn't go as far as surrender already and turn into a structural Tesla bear.

The big caveat is that, like watching a stuntperson on TV, some of these feats are better watched than attempted. Many are risky or require a heck of a lot of luck.

That said, enjoy...

No. 1: Side-Hustling a Side Hustle

Uber has been a hit with anyone in a pinch for a ride, but it's not just Uber founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp that are making money. In 2015, Uber-preneur Gavin Escolar told Forbes that he's making nearly a quarter of a million dollars as an Uber driver.

He's accomplishing that feat largely thanks to a tactful display of hand-crafted jewelry he displays in his vehicle. Escolar soft-sells his jewelry to interested patrons after they've inquired about them, and his self-qualify approach translates into $18,000 per month in orders.

Many of Uber's drivers are entrepreneurs earning extra money on the side, and Escolar's success suggests that if you're a crafty self-starter with drive and a great product, then a Uber showroom could make you a success, too.

No. 2: Kickstarting it

Artists, filmmakers, and inventors are turning to Kickstarter to finance their dreams, and so far, 10 million Kickstarter investors have helped fund tens of thousands of projects, including Exploding Kittens , a wildly successful card game that has made Elan Lee, Matthew Inman, and Shane Small a pile of money.

Pick a card of a cat doing an explode-worthy shenanigan and you're out of luck, unless of course, you happen to hold a defuse card, such as catnip sandwiches. After putting the game up on the funding site Kickstarter, 219,382 backers pledged $8,782,571 to get their hands on Exploding Kittens.

Perennial fidgeters Matthew and Mark McLachlan also struck it rich on Kickstarter when the they created Fidget Cube, a small cube packed full of useless buttons and controls that are a fidgeter's dream -- and the source of millions of dollars. Support from 154,926 people contributing a combined $6,465,69 got this Kickstarter up and running.

The moral? Never underestimate the ability for a wacky, yet creative idea to put you on a path to riches.

No. 3: Pinch-hitting

Websites like Taskrabbit match up your extra time with busy people near you who need a helping hand with anything from running errands to building bookcases.

For instance, Taskers have climbed 4 million stairs moving furniture!

Even though many of these people are working part-time, 10% to 15% of these micro-entrepreneurs are hauling in tens of thousands of extra dollars every year.

Taskrabbit says that top producers can earn $6,000 to $7,000 a month, and in 2015, Brian Schrier told CNNMoney that he spends half his week working on his boat, and the other half tasking. Despite his non-full-time schedule, Schrier says he's pocketing the equivalent of $72,000 to $84,000 per year.

How long tasking takes to get you to the million-dollar mark will depend a lot on your commitment to it, and what you do with the money. If you task part-time, earn $25,000, and commit all of that income to investments yielding 6%, then you'd hit the million-dollar mark in 21 years. .

Okay, working extra for years in order to save and invest isn't the sexiest of concepts, but it's attainable and time-tested.

No. 4: Superhosting

Are you a hostess (or host) with the mostest? If so, then turning that extra space in your home, or your second home, into a top-rated Airbnb destination could help you hit 1 million dollars.

More than 1 million places in about 200 countries are listed on Airbnb, and savvy entrepreneurs are using Airbnb's marketing might to earn sizable amounts of money. Hoteliers may frown about it, but owners of multiple properties are successfully using Airbnb to fill up their properties year-round.

Top Airbnbers can generate high five- to six-figure incomes annually. For example, Canadian Gary Bearchell -- a ""superhost"" outside of Vancouver -- told Fast Company that he hoped to double his $30,000 in annual earnings by listing a second property in 2015.

Meanwhile, Scott Shatford, a Californian, told travel website Skift in 2015 that he's renting out five properties on Airbnb that are hauling in a combined ""six figures."" That's a lot of money, especially if it's in addition to your day job.

But similar to our eighth way to make a million dollars (flipping houses), this one can entail a lot of risk, especially if you're funding with debt.

No. 5: Gaming for major green

Your teen's gaming habits may tempt you to toss their gaming systems out the window, but a better idea may be to teach them a little about YouTube, because top YouTube gaming stars are hauling in seven figures annually by sharing their recordings online.

For instance, Bajan Canadian's YouTube channel, which includes more than 3,500 videos, mostly of him playing the popular Minecraft game, has garnered over 1.6 billion views. According to StatSheep, those views could be worth more than $4 million.

Bajun Canadian isn't the only one monetizing Minecraft , either. Some of the most popular YouTube channels, including Captain Sparkles, are run by gamers who are playing Minecraft . And, even if Minecraft isn't your thing, gamers are making big money posting videos of other games, too. For instance, ElRubiusOMG is reportedly bringing in seven figures annually from videos showing him playing Skyrim and Battlefield .

No. 6: Hand-crafting success

At one point, Alicia Shaffer was making $80,000 per month selling products on Etsy ( NASDAQ:ETSY ) , the online retailing site that's known for selling hand-crafted goods.

Shaffer's Three Birds Nest started out small, selling bohemian-inspired hats and scarves and earning a couple hundred dollars per month in the process. However, before long she was tapping Etsy's 30 million registered users for envy-inspiring paychecks.

The same is true for former teacher Erin True. True cut her e-retailing teeth on Etsy when she sold a reclaimed wooden bench on the site. Since then, her company Urban Woods Goods has become a million-dollar-plus operation that gets roughly one-quarter of its sales from Etsy customers.

Shaffer's left Etsy to pitch her wares on her own website, and Urban Woods Goods generates a lot of money from other sources now, but its success shows that business-minded craftspeople can make it big, even if they start out small.

No. 7: Brewing up millions

Co-founder and Chairman Jim Koch's famous love of beer has turned his Boston Beer Co. ( NYSE:SAM ) into a billion-dollar craft brew behemoth, but while Boston Beer is a legendary pioneer of the U.S. craft beer craze, he's not the only one who's making millions by scaling up tasty home brews.

Last year, Constellation Brands ( NYSE:STZ ) forked out $1 billion to buy California's Ballast Point Brewery, one of the nation's fastest-growing breweries. Founder Jack White left Ballast Point earlier this year to work on a spirits venture, but his 20-year history with Ballast Point is another example of how passion can produce profit.

Overall, thousands of homebrewing aficionados have taken the plunge and opened local breweries that could make them millionaires. In fact, there are over 4,000 craft breweries in the United States generating a combined $22 billion in retail sales every year. On the one hand, that's a lot of opportunity ... on the other, it's a lot of competition.

No. 8: Flipping houses

The housing market has come a long way since easy lending led to a deluge of bad loans that caused the Great Recession. Today, real estate markets are rebounding, and that's providing opportunities for people to buy homes in need of some TLC on the cheap in order to fix them and flip them for a profit.

Not everyone will make money flipping homes, but for people with a good eye for value and a network of contractors, flips can lead to tens of thousands in additional income per year.

For example, successful realtor Mark Ferguson manages a team of agents that sells more than 200 homes annually, and he flips 10 to 15 homes per year. Ferguson manages the real estate website www.investfourmore.com , and he says he makes up to $30,000, or more on each flip, depending on his purchase price and the total cost of repairs.

Of course, getting to Ferguson's level takes time, experience, and a willingness to take on risk. Often too much risk depending on debt levels.

Some of today's most sought-after musicians got their start by posting videos online, building up followers, and eventually, landing lucrative contracts.

Perhaps, the most successful of these musicians is Justin Bieber, who signed a record deal after his YouTube videos caught the eye of a talent agent. Since then, Bieber's become a music phenom with a reported annual income north of $60 million, and a net worth of around $200 million. Bieber brings in millions from his music, and he's also branched out into clothing and cologne.

Calvin Harris, a Scottish-born DJ, also owes some of his fame to humble internet beginnings. Harris' desire to be a DJ led to his creating a MySpace account that helped him catapult to international fame. Today, Harris is making an estimated $46 million annually from music, including gigs in which he can fetch as much as $300,000.

No. 10: Moonlighting

If you can convey a message in a way that resonates, build a website, or edit marketing copy like a champ, you can make significant money using websites like Upwork to match up your skills with small businesses that need a helping hand.

Often, small and mid-size companies require business tasks outside their employees' wheelhouse, and increasingly, they're turning to places like Upwork rather than hiring new full-time employees.

This trend is a boon to people with extra time on their hands who are eager to pad their paycheck, or to take the path less traveled and become self-employed. Earlier this year, contributor Laura Pennington wrote on the website SixFigureWritingSecrets.com that she was able to secure $2,000 worth of work in four days on Upwork.

Pennington's six-figure income shows that moonlighting can generate millionaire-making money, so if you're eager for a fresh start that can help you achieve financial security, now may be the perfect time to explore opportunities like this.

It's over! Now on to the next mess that will be 2017. And much as we have tooted the horn of how horrible 2016 was, we have challenges ahead.

Consider that San Francisco is, according to Curbed and the city controller , almost at its growth limit. Even if we built as much office space as legally possible in the city, the controller reports, companies that want to expand in the city have nowhere to go. Also, the city is facing budget shortfall projections of oh, you know, just $848 million by 2022 if it doesn't take corrective action. I'm sure it will, but that is a pretty impressive number!

Meanwhile, fewer major housing proposals started the application process for development this year, SocketSite report s, so depending on how you feel about... READ MORE

Last year, Nielsen reported the top two New Year's resolutions were to stay fit and to lose weight. Millions pledged to kick off 2016 with the definite goal to get in shape - but this year, you can expect the same old resolutions will likely top the list again.

After all, many of those people just repeat the same sentiment, year after year. In January, gyms will be filled with resolutioners trying to sweat away the worst of themselves. But by March, much of the New Year's crowd will have fallen away. Clearly, something isn't quite working.

Part of the problem might be that people just don't know how to get in shape. Without committing to major expenses and time sucks like personal training sessions or other classes, they're stuck to figure things out on their own. Research can provide a baseline training plan, but sticking to a routine with only self-discipline to keep you in check can be much harder than it sounds.

Like anything else, the right technology makes living the fit life much easier. Using apps and gadgets can help to keep resolutioners on the right path by tracking progress and providing feedback and insight into how best to approach training and exercise on the individual level.

But like any other training hack, the gadgets and apps listed below can only do so much for you. They're just smart tools to make the most of your hard work and sweaty hours on the trail and in the gym. At the end of the day, it's up to you to get moving, eat better and make the commitment to a healthier lifestyle.

Here are some of the best apps, wearables, gear and more to help you live a healthier, more active life in resolution season and all the way through the year.

Apps

Image: uarunfitness

The simplest of fitness apps, MapMyRun requires just one thing of its users: go running.

Armed with a smartphone and a good pair of sneakers, even the most sedentary resolutioner can become a super-smart jogger in no time without investing in a wearable or advanced tracker. Using the phone's built-in GPS, the app logs the most basic measures of a run, like distance, duration and approximate calories burned, which is all the information needed for beginners to get off to a good start.

Where MapMyRun really shines, though, is in its more advanced features. It can track speed, pace, elevation and the exact route covered by a run, which is recorded on a map layout. Advanced training options include preset running routes created by the user community, specialized workouts, training plans and sponsored challenges.

To make running more of a group activity, users can connect on social media and share workout stats to compete with friends and the larger MapMyRun community. Every workout logged is compared to community averages, so users always know where they stand.

Available for iOS and Android. Free (with in-app purchases).

Image: freeletics

Freeletics takes the minimalist approach of MapMyRun and expands on it, becoming an all-in-one personal trainer in your pocket with no need for additional equipment. Its main focus is convenience, fitting individually tailored workouts into the user's schedule no matter where they are.

While there are Running, Gym and Nutrition focuses of the service available, the real crown jewel is the Bodyweight app, which in 2013 was the first version to hit the market. Rather than going to the gym to exercise, Freeletics users are asked a few basic background questions and then given five to 30 minute training plans. These workouts only require a small open area to complete - in some cases, the app claims users only need 2x2 meters of space to get their sweat on.

To get more than just basic workouts out of Freeletics, individual coaching packages are available via in-app purchase. These provide a greater level of individualization and insight into the training process, along with ""psychological mechanisms"" (not to mention a financial incentive) to kickstart motivation.

Available for iOS and Android. Coaching packages start at $3.07/week for 3 months ($39.99).

Image: aaptive

Aaptive kicks the personal training aspects of other fitness apps up a notch, focusing on seven different popular workout styles - treadmill running, outdoor running, elliptical training, cycling, yoga, strength training and race training - to deliver classes led by nationally recognized trainers directly to the user.

The classes are audio-only, but that helps to make Aaptive's most appealing feature more attractive: all of the workouts are paired with a music playlist specially curated by its trainer. Instead of being forced to mimic the motions of a trainer, users can listen to the directions and allow the tempo of the music to push them forward in their workouts.

Aaptiv claims that over 150 classes are added to the app's repository each month, so the cost is somewhat justified by its wealth of options. Along with basic classes to set a fitness baseline, there are monthly challenges with targeted goals available to stay motivated throughout the year. One attractive feature for runners: the race training section, which includes plans to prepare for 5k races all the way up to marathons.

Available for iOS and Android. Subscriptions for unlimited access to classes cost $9.99/month.

Wearables

Image: moov inc.

There are a fair number of fitness wearables stuck on step counting, providing just a bit more insight into users' activities than a basic pedometer. The Moov Now is a direct repudiation of those, both in its function and its (relatively) low price. A pedometer-style wearable will help you understand where you're training is at, but the Moov will help you determine where you need to go.

Rather than just keeping a log of users' steps, the Moov Now actually tracks the specific motions associated with a range of fitness activities - running, swimming, boxing, cycling and general training are supported.

But the wearable, which is worn on the wrist or ankle, does more than just track the activity to provide a list of static data for the user to deliberate over. The connected Moov app acts as a personal coach, analyzing the wearer's motions to give real-time audio feedback on form and technique.

Price: $59.95 . Moov app available for iOS and Android.

Image: garmin

The Garmin vívoactive GPS smartwatch is an actual standalone wearable, cutting the proverbial Bluetooth cord from a paired smartphone (although there are extra features available via connected app). It has built-in GPS-enabled sports apps with specialized features for commonly tracked activities like running, biking, swimming and others that are less common, like skiing and golf.

Along with its standalone functionality, the vívoactive provides users with another notable feature for wrist wearables: a function to measure heart rate. In many cases, exercisers are stuck using chest straps to track their ticker. It's not the only smartwatch with the capability (Fitbit's Charge 2 boasts comparable tech), but paring it with the phone-free functionality makes the vívoactive a winner.

When users do choose to connect with a phone to use the app, they get most of the features that typically come along with a smartwatch: push notifications, message and call alerts and more, along with individualized training cues and coaching tips expected from a fitness-focused device.

Price: $199.99 . App available for iOS and Android.

Image: jabra

Forget AirPods - Jabra's Elite Sport earphones remove the wires and add fit-tracking wearable features.

As a pair of wireless earphones, the Elite Sport offers everything you'd expect: high-quality sound and noise-cancellation from two microphones in each bud, along with hands-free calling. Users can control basic music functions using built-in buttons on each ear bud. Like most other headphones designed for workouts, they're waterproof and sweat-resistant.

The buds also contain two sensors: a motion tracking and counting sensor for basic fitness functions and a clinical-grade, in-ear heart monitor. The information compiled by those sensors is then fed to the Sport Life companion app, which can provide training metrics and in-ear coaching for a variety of activities.

Price: $249.99 . App available for iOS and Android.

Smart training clothes

Image: hexoskin

Hexoskin takes the fitness tracking functions of other wearables, combines them with a whole array of other health metrics and weaves it all together into the fabric of a skintight training shirt.

Using a secondary movement sensor (seen in the image above), the Hexoskin system counts steps and measures activity intensity, peak acceleration, cadence and sleep positions. Its cardiac and breathing sensors, which are built into the shirt, make it a much more attuned tracker to a range of measures like heart rate, HRV, heart rate recovery, ECG and breathing rate.

Hexoskin's apps provide users similar functions for fitness activities as other wearables, but it's Connected Health Platform really takes advantage of the more advanced metrics. The system is used in the research of medical professionals across a range of fields like cardiology and neurology, which depend on the advanced data analytics software for long-term patient monitoring. Normal resolutioners might not need that much information in the short term, but in the long run it can give an in-depth look into the internal systems that make them tick.

Price: starting at $169 . Apps available for iOS and Android.

Image: athos

Athos is smart clothing designed to fine-tune its wearer's athletic performance to the highest possible level. It can be a full-body system, with shirts and leggings available, which house sensors integrated into the fabric that feed into a core device located on the sternum and thigh.

The sensors in the clothing don't just track the general motion of the body - they pinpoint individual movements and track the exertion of the major upper and lower body muscle groups. The system provides real-time biometric tracking, which is then fed to the connected mobile app to give real-time feedback on how the muscles of the wearer and working throughout the exercise.

This ultra-tailored feedback can give wearers (and their personal trainers) guidance to adjust training techniques to get the most out of their muscles. Athos isn't for casual wearers - this type of information is best in the hands of experts looking to push already elite exercisers over the top.

Price: starting at $348 . App for iOS only.

Gear

Image: push

The PUSH Band helps users and their trainers do one thing: make major gains in the weight room. The highly individualized tracking tool gives lift-specific performance feedback and insights. It's used by multiple professional and college athletic programs, so it has possibly the highest seal of approval.

The Band is strapped across the user's forearm and paired with an iOS app, which gives trainers immediate metrics like bar speed, which helps to establish a baseline for velocity-based training, a popular weight-room plan. Additional tools help to establish 1-rep max lift levels and other baseline measures which help to track progress.

Again, the PUSH Band is tech that's designed for advanced training plans, so it's not for beginners. Once you have a dedicated trainer who really knows their stuff, its an additional tool to take a high level of weight-room performance and push it to even greater heights.

Price: $289 . App for iOS only.

Image: stealth

Unlike the other items on this list, Stealth is focused on just one area of the body: the core. The system takes one of the most basic training exercises, the plank, and turns it into a full-on gaming experience.

The training platform is designed to turn the user's body into a joystick of sorts, with a rotational design for a full range of motion from the plank position. A slot houses a smartphone running the accompanying app, which uses the phone's built-in motion sensor to play an assortment of games designed to work up a sweat.

Right now, Stealth is raising funds on Kickstarter for a launch in the middle of next year. It's an interesting concept that someone on a year-long fitness kick might want to add to their training repertoire. Playing video games for a six-pack is definitely one of the most attractive training plans out there.

Price: $299 . App available for iOS and Android.

2431714905,"Dan Nicholson inspects shelving as he takes it out of the box. Nicholson left a career as a laser engineer to run his own business. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) Dan Nicholson tried to do the 9-to-5 thing. In 2007, armed with a physics degree from Purdue, he secured a job as a laser engineer. He had a salary and health insurance, plus he was using his degree, which is more than almost every English major can say.

But every day he was going through the motions; checking off boxes; adhering to strict protocols.

""And I was just thinking: If I do this for 20 years, I will be able to talk to .01 percent of the population about this useless thing I'm doing,"" he said.

He couldn't hide his disillusionment and lost his job.

But subconsciously, he had a backup plan: All day at the lab he fantasized about working on houses. And that's how he became HandyDan - a guy who specializes in fixing anything that might go wrong with your home.

As the new year rolls around and people start to talk resolutions, it's a timely moment to ask ourselves if we're doing what we really want to be doing. Like HandyDan, many people have alter egos - if only in their imaginations - living a more fulfilled life in some parallel universe.

These dream lives tend to fall under two umbrellas. Ask a random sampling of Washingtonians and you'll find that many want to be closer to nature. They want to settle somewhere in the Caribbean and manage a store or restaurant. Maybe rent paddle boards to tourists. Or sit on a sailboat and just float around.

The second category of people want to create something tangible. The pharmaceutical researcher visiting from Columbus, Ohio, who hoped to turn his carpentry hobby into a full-time gig; a guy who does tech support but would rather be making movies; a legal fellow who dreams of being a full-time writer. She can even imagine her office: a room of her own somewhere remote, probably Iowa.

Some people will tell you, without the briefest contemplation, that they're living the dream. (Especially lawyers.)

But for everyone else, what does it say that these dream lives are so at odds with reality?

It turns out there's an explanation. Let's start with nature. When we're overtaxed mentally, an urge to surround ourselves with plants and oceans grows. In ""The Myths of Happiness,"" psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky explains that sitting on a tree stump in the forest or reclining on the sand listening to the waves frees us up mentally to experience life through all our senses.

Flipping constantly between Facebook friend requests and Twitter notifications and the little email alert window isn't natural. Just look at the 2014 Stanford University study that found multitasking to be both counterproductive and potentially damaging to our brains. Meanwhile, It leaves space for creative thinking.

Jenniffer Green, a life coach and self-proclaimed ""get your s--- together ninja,"" says our hankering for the outdoors comes from the same place as our longing to be creative.

""Most of my clients have this overwhelming desire to create or be in nature,"" she said. ""And I think that that's due to the fact that people are craving that connection with themselves.""

One of Green's solutions is having her clients schedule ""play time"": no-stakes activities that give people the chance to slow down and use their brains in ways that they haven't in a while.

When the burdens of modern life weigh people down, a huge life change is tempting. Rather than making incremental adjustments, better to just quit your job, flush your cellphone and move to an island.

Or maybe there's a way to find compromise.

Think of the nine-to-fivers whose crafty hobbies become another income stream, thanks to Etsy. Sometimes technology, though it hobbles us, also helps.

Telecommuting was the trick for government consultant Andrew MacDonald. The New Zealand native works for a company he loves, but something wasn't right. Maybe it was the District's career-first attitude and the limitless appetite for getting ahead.

""It can't all be work,"" he said. ""I absolutely refuse to live my life being defined only by my job.""

So he made a deal with his boss. Now he works in the District for one week a month and does his job remotely from Austin the other three, which is more conducive to pursuing his musical interests.

To his friends in Texas, he's not a consultant. He's the guy playing banjo and guitar.

The recent craze for all things artisanal has been a siren song for office workers who want to leave cubicle life and work with their hands. That's what Yael Krigman did in 2011 when she quit her job as an international trade lawyer to bake cake pops. (They're exactly what they sound like: balls of cake covered in frosting served on a stick.) Five years later, Baked by Yael has graduated from a one-woman operation based in a synagogue to an airy, colorful brick-and-mortar shop on Connecticut Avenue right across from the National Zoo.

In her past life, Krigman wanted nothing more than to become an associate. But when she finally reached that point, it wasn't all she thought it would be. She was working in abstractions, writing briefs for people she'd never even meet. Now she creates something tangible (not to mention delicious), and she gets to see her customers' delight firsthand.

""When you're a lawyer, no one's really happy to see you,"" she said. ""Typically it's because you're in trouble or you might be in trouble or you want to avoid being in trouble. It's not usually a happy experience."" Nicholson evaluates a shelf installation. He has had a tool box since he was 10 years old. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post) For HandyDan, his current gig as the one-man operation behind his company Savings del Sol plays to his strengths. Curious and energetic, the 32-year-old likes the fact that every day is different. He says it suits his ADHD.

""I've done things as simple as cutting a woman's roast in half so she could cook it to redoing someone's basement,"" he said.

He's constantly problem-solving, figuring out how to create a more sustainable house (geothermal heating and cooling) or the best way to install a new staircase. Plus he gets a workout while he does it.

Not that it's been easy. He's had to tutor, rent out rooms in his house and work constantly to stay afloat.

Being self-employed may seem like a solution, but it isn't easy. A lot of small businesses fail. Just like the 9-to-5 thing, it's not for everyone.

Emily Robins left a high-stress, good-paying office job to start Goldilocks Goodies, a gluten-free baked goods company. Her friends thought her life was all pink frosting and perfectly domed cupcakes, when in reality, it was physically demanding and ""not glamorous by any means,"" she said.

She used to sleep about three hours a night, and when she had a 30-minute gap in her schedule, she wondered whether to shower, nap or eat. She missed paid vacations. She missed sleep.

In April, she shut down production after 4½ years.

There's no one right path for everyone, and each one has its own risks. So, for those who aren't living their dream lives, what's the best next step? You might start by sitting on a beach. Just leave your phone at home.

2431719942,"ONE of the remarkable stories of 2016 was the continued growth of downtown Bellevue.

While Seattle's Amazon-fueled construction boom drew most of the attention, Bellevue experienced it's own surge of new office and apartment buildings .

This pattern, and Bellevue's capacity to accommodate more of the region's new jobs and residents, is an important consideration as growth policies evolve.

Bellevue is addressing this in part by updating plans for the downtown , Bel-Red and Wilburton areas.

Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.

City Council member Kevin Wallace, a developer, notes that those areas combined have roughly the same acreage as Seattle's central core, from CenturyLink Field to South Lake Union and Elliott Bay to Broadway on Capitol Hill.

Simultaneously, the Puget Sound Regional Council is updating plans for regional centers where growth will be concentrated through 2040.

Room to expand in Bellevue and other urban centers around Puget Sound should also be part of Seattle discussions about how much more growth to shoehorn into areas that are at capacity.

Bellevue's surge in 2016 shows, though, that it can be tricky to foresee growth.

At the start of the year, some predicted a glut of office space in Bellevue. The combination of new buildings under construction and big companies moving out suggested a rough patch ahead.

It turned out there was actually significant demand, particularly among tech companies, for more space in Bellevue's increasingly dynamic downtown.

Yes, one of Bellevue's largest employers, Expedia, is moving to Seattle in a few years, relocating thousands of jobs. Microsoft, which occupies about a fifth of downtown Bellevue office space, may eventually relocate more workers to its Redmond campus.

But in the meantime, other companies are expanding from Seattle to the Eastside or expanding their Eastside presence.

During the third quarter, 1.1 million square feet of office space was under construction in Bellevue, comparable to the 1.3 million feet under construction in Seattle's South Lake Union area, according to real-estate company Jones Lang LaSalle. Overall, 1.6 million feet was under construction on the Eastside and 4.8 million feet in Seattle.

Tech companies are claiming most of the space.

Bellevue gaming giant Valve is nearly doubling its downtown presence, leasing nearly a third of the new Lincoln Square office tower.

Another new Bellevue office building was entirely leased by Amazon.com. It took space Apple was rumored to be considering. The 16-story Centre 425 building gives Amazon flexibility similar to Google, which has long had campuses on both sides of Lake Washington.

Companies used to be interested in just one side of the lake or the other, according to Bret Jordan, managing director at Colliers in Bellevue. Now, the commercial real-estate company markets both sides at once.

That regional view is a good one for both policymakers and residents to take as they plan and prepare for future growth.

2431720644,"Elon Musk on the 3 inventions that will change the world

Elon Musk is a 39-year-old engineer and serial entrepreneur. At 28, he co-founded popular e-payment company Paypal. He then went on to start SpaceX, the first private company to launch a rocket into space, and Tesla Motors, which builds electric cars.

I recently talked to Musk about inventions he thinks will change the world. You can check out the transcript below and watch part of our Skype conversation, which encapsulates Musk's particular brand of big, big thinking (in particular, why we should expand human life into space).

Amar Bakshi: What three inventions do you foresee changing the world in the years ahead?

Elon Musk: One of the most important things that I think that will be invented this century, hopefully by SpaceX, is the first (1) fully reusable orbital rocket. It's the fundamental invention necessary for humanity to expand to the stars and to become multiplanetary. (Check out the video above to see why Musk thinks expanding to the stars is important for humanity.)

The cost of fuel is only about 0.2% or 0.3% of the cost of the rocket. In fact, the cost to refuel one of our Falcon 9 rockets is about as much as the cost to refuel a Boeing 747 plane.

However, a 747 can be used tens of thousands of times. And that's the reason a ticket to London doesn't cost a half a billion dollars (a 747 is about a quarter-billion dollars, and you would need two of them for a round-trip flight if you didn't have reusable planes). Now you're paying a few thousand dollars for the ticket because you can reuse the craft.

(2) Rapid, low-cost, perfect DNA sequencing will have a huge effect on humanity. Human DNA has not yet been completely decoded. The most that anyone has gotten is about 91% or 92%, and that has been with a huge numbers of errors. Trying to read our DNA is like trying to understand software code - with only 90% of the code riddled with errors. It's very difficult in that case to understand and predict what that software code is going to do.

That's where things are right now in DNA decoding. There's a company called Halcyon that's trying to solve that problem. I'm an investor, and I'm on the Board of Halcyon, but I think if Halcyon succeeds in doing perfect DNA sequencing, it will have a huge impact on humanity.

I should mention another important thing. With DNA, you have to be able to tell which genes are turned on or off. Current DNA sequencing cannot do that. The next generation of DNA sequencing needs to be able to do this. If somebody invents this, then we can start to very precisely identify cures for diseases. It will be a really huge advancement for humanity.

We'll be able to design treatments specifically for individual people and be able to tell beforehand if certain treatments would result in negative side effects for certain individuals.

There are a lot of people that think (3) viable fusion is not possible. But fusion is the ""energy forever"" solution. You know all energy in the universe originates with fusion. We get our energy from the sun, so that's indirect reliance on fusion.

Do I think it will be solved this century? It may not be possible - or at least, not on a commercially viable scale. It's a very, very difficult technical problem, one of the most difficult technical problems that humanity will ever try to solve. But if we solve it, we will have ""energy forever.""

Bakshi: Where do you think these innovations are going to happen? Around the world? Or mostly on the west coast of the U.S.?

Musk: Primarily the west coast of the U.S. It is remarkable how much is invented in California. It's kind of ridiculous. It's not necessarily the people who were born in California. It's just that people come here because this is an environment that is really conducive to invention despite the high taxes and all the constraints that one faces.

I was born in Africa. I came to California because it's really where new technologies can be brought to fruition, and I don't see a viable competitor. It's not to say that California is perfect - far from it. But it's the least imperfect of any place in the world that I know of for bringing new inventions to mass market.

Silicon Valley has evolved a critical mass of engineers and venture capitalists and all the support structure - the law firms, the real estate, all that - that are all actually geared toward being accepting of startups.

You go to some other part of the world, and you know you can't get a lease because your company hasn't been around long enough; the law firm won't give you legal advice, nobody will give you funding, you can't find the technical talent you need. But in California, all this has arisen organically.

2431720660,"For a good portion of his career, Bobby Braun has wrestled with the technological challenges of putting spacecraft on Mars. His landing in Boulder, where he'll take over in January as dean of the University of Colorado's College of Engineering and Applied Science , proved a long-awaited but less complicated re-entry.

RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post

Robert ""Bobby"" Braun

Continuing a career that includes a recent turn as NASA's chief technologist, the 51-year-old Braun brings decades of research, management and collaboration in both academia and the public sector to a school he sees at a nexus of research and industry. After he left NASA, he had several inquiries from schools looking to capitalize on his experience.

CU simply made sense.

""The state has such strong industry, not just in aerospace, but in energy, in robotics, in software, in chemical and biological fields,"" Braun says. ""I'm someone that likes to do research that is a benefit to industry. It just seemed like a natural place for me at some point. It took awhile to figure out what I should be doing out here.""

Braun takes over from Robert Davis, a 34-year member of the CU faculty and dean of the college since 2002, who will return to a faculty position.

A Washington, D.C., native and son of an electrical engineer and a social worker, Braun has the kind of broad and distinguished portfolio that will raise the college's profile, says Penny Axelrad, chair of CU Boulder's aerospace engineering sciences department.

""I think we'll get a bump from his reputation,"" Axelrad says, ""and I think that will focus some attention on us. People always say we're the best kept secret and we all keep saying, 'Why are we keeping it a secret?' I think he'll do good job helping let the secret out.""

That's precisely Braun's intent.

""There are some real stellar faculty in this college who are largely unknown to the world,"" he says. ""They're great teachers, great researchers, but outside of Boulder on the national scene, they may not be as well known as, frankly, they should be. I felt I could help elevate them onto the national stage a little bit.""

Since 2010, Braun has been making annual trips to Colorado to meet with sponsors of his research, including Ball Aerospace, Sierra Nevada Corp. and Lockheed Martin. Last year, he was the keynote speaker at a CU symposium in Vail and recently attended the university's Grand Challenge , which explores solutions to worldwide issues.

But as far back as 1991, when he was driving cross-country from NASA's Langley Research Center to California, where he would begin his doctorate at Stanford, he has had Boulder on his mind. On that trip, he stopped off to pick up a buddy in Denver, and they all wound up crashing at a friend's house in Boulder - Braun's introduction to the college town.

""To be honest, it was so much fun, I thought of staying,"" he recalls.

But it would be decades before the stars aligned. Meanwhile, he worked for NASA in several capacities, spent time at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California Institute of Technology and 13 years at Georgia Tech, where he founded the school's space technology and research center . Along the way, he conducted work on multiple space systems, several of them Mars-related and dealing with his specialty - entry, descent and landing technology.

Braun had a hand in Mars Pathfinder in 1996 and the Sojourner rover , which landed a year later - and worked on every Mars landing since.

""Successes and failures,"" he says.

In 2010, he became NASA's chief technologist, a position that helped guide the agency's direction and advocate for the budget to fund it. Braun worked out of Washington, D.C., most of the week while still flying back to Atlanta on Fridays to work with students at Georgia Tech and then carve out some family time on the weekend.

Braun was constantly pressing Congress for a more robust budget to advance technology that would produce payoffs not only for the space agency, but for the inevitable spinoffs, says Keith Cowing, editor at the industry website NASA Watch .

""So he was in a position to try and just be almost an evangelist for taking advantage of new technology, trying to weave it all together,"" Cowing says. ""Going to other planets and doing things in space could be not only cheaper but more productive in the long run.

""He was a techno-evangelist.""

But in 2011, Braun announced that he wouldn't be coming back for another two-year stint and returned full-time to Georgia Tech. He says that having kids in high school drove his decision to quit splitting time between Washington and home. But once all three kids were in college, he and his wife decided that if they were going to try something new, this would be the time.

Cowing figures academia offers a perfect outlet for someone with Braun's ambitious agenda.

""I think he's a colossal find for the folks in Boulder,"" he adds. ""With Bobby, it's not just Bobby, but the people he's going to recruit to work there. I'd keep an eye out for who else starts to show up there once he's in his office.""

Waleed Abdalati - director of the Boulder-based Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , which partners with CU - overlapped with Braun for about a year at NASA. Abdalati was chief scientist, a position with common functions to the chief technologist but in different areas.

He notes that Braun didn't hesitate to back him - an approach that he sees reinforcing the sense that the new dean will take a broad view to improving the engineering school beyond his own interest in aerospace.

""He's effective in persuasion,"" Abdalati says. ""I don't mean like in a sales sense, but making logical, rational, reasoned arguments in the interest of moving forward and accomplishing what he perceives to be the right thing. It's not simply getting what he wants. He really takes the time to figure out, very thoughtfully, what the right thing is, the best path forward given the objectives at hands.""

Braun outlines four general areas where he hopes to have an impact as dean: research, education, reach and culture.

He praises the research arm of the college that already has a national reputation and voices a desire to grow its impact - ""with industry, with federal government, in an entrepreneurial way in terms of spinning out companies and creating jobs,"" he says. ""If the state of Colorado wants to build high-tech jobs for the future, there's no better way to do that than by investing in an engineering college, particularly one as strong as this one.""

Academically, he wants to make CU's engineering school ""the destination for all qualified students in the state of Colorado."" To that end, he envisions ramping up partnership opportunities with other Colorado schools, including community colleges.

Faced with challenges in areas such as water, energy, population growth and agriculture - problems without national boundaries - Braun wants the college's research and the students it produces to have an increasingly global reach. That means increasing the number of international students on campus as well as the number of CU students who participate in international programs.

Finally, he hopes to push back against the caricature of engineers as one-dimensional, data-driven drones with pocket-protectors by ""providing a broad educational experience that includes business and some entrepreneurial skills for some of the students, or includes some humanities skills, communications skills, team skills.""

""I want to make this a place that people want to be,"" he says.

Throughout his career, he has been an advocate for pushing boundaries of high-risk, high-reward research, whether at the university level or at NASA. That won't change with his arrival in Boulder.

""It's true that failure is not an option when you're dealing with human life,"" Braun says, referencing NASA's human spaceflight program. ""But when you're dealing with research, failure is an option. If failure is not an option, I'd argue you're not innovating at a sufficient pace. And your results are not going to have the impact you want.

""To me, it all comes back to impact.""

LONDON - The sheer number of people we now encounter in the digital space on a daily basis is, to me, overwhelming.

As someone whose friends and family are spread around the globe, I am grateful for the possibilities that social media affords - I FaceTime my mom everyday and participate in an ongoing multi-platform discussion on the (many) merits of falafels with my college roommate who now lives 3,500 miles away.

But there's a point when the internet's many communication channels stop being useful and become an extrovert's tool for torturing the introvert .

Let me elaborate. When I receive a Facebook message, text, email etc., I meet the notification with a degree of anxiety and dread. It's wonderful to hear from friends and family, but depending on the sender, it seems that a ticking bomb comes attached to the message. If I don't reply within some unknown allotment of time, the bomb will go off, and I will have been complicit in the ultimate social atrocity.

My palms grow sweaty.

In my mind, I buy myself time from the obligation of responding until I open the message. ""Oh, well she hasn't read it yet"" somehow absolves you from your crime - for a period. But I ask, why is that better? Confession: I know you've sent it, and I acknowledge that you may have your own anxieties in awaiting my response - I'm choosing to ignore it. I feel guilt, but also a horrible glee because why should you dictate my life?

You are stealing my precious people juice with your expectations.

At this point, I'm refusing to even read a message out of fear that I won't have the the time - or people juice - to craft an adequate response to its contents within whatever arbitrary time period is socially acceptable. I'm on the verge of developing resentment towards a perfectly friendly offer to catchup over drinks on a Friday night, or damaging a professional relationship by ignoring the sender. I feel guilty, and I feel stressed by the accumulation of digital clutter in both my personal and work life that have human expectations on the other end.

This needs to stop, and the answer does not lie in fueling the instant gratification many have come to crave and even expect in the evolving mass addiction spawned by social media

Part of this sense of anxiety stems from the fact that there is no clear-cut communication etiquette for instant messaging platforms, and different people have different expectations. When I said that extroverts torture introverts using social media, I should clarify that I find it unlikely that the extrovert views the exchange in those terms. However, providing people who enjoy constant human interaction with a direct channel to people who don't at times feels, well, sadistic. Don't get me wrong - introverts derive plenty of use from the internet . But if you remove the social distance allowed by the web and insist on immediacy, the largeness of social networks becomes potentially terrifying to the solitarily inclined.

Furthermore, in the digital space we lose the subtleties of body language and inflection present in face-to-face conversations - an emoji only goes so far, and studies show people tend to interpret the expressions in drastically different ways. For the more introspective communicator, crafting an appropriate and thoughtful reply may be more of a priority than speed - it isn't fair to disregard this profound variation in personality.

Image: CHRISTOPHER MINESES / MASHABLE

The introvert faces an excruciating dilemma here: do they risk violating social codes, or betray their very identity?

A small aside: the workplace presents a different conundrum altogether when we venture into the protocol of professionalism. Addressing the finer points of email decorum and subsidiary communication tools in the office would warrant another piece altogether, so for now suffice to say that France has the right idea .

When you've known a person for a period of time and become familiar with their unique style of communicating, the anxiety lessens. My closest friends are very aware that lack of an immediate reaction or a simple 'thumbs up' reply is not a reflection of how I value them as individuals. Things start to get hairy when we enter the world of acquaintances, love interests, and fringe members of our social circles. The introvert faces an excruciating dilemma here: do they risk violating social codes, or betray their very identity?

It isn't just the introvert that serves to lose out here, though. Any individual that doesn't wish to be enslaved to a screen is impacted. Having the ability to communicate instantly certainly has vast benefits, but there is no line drawn as to where it ends. Maybe I've been watching too much Black Mirror , but walking through a city and observing every other head bent towards a screen has unnerving implications for our future. Granted, instant messaging is only a part of it, but I fear we risk feeding the technology addiction by pandering to this urgency in replying instantaneously.

A final thought in the interest of fairness: I will concede that at times I am an absolute pain in the ass - in instances that warrant a quick reply, sometimes I could do better.

To that I say, I am truly sorry. And also, there is an archaic device known as a telephone where you can reach me in a prompt manner.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - The South Carolina 2018 governor's race was supposed to be wide open, with the departure of popular Republican Nikki Haley, term-limited from seeking a third run. Now, with Haley's potential early departure pending her confirmation as U.N. ambassador, a space has been created for current Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster - who will step in if Haley's confirmed - to run as an incumbent next year.

The Democratic side remains clear, with a few names tossed around but no candidate commitments. But with the state's politics trending more and more conservative over the past decade or more, attention is focused on the potential pool of candidates who will vie for the Republican nomination. McMaster is getting a lot of attention, but will he get some GOP company on primary ballots?

___

THE INCUMBENT

McMaster, 69, is a veteran of politics, both as a candidate but also a party leader helping shape the process. Serving as U.S. Attorney under President Ronald Reagan, McMaster also led South Carolina's GOP and was the state's attorney general for eight years.

He sought the state's office in 2010, when he finished third in a four-way Republican primary ultimately won by Haley. He backed Haley and led her transition efforts, as well as an ethics committee she created to make reform recommendations.

Haley was re-elected in 2014, and McMaster was elected separately as lieutenant governor. Starting in 2018, governor and lieutenant governor will be elected on the same ticket, so McMaster could have the opportunity to pick his No. 2.

A member of South Carolina's GOP establishment, McMaster went outside those boundaries early last year when he became the nation's first statewide officeholder to back Donald Trump for president. The move stunned political observers, but McMaster's support never wavered, despite Democrats' calls to withdraw it.

The move has now seemingly paid off, with Trump's nomination of Haley clearing McMaster's pathway to the governor's office, a post he's always wanted.

He's said little so far about what he'll do as governor, but McMaster has told The Associated Press in several interviews since Trump's election he'll do whatever he can to support the new president on the state's behalf.

___

THE OUTSIDER

Although she's never sought elected office, Catherine Templeton is no stranger to politics. The labor lawyer and union-fighting specialist was mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. labor secretary after she was summoned to Trump Tower for a meeting with the president-elect.

Templeton has earned a reputation in South Carolina for having a no-nonsense approach to getting things done. She ran the state's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation early in Haley's first term, cutting out redundancies and streamlining the agency. Haley played up Templeton's union-fighting background and ability to keep unions out of the new Boeing Inc. assembly plant in North Charleston. After a lawsuit over comments Haley made about the duo's ability to ""fight the unions"" at Boeing, the International Association of Machinists ultimately canceled a vote to certify the union.

Templeton served Haley a second time, directing South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, the state's largest agency. As Ebola concerns swirled in late 2014, Templeton said her agency needed the ability to send simultaneous health alerts to hospitals on the front lines of identifying a potential outbreak. The director herself even tested the state's abilities, showing up at two Charleston hospitals and said she was suffering from the flu, in an attempt to see if hospitals were really ready to tackle identifying an unknown outbreak.

Templeton has said she's exploring a gubernatorial bid but has made no official announcement.

___

THE PROSECUTOR

As a solicitor in the 1990s, Tommy Pope launched to nationwide fame for his case against Susan Smith, the Union County mother who killed her two sons by rolling her car into a lake. Pope pursued the death penalty against Smith, who was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.

Voters picked Pope to represent Rock Hill in the state House in 2010 and now, recently re-elected for a fourth term, he serves as House speaker pro tem. During last year's legislative session, Pope was chief sponsor of an ultimately successful ethics bill pushed by Haley.

Pope was the first Republican to officially say he'd run for governor after Haley's time was up, announcing in 2014 he'd make a run for the state's top slot. Pope's biggest challenge, if he sticks with the bid, will be to boost his name recognition across the state.

___

THE OTHERS

Many other Republicans have already been mentioned as potential 2018 gubernatorial hopefuls, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and state Sen. Tom Davis, a libertarian-leaning state senator recently elected to a third term representing some of South Carolina's coastal areas.

Yancey McGill, who briefly served as lieutenant governor, has previously said he'll run next year. Tim Scott, a widely popular black Republican who just won his first full term in the U.S. Senate, recently said he hasn't ruled out a bid. U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney had been considered a potential candidate until his recent nomination to serve as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget.

As for the Democrats, the only apparent certainty is that two-time nominee Vincent Sheheen won't be making a third gubernatorial bid. State lawmakers Brad Hutto and James Smith are often mentioned as potential candidates, although neither has committed to running.

2431730110,"London (AFP) - Olivier Giroud stole the show as the Arsenal striker's outrageous ""scorpion kick"" stung Crystal Palace and inspired his side's 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Giroud produced an audacious mid-air shot from behind his back to open the scoring and illuminate a dank afternoon in north London with one of the goals of the season.

The France international's breath-taking strike deserves to be ranked alongside any of the wonder goals conjured by Arsenal legends Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp.

Fittingly, it came in the 200th league match at the Emirates and provided the foundation for a win that was confirmed by Alex Iwobi 's second-half goal, keeping third-placed Arsenal nine points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea.

A second successive win following consecutive pre-Christmas defeats offers Arsenal renewed hope of a sustained title challenge in 2017.

But while the specifics of this otherwise routine victory will soon fade, the memory of Giroud's gem will remain emblazoned in the minds of all who were privileged enough to witness it.

Palace won't feel quite so warm and fuzzy about a defeat that leaves them without a win in two matches under new boss Sam Allardyce and just two points above the relegation zone.

Despite the absence of ill playmaker Mesut Ozil, Arsenal started brightly and went close to an early goal when Nacho Monreal 's cross eluded Giroud and ran to the back post, where Iwobi teed up Mohamed Elneny for a shot that deflected over.

Alexis Sanchez was next to threaten as the Arsenal forward cleverly worked himself into space on the edge of the penalty area before unleashing a fierce strike that curled just wide.

Sweeping forward with typically extravagant passing moves, Arsenal looked at their elegant best and never more so than when Giroud opened the scoring in the 17th minute.

- Exquisite -

When Arsenal took possession on the edge of their own penalty area, Palace's overwhelmed players must have hoped for a moment's respite.

But the Gunners launched a ruthless counter-attack as a flurry of one-touch passing moved the ball out to Sanchez on the left of the Palace box.

Sanchez's cross was just behind the diving Giroud but the Frenchman's reaction was exquisite as he flicked his left foot behind him to guide an instinctive shot over Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey and in off the crossbar.

Giroud's seventh goal of what had previously been an underwhelming season for the 30-year-old was such a bolt from the blue that even the man himself, grinning from ear to ear, wore the incredulous look of someone who couldn't believe what he'd just done.

Anything either team accomplished for the rest of the half seemed prosaic in comparison, although that didn't stop Arsenal pressing for a second goal as Elneny drove a low shot just wide.

Sanchez should have doubled Arsenal's lead seconds before the interval, but he rushed his close-range effort and Hennessey saved with his legs.

Palace had barely reached the Arsenal penalty area in the first half, but they almost snatched an equaliser immediately after the interval when Christian Benteke headed wide from Andros Townsend's cross.

That miss was Palace's one and only chance to snatch a point and Iwobi delivered the knockout blow in the 56th minute.

Sanchez passed to the over-lapping Monreal and the left-back's cross was deflected high into the air and, with the Palace defence statuesque, Iwobi had all the time he needed to loop his header over Hennessey.

2431730836,"A lot of New Year's resolutions are aimed at springing into action-whether the goal is losing weight, finding love or moving to a new city. But my main priority now is learning to be still. And the Chinese concept of wu wei-strategic non-action-has helped me do just that.

The Tao Te Ching, written in China around 600 BC, first articulated the idea of wu wei. ""Do that which consists in taking no action and order will prevail,"" the book explains. The idea is that we should stop trying to force action and get comfortable doing less. Then, when we do move, our actions are natural, energetic, and accomplish the desired results.

The Tao Te Ching recommends cultivating non-action by observing the natural world. The skies don't always storm; nor are birds always in flight. Stillness preserves us for action when necessary. The Taoist storyteller Chuang Tzu explains the idea further around 350 BC: ""From the sage's emptiness, stillness arises; From stillness, action. From action, attainment."" Wu wei is also an essential element of the influential strategy guide The Art of War, adored by business types.

There's no precise translation for wu wei in English. Philosopher Alan Watts preferred the term ""not forcing."" Watts believed that the concept is critical for learning to live a good life, but very difficult for Americans to understand. In an action-oriented culture, doing nothing sounds dumb. Who ever made a million bucks doing nothing?

I once felt a similar resistance to the idea of wu wei. Patience, though a virtue, is not my strong suit. I like to achieve and check off accomplishments. But in recent years, I began to notice that my busy, industrious attitude didn't seem to be doing much for me.

In 2012, I was an underemployed lawyer in Brooklyn, doing temporary work by day and painting street art at night. I was worried sick about the future and even considered applying to medical school just to have some plan, but I was already drowning in law school debt. (Plus, I feel sick at the sight of blood.)

So I made myself stop pushing, which isn't my style. I relied instead on the certainty that things would change, memorizing passages of the Tao Te Ching so as not to think about the unknowable future. I'd been reading the book over and over since I was 16, but only at 40 did it really sink in. It reminded me that non-action can be a power move, when it's deliberate. Being still requires courage and confidence that there is a place for you in a big, chaotic universe. So I stored up energy, knowing that things would change. And when they did, they changed fast.

My husband and I both landed brief-12-week-gigs on the same legal document review team at Google in California in July 2013. In the space of just 10 days, we packed and crossed the country in a rented car, exchanging a Brooklyn studio for a cabin in the Santa Cruz mountains.

We loved the mountains. But Google, a fascinating workplace, got weird. Working at such an enormous corporation got me thinking about the fine line between utopia and dystopia-and the accidental menace of friendly giants. Working there made me want to write again, a prior profession. But I wasn't sure how to go back.

So once again, I tried not trying. Obviously, I made an effort to get what I wanted, writing voraciously. But the effort wasn't a constant one. For example, last January, I spotted a job posting at Quartz that excited me. Yet I didn't apply. The timing wasn't right. Six months later, I spotted the posting again, and applied: Silence, then a flurry of activity.

Now comes the part that's a little hard for me to admit. But framing outcomes neutrally-also a Taoist notion-helps us to manage reality. So the truth is that I didn't get the precise job I applied for. But I do write for Quartz. There was a place for me-and it's evolving.

Wu wei shows that when we stop making waves, and learn to wait and watch, we see outside forces more clearly and make wiser moves. Act hastily, and every step is a potential blunder, with emotion and ego driving our decisions more than reason.

Now I know that, like all creatures, I have a finite amount of energy. By not acting, we conserve energy so that we can expend it when the moment is right. So wu wei isn't about resignation or laziness. It's about self-preservation-an important skill. As 2017 begins, I'm sitting still: attentive and ready.

On Christmas Eve, my four year old daughter was opening her Star Wars Lego advent calendar. The little door swung back to reveal a miniature Chewbacca. ""Oh,"" said Olivia sadly. ""I really wanted Princess Leia.""

The loss of Carrie Fisher, aged just 60, is a seminal moment in history for those of us who grew up with her Star Wars alter-ego. For me, as a little girl in the seventies, she was part of the holy trinity of badass female icons: Princess Leia, Wonder Woman and Miss Piggy.

The boys could run around the playground pretending to be Luke Skywalker or Han Solo, but they could not deny Leia's power. She could handle a blaster, she had serious attitude and all the best lines - ""Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?"" She could repair spaceships and lead rebel troops to victory. Princess Leia was not there to look beautiful: she was the boss.

Behind the scenes though, the struggle for intergalactic equality was real. When asked why Leia never had a lightsaber, Fisher quipped ""Even in space, there's a double standard."" Ordered by director George Lucas to go braless because ""There's no underwear in space"", Leia was later humiliated by Jabba the Hutt in that gold bikini. At least she had the pleasure of strangling him. ""That's the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster."" How ironic that Princess Leia was handing out medals for bravery at the end of A New Hope . She should have awarded one to herself.

As the years went by, I lost touch with Leia. Then in 2011, I happened to watch Carrie Fisher's one-woman show Wishful Drinking and was blown away by her self-deprecating humour and acerbic wit. Here was a woman who could create a flow chart about her Dad running off with Elizabeth Taylor and still make it hilarious. She acknowledged that Princess Leia would forever be a part of her life ""I've sort of melded with her over time,"" but had made peace with that. For Carrie, being turned into a PEZ dispenser was the epitome of cool.

Most striking though was Fisher's account of her journey through addiction to being diagnosed as bipolar. It takes enormous courage for any person - let alone a world famous movie star - to confess they have been psychotic, admitted to a mental hospital or undergone ECT (electroconvulsive therapy).

Carrie's voice when she talked about her demons was searingly honest yet reassuringly light-hearted. ""I'm totally sane about how crazy I am."" Her popular agony aunt column for the Guardian newspaper is still receiving letters after her death. Like millions of her fans, corny as it sounds, I felt as if I knew her.

Typically, it was these fans that Fisher mercilessly ridiculed in her recent memoir The Princess Diarist , along with more gleeful anecdotes from her teenage years. Who else but a 19 year old Carrie would have the balls to take the piss out of Harrison Ford? She then dared to publish the details of their on-set affair some forty years later. His one word response? ""Lawyer"".

[embedded content]

She was just as fearless when it came to defending her appearance. In an interview to promote The Force Awakens , (with her faithful sidekick Gary), Fisher famously shut down GMA presenter Amy Robach who asked about her weight loss with ""That's a stupid conversation."" Fisher also blasted Hollywood's ageism towards women, saying ""Youth and beauty are not accomplishments, they're the temporary happy by-products of time and/or DNA. Don't hold your breath for either.""

That Carrie Fisher is dead at 60 still feels unreal. For her mother, Debbie Reynolds, to die the next day is a cruel twist of fate that belongs in a movie, not real life. My heart aches for Billie Lourd, Carrie's only daughter, who has lost both her matriarchs in one fell blow.

Carrie Fisher's unique voice will live on in her novels, memoirs, and the forthcoming HBO movie Bright Lights , which documents her relationship with Debbie. As for General Leia, there is still her appearance in Star Wars Episode VIII to come. No doubt she will continue to feature in the franchise as some sort of CGI ghost, smiling alongside Yoda (I hope she photo-bombs Han Solo).

""Can we hear it Mummy?"" asks my daughter, as she plays with our interactive R2-D2. The little light comes on and we listen to that famous message one more time. ""Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi - you're my only hope"".

Farewell Princess Leia. May the force be with you. Always.

2431735972,"The DP 103 list of most influential people is out for 2016 - and apparently this year marks the end of the tradition.

The list has certainly had a good run, and I've had some fun writing about those who've sizzled - and fizzled - over the years.

No. 1 on my sizzle list this year - and on the DP 103 too - is Newport Beach activist and Line in the Sand founder Jean Watt.

Watt was on fire this year. At age 90 she inspired and mobilized her grassroots movement to gather more than 13,000 signatures in just two weeks, bringing the planned Museum House project closer to a vote of the people in a referendum.

Watt knocks out City Council member and former Newport mayor Diane Dixon for the top DP spot this year, as Dixon moves down to No. 15.

Dixon was No. 1 in 2015 with her meteoric rise to mayor pro tem - and then mayor this year - after being elected in 2014.

But she fizzled in my book in 2016 as she claimed to be studying every issue and listening to all sides, yet remained tone deaf to the public's political landscape regarding the unofficial dog park, fellow council member Scott Peotter's various rants and the Museum House condominium tower.

Ranked 12th on the list is my favorite ""frenemy,"" political consultant Dave Ellis.

A regular on the list for many years, Ellis was No. 100 in 2013, 61 in 2014 and 78 in 2015.

Ellis certainly sizzled this year, proving that as far as the political influence game goes in Newport, he's top dog. He actually rated higher than most of the City Council members he helped get elected, with the exception of Mayor Kevin Muldoon, who is No. 4.

And I feel Muldoon wouldn't have ranked above Ellis this year if he hadn't been anointed the new mayor by his ""Team Newport"" cohorts on the council. Muldoon held spot 30 on the 2015 list and 36 in 2014.

Faced with the possible referendum on the Museum House project, being mayor in 2017 is pretty much a sucker's bet, as they say in Vegas. Was he smart to accept this position?

If Muldoon votes to move ahead with sending the 1,100-page petition document mandated by the council to each of the 53,131 Newport voters, the cost could bring the price tag of the election to upward of $2 million.

And if he suggests deleting the document pages, his fellow Team Newport members may not agree, which could make him appear politically impotent.

My guess is voters won't forget this whole referendum debacle with Team Newport, but as mayor, Muldoon will be the face of this mess, regardless of how it plays out.

Team Newport could go from being the heroes of the 2014 election to the zeros of 2018 when they are up for reelection.

Another person Newport residents won't soon forget is 26th on the list this year - Councilman ""Two Ton Eddie"" Selich.

I jokingly call him this since it was Selich's idea that the council include the 1,100 pages of background documents for the Museum House project on all the petitions for a referendum - resulting in the signature drive producing nearly 2 tons of paper.

Selich, who is now termed out of the council, has said of Museum House that ""one more high-rise will not change the look and feel of Newport Center.""

So was this a spiteful act aimed at the public, with the outcome poorly calculated by Selich and Team Newport?

Or was it an ingenious way for Selich - who's not a member of Team Newport - to jam up Team Newport after he left office, since they would inherit this public relations nightmare?

Moving my attention to movers and shakers in Costa Mesa, the DP 103 list certainly reflects the wind of change in that city.

Costa Mesa residents flipped the ideology of their City Council majority with the reelection of Councilwoman Sandy Genis, who came in at No. 8, and the election of newcomer John Stephens, No. 16.

Costa Mesa's newest mayor, Katrina Foley, hits No. 3 on the list. She ranked seventh in 2015 and No. 1 in 2014.

This is Foley's first crack at mayor, and she's already making some important changes that the council is scheduled to vote on at its next meeting.

Tom Hatch would lose the title of chief executive officer of Costa Mesa and rightfully return to the title of city manager.

All public comments at council meetings would be heard at the beginning of each meeting, and council members' comments will be heard at the end.

The mayor's office, previously a ""private space,"" Foley says, will now be the Office of the City Council, where members can meet with the public.

Though these changes are mostly ceremonial, they do send a message that there's a new sheriff in town, so to speak, and things will be different under her watch.

I could go on and on about this final DP 103 list, but it's time to put it to bed and ring in 2017 with all its amazing possibilities, and I predict there will be many.

Happy new year!

Wow, I think the picture has already inspired you and me, so maybe I don't need to write something inspired haha. If you don't know who he really is, I tell you a bit about him. 
He is Elon Musk, one of the world's most powerful people. Since his vision is to change the world and humanity, he is a (co)founders of 5 most innovative company: SpaceX (an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport service company), Tesla Motor (an American automaker and energy storage company), OpenAl (a nonprofit AI research company), Zip2 (a company provides and licenses online city guide software to newspapers), and PayPal (an American company operating a worldwide online payments system.) He is also famous for reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the ""risk of human extinction"" by ""making life multi-planetary"" by setting up a human colony on Mars. He believes in future and make others believe in it."

This past year, sci-fi ruled movies and TV. From the successes of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" and HBO's ""Westworld"" to the highly anticipated Star Wars spinoff ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" audiences can't get enough of the mind-bending genre.

Although 2016 was an especially good time in the life of science fiction, some of the genre's more disappointing past flops are harder to forget. PrettyFamous, an entertainment data site by Graphiq, found the 100 worst sci-fi movies of all time.

To determine this ranking, PrettyFamous considered science fiction movies with over 10,000 IMDb votes and ordered them according to their Smart Rating. This is a score out of 100 that takes into account a movie's IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes' Tomatometer and Audience Score, Gracenote rating, Metacritic Metascore and its inflation-adjusted U.S. box office gross. In the case of a tie, the movie with the lower inflation-adjusted U.S. box office gross was considered worse.

2431739457,"This is the first of three posts on this New Year's Day, building toward a change in (my part of) this space for the next few months.

First installment: quick updates on a few places and projects that my wife Deb and I have learned about in our American Futures travels these past few years.Pittsburgh, Pa. The wonderful City of Asylum community, which Deb wrote about online here and which I described briefly in my cover story in March, has just won a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Congratulations! It's an important and much-deserved recognition.

. San Bernardino, Ca. Long before it was featured in global news because of the terror-related mass shooting a year ago, San Bernardino had struggled with one economic and political blow after another, as we reported here and here. The most dramatic downward step happened in the 1990s, when the enormous Norton Air Force Base, dominant employer when I was growing up in the area and long a bulwark of the regional economy, was closed for good.

This past month the San Bernardino Sun reported on a study showing that all the job loss from that closure has finally been recovered, and that the shift - largely to logistics operations for the likes of Amazon, the Stater Brothers grocery chain, and Kohl's - has on a spending-power basis offset the loss of the base. The former Norton property is now San Bernardino International airport, SBD, which has itself become a major employer. I wrote about SBD several times, for instance here, when our propeller airplane was based at its Luxivair facility during our 2015 California travels; we're headed there again soon. Through this past shopping-and-shipping season the San Bernardino airport won a major new UPS contract. The city of San Bernardino is now looking toward its post-civic-bankruptcy future, as Ryan Hagen of the Sun describes here. Good luck to a town that deserves much more of it.

Fresno and Clovis, Ca. I've talked about Fresno's economic, cultural, technological, and downtown renovations in an endless series of posts; Deb has described schools there and in neighboring Clovis. Here's a report on a big new environmental victory for Clovis; here's a time-lapse video cam of the ambitious reconstruction work underway on Fresno's downtown Fulton Street Mall; here are a few of the ever-expanding civic and tech activities of the training and incubator company Bitwise (including, topically for now, a seminar on how to avoid conflict and actually persuade in an era of polarized views); and here is the latest brewpub to announce its opening in Fresno's reviving downtown. Happy New Year to all.

. Eastport, Me. This fall the Boston Globe had a report on some of the plans, achievements, and frustrations we've been describing over the years in the little Down East city of Eastport, Maine. Now the Christian Science Monitor adds to the discussion of how climate shifts are affecting life in this part of the world.

. Louisville, Ky. Back in June I reported on the exciting FirstBuild maker / prototyping / incubator facility in Louisville. Had the campaign (and China) not consumed so much of my life in the following months, I would have already said more about the stream of new products continuing to come onto the market from FirstBuild. During my visit I was intrigued by its Prisma cold-brew coffee maker, then still in early prototyping. The whole idea of the FirstBuild operation is to enable more Americans to make (and then sell) technically innovative, commercially viable, manufactured products. You can read about a range of the offerings, most based on crowdsourced pre-orders and funding, on FirstBuild's blog and their Facebook page. I've got a dozen more items on the update list, but these will have to do for now. There's a lot happening inside the country. Happy New Year to everyone busily making America greater.

2431756336,"JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION, on the first day of 2017, a look at America.

On this New Year's Day, we'll explore the challenges facing our divided country and what can be done to forge more unity in 2017.

First, a book panel with Isabel Wilkerson, who wrote ""The Warmth of Other Suns."" JD Vance, author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" actor Diane Guerrero, author of ""In the Country We Love,"" and Amani Al- Khatahthbeh, who wrote ""Muslim Girl: A Coming of Age.""

Then, a panel discussion with journalist Michele Norris of The Race Card Project; Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of ""The Atlantic,"" ""Washington Post"" columnist Michael Gerson; and ""Atlantic"" columnist, David Frum.

It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION.

JOHN DICKERSON: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. I'm John Dickerson. Happy New Year. We begin 2017 with a look ahead to what's in store for our nation. We've gathered four authors who've written about the many faces of America, about the differences that divide us, as well as the common experiences that can unite us as one. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson is the author of ""The Warmth of Other Suns,"" a history of the great migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial North in the 20th century. J.D. Vance has written ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a memoir of his upbringing in the rust belt heartland, the part of the country that proved crucial to Donald Trump's electoral victory. Diane Guerrero is the author of ""In the Country We Love,"" a memoir of her experience as the child of undocumented immigrants who were deported when she was a teenager. She's an actor. You might recognize her from the Netflix series ""Orange Is The New Black"" and has served President Obama as an ambassador for citizenship and naturalization. And Amani Al-Khatahtbeh is the author of ""Muslim Girl,"" a coming of age about life as a Muslim woman in the aftermath of 9/11. She's also the creator of the MuslimGirl.com website that showcases the writing of her fellow Muslim millennials. Thank you all for being here to your parts of the American experience. J.D., I'm going to start with you. You call yourself a hillbilly. What is a hillbilly?

J.D. VANCE: Well, I think it's somebody with some attachment to the broad region of Appalachia, whether they grew up there like my grandparents or sort of are the descendants of people who migrated from there. And of course it's a pejorative in some ways if it's used by people on the outside, but as Mamaw, as I called my grandma, always said, ""If it's used by people inside the family then it's okay.""

JOHN DICKERSON: Diane, you say-- you write in your book, ""Deported. Long before I full- fully understood what that word meant, I'd learned to dread it.""

DIANE GUERRERO: Yeah. It was a topic of conversation in my household-- every day. And-- since I was a kid. I mean my parents didn't shield me from it at all-- because I had to be prepared and aware of-- the possibility of them being deported one day. And so I live-- I lived my life that way.

JOHN DICKERSON: And Amani, you write that-- ""After nine--"" you were nine years old-- after 9/11 -- And it was obviously traumatic for the nation. But what was it like for your family?

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: Well-- I mean that year was the same year that I heard my first racial slur. So-- it was definitely a very huge turning point. For my family, our house got t.p.'d and egged. The flea market where my dad worked launched a petition to kick all of the Muslim vendors out -- And it ended up resulting in my family and I moving to Jordan for a short period of time. And I discovered in writing the book that my dad did so to shield us from Islamophobia.

JOHN DICKERSON: And Isabel, let me ask you. You write about the great migration. So much that was changed in America as a result of that. Everything from jazz to the blues to the way the neighborhoods are designed-- This line really stood out to me, though. ""And more than that, it was the first big step the nation's servant class ever took without asking."" How does that start? How did this millions of people moving, why did it start?

ISABEL WILKERSON: Well, I think that, first of all-- any migration is not really about migration. It's about freedom and how far people are willing to go to achieve it, which is what binds all of us together as Americans if you think about it. But this-- this great migration that I've written about gives you a window into a caste system that existed in the South and actually has-- radiates also throughout our culture and even into the North. And in that world it was actually against the law for a black person and a white person to merely play-- play checkers together. You could go to jail. It was-- it was against the law for-- for-- for-- African Americans to pass a white motorist on the road. These are examples of the arcane nature of the caste system that we live with even to this day in many respects.

JOHN DICKERSON: Amani, let me ask you. You-- you moved away because of-- Islamophobia. And then the family came back. Why?

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: My family ended up coming back because my mom became ill while we were in Jordan. So we wanted to reunite the family here. But-- I-- I think that that experience really opened my eyes to the stark contrast between reality in the Middle East, how things were on the ground, as compared to how they are being misrepresented in Western media. And upon my return, that was kind of my personal goal. Was, ""Oh my god. I have to open people's eyes to this."" You know, ""I have to do something to kind of create change in that way."" And then also when I returned from Jordan I was wearing a headscarf, which was a huge difference for me, because I noticed a -- a major shift in the way that people treated me, the way that my friends regarded me-- and the way that total strangers would behave towards me in public.

JOHN DICKERSON: Diane, when you write about-- growing up in-- a family where you were always under this-- because of-- your parents were undocumented, this kind of sense of fear. That word ""deported"" always hanging over. What did the American Dream look like from inside of that-- growing up period?

DIANE GUERRERO: A path for citizenship. Immigration reform. I always hoped that my parents could-- could find that-- so that we could stay together. And I always hoped that we wouldn't be separated.

JOHN DICKERSON: the American Dream was basically just citizen-- citizenship. I mean it's--

DIANE GUERRERO: It was just-- yeah, it was-- the -- it was very simple. It was just staying together. Sometimes it's as basic as that.

JOHN DICKERSON: J.D., you say-- in the introduction of the book you write that, ""Those of us lucky enough to live the American Dream, the demons of life that we left behind continued to chase us."" What does that mean?

J.D. VANCE: Well, for me it means that you don't just all of a sudden get maybe money or a nice credential and all of a sudden everything that you learned, every habit you acquired, every familiar relationship that you had just sort of goes away, because both the people that upward mobility brings you in contact with, whether it's professors or new social circle-- circles, but also the people who you moved away from in some ways, they continue to pull and push in different ways. And so you always feel in some ways, I think, like you've left people that you love the most behind, but also that you're not totally an insider in this new place that you've joined.

JOHN DICKERSON: Your history is always attached to you?

J.D. VANCE: Yeah. Absolutely. And you want it to be attached to you. That's the-- that's the-- the contradiction. Right? Is you don't want to leave that behind, but you also recognize that that history makes you a little bit different to some of the people that you're coming in contact with.

JOHN DICKERSON: Isabel, does that sound familiar to the-- the thousands of people that you interviewed? That feeling of having a history in one place but being, as you said, desperately anxious to get away from that place?

ISABEL WILKERSON: Absolutely. When these people left they went along beautifully predictable streams of migration, which is what immigrants do throughout the world. They-- often-- they had to plot-- plan and strategize in order to leave. It was also awfully, difficult and dangerous for them to leave the Jim Crow South, because there were efforts to keep them there because they served as the-- the backbone of the economy. And they often were faced with-- with violence and arrest if they sought to-- you know, to board some of those northbound trains. So they were-- when they left they-- they-- had to experience great dislocation and then try to find and make a way for themselves in these alien, you know, big cities of the North and the Midwest and West. And many of them carried the same -- their culture with them.

JOHN DICKERSON: I was struck when you talked about the American Dream. You said, ""by their actions they did not dream the American Dream. They willed it into being by a definition of their own choosing."" This idea that the American Dream is not something you-- sort of are on your drive to, but something you have to make yourself.

ISABEL WILKERSON: That is a critical-- part of the-- line in the book, because this is the only group of Americans that had to act like immigrants in order to be recognized as citizens. And their dreams and their goals and-- and what they were leaving for and what they were hoping for is the same thing that any American that's ever lived on this soil has wanted. And I think that the goal that we are facing right now is to see our d humanity. And, you know, we talk a lot about diversity, but I think we should talk more about commonality. I think we're very aware of the things that make us different. I don't think we realize enough what makes us the same and what makes us-- our hearts beat the same and the things that we want are so similar.

DIANE GUERRERO: I'm going to give you a snap for that.

ISABEL WILKERSON: Thank you.

DIANE GUERRERO: Love that.

ISABEL WILKERSON: Thank you.

DIANE GUERRERO: I love that. Thank you.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let's see if we can put together a collection of things that we would say make us all similar across these different experiences.

DIANE GUERRERO: Well, I think we all want to be happy. And I think that-- you know, I-- I don't think we should look at equality as oppression. I think that's what we're-- we're all struggling for. It-- is-- is to be equal. To be recognized as-- as-- that-- that we're all in this place together and in-- and-- and going through the same things. I love my family.

JOHN DICKERSON: Right.

DIANE GUERRERO: That's one thing.

JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, yeah. Family. J.D., you-- families-- you write a lot about family, although it's some-- some incredible family ties, such strength that-- and bonds and rules and code. And you talked about hillbilly justice. And yet, on the other hand-- conflict within family.

J.D. VANCE: Yeah, absolutely. And what I-- I think of-- that really ties us together is something aspirational about being an American. Right? So whether you're a black American moving from the rural South or from South America or from an Islamic country, like, whether it's our parents, our grandparents or even further back, it's this idea that we want something better for our kids than we have right now. And there's this sense, I think, that's built into that whole idea of the pursuit of happiness. Right? That we're going to keep getting better. Things are going to keep on improving. And I think, frankly, a lot of the problems we have in our politics are in some ways rooted in different groups thinking that things aren't continuing to get better. I think that pessimism, that cynicism, is a real problem in our politics and our society more broadly.

JOHN DICKERSON: Is-- do-- is that something everybody signs up to, the idea that things can get better? Or-- because there is some skepticism among some group-- groups in America that the idea of hope and the next generation's going to be better is a dream and an idea that only a certain class or a certain kind of America can have.

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: As long as we continue to give space to voices that are under-represented or might be marginalized in these conversations, especially conversations that focus on them in which they were usually neglected from-- I think that that will allow us to really just make those commonalities more apparent. I'm so curious to know whether you grew up with-- any Muslim friends? Right? Because there have been so many polls that a majority of Americans have never met a Muslim person or haven't had a Muslim friend before. A lot of them from the greater Appalachian region. A lot of them who voted in the next president on policies that he's been, you know, parading around about the Muslim community. So it's, like, you know, for a lot of people, we-- we just aren't able to humanize each other.

J.D. VANCE: Yeah, that's-- I-- I think it's a really important point. And to answer your question, the answer is no, not until I went to college did I actually meet-- a Muslim American. And to your point, part of it is just because we were so regionally isolated. Right? There were basically three groups of people that I saw growing up. The people who were like me, the middle class white people, and maybe the working class black people who lived in my city. And that was pretty much it. And, you know, there's a lot of evidence that when people actually spend time around people who are different from them, a lot of these biases and a lot of this-- this-- frustration sort of fades away. And that's a problem with the fact that we're so isolated right now.

DIANE GUERRERO: And then there's this fear of losing something. That-- you know, instead of seeing this as an opportunity to gain so much. By uniting, by-- by seeing that if we all sort of, you know, kind of lived in a more balanced world that it would be better for all of us. And-- and-- and that no one's here to take anything away from you.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to pause right there. We're going to take a short break. We'll be back in a minute with our panel.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel of authors. Amani, I want to talk to you about this notion of stories there is this balance between, ""How much of the old do I hold onto and how much of the new do I embrace?"" Is there any of that in your experience -- where you looked at your own-- family and thought-- ""Gee, they need to-- assimilate a little more.""

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: I don't think that I have ever looked at my family from a place of they-- they need to change, but of course growing up immediately after 9/11 and through the height of Islamophobia it did cause a lot of discomfort for me as a child. I remember-- that summer, right? I was nine years old. Like, right after 9/11 happened. And-- my dad, he had a store on the Jersey Shore, so we decided to go to the water park one day. And my aunt, who was-- a Muslim woman visiting from Jordan for the first time, she was visiting the United States, she decided to come with me. And she comes onto the tallest water rafting slide in the entire park, fully clothed in her Islamic outfit, you know, from head to toe, covered. All of the families, of course predominantly white, were just, like, staring at us in, like, sheer confusion and possibly horror. Like, ""What is going on here?"" And I just remember in that moment wanting to disappear. Like, I could not wait to rush down the slide and then run off to the boardwalk and then go to my dad and tell him, ""Oh my god. Do you understand what my aunt just put me through?"" You know? But when I told my dad he looked back at me and he said, ""Wow, that was-- that was pretty cool of her, wasn't it? That took a lot of strength. That took-- that took a lot of guts.""

JOHN DICKERSON: J.D., you would talk about being-- feeling like a tourist at Yale. But then now when you go home you feel like an outsider. So you-- you're caught between.

J.D. VANCE: Yeah, I-- you know, sometimes I feel like an outsider at home. Sometimes I probably feel more at home there than I will at Yale. I remember when I went home-- and it was actually the first time that I'd introduced my now-wife but then-girlfriend to my family. We were at a gas station in Middletown and I had on a Yale t-shirt. And a woman at the pump next to mine said, ""Oh, did you go the Yale? My nephew goes there too,"" or my son or something. And I-- and I go-- I, like, had this really intense moment of cultural conflict in my mind. And I'm thinking, ""Well, if I fess up to being a Yalie, then she'll, like, think I'm an outsider. She'll sort of-- you know, maybe she'll-- if she's from the Yale side of the divide she'll judge me and say, 'Oh, look at this simpleton from Middletown, Ohio.'"" But of course that was stupid, because I was in Middletown, Ohio. So I looked at her and I said, ""No, but my girlfriend does."" And then I got in my car and drove away, because I didn't want to admit to having gone to an Ivy League school back home.

DIANE GUERRERO: Well, if I had gone to Yale I'd say I'd gone to Yale.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Well, you can say for the purposes of this show that you went to Yale.

DIANE GUERRERO: I went to Yale!

JOHN DICKERSON: See, now you-- right in main-- the mainstream then. Let me ask you a question about hope, because you-- you write in your book, ""Someone-- once said that hope is the best medicine. In our family and our community, in that attorney's office, hope wasn't just the finest remedy. It was the only one we knew."" You talk about hope, but tell me-- tell the story about that attorney that your father went to to try to get legal status. And what happened.

DIANE GUERRERO: So this lady had given us a card and said, ""Look, this-- this person is helping people with their green cards and-- you know, people who've had worse situations than you guys."" And--so we went to this-- to this attorney. And my-- my dad had-- had high hopes. And he was desperate at this point. And-- we gave him money. He said he could help. And-- he stopped calling. And we went back and-- and his office was gone.

ISABEL WILKERSON: Wow.

DIANE GUERRERO: Everything was gone. And-- and that was a breaking point for my father. And that was sort of-- the beginning of sort of the end of our family unit. And-- and I was there with him. I was there with him every step of the way. And it was-- it was heartbreaking-- because we-- I-- you know, I-- it could have been a lack of education. It could have been hope. I-- it-- it was our last-- it was our last string of hope. And we just held onto it. Maybe this will be the day, maybe this will be the time that-- that things do go well for us."" And-- and it-- and it didn't happen. And-- and so we just sort of-- everything sort of collapsed after that. But my parents always taught me-- to have hope and-- and to dream, and that's-- that's why I think I've made it-- from whatever happened to my family. And I think that's why I'm here, sitting with you here, because I-- I have hold-- held onto that. To that humanity or to my dreams or to that-- that things are going to get better. And if I do try really hard and if I participate and I do my part, then maybe something good can happen.

JOHN DICKERSON: Does that sound familiar, Isabel, to the people who left-- the migration leaving the South? Obviously hope was-- part of it was leaving the--

ISABEL WILKERSON: Yes.

JOHN DICKERSON: --Jim Crow, but part of it was also that hope. And the hope in the things unseen.

ISABEL WILKERSON: Yes. Well, hope and desperation. And a desire to be recognized as citizens in the country that they had helped to build. African Americans, you know, have been on this soil since six-- 1619, longer than many, many people who are currently here. And yet, when they migrated out to what they hoped would be freedom they were met with tremendous hostility and-- resentment. There were-- there's a story out of-- Chicago in which this family-- tried to-- find a home, make a home in-- a place called Cicero. And when they moved in-- it turned out that-- that the people who were living in that neighborhood, rushed the building and they-- tore out the-- all of the fixtures. Threw out the-- the piano. Threw out the-- the sofa. Threw out the-- even the-- the faucet and-- and-- sinks from the walls. And then after they did that, they burned the building-- which meant that even the-- the residents who had been-- who were white were left homeless. This is what happened in the 20th century. I mean this happened within the lifespan of people alive today-- in-- in the 1950s. And that is what they were met with. And we still in this country live with the after-effects of that level of-- of unresolved history, unresolved resentments, unresolved-- and misunderstandings of who we are and what we all want for ourselves.

JOHN DICKERSON: You've all written books, you've-- about trying to get people to understand something that they are not familiar with. That's not an easy thing to do. J.D., when you wrote your book-- what was the reaction to that?

J.D. VANCE: By and large I thought the reaction has been pretty positive. And one of the things I was worried about when I wrote the book, you know, there's this classic hillbilly stereotype, the sort of toothless guy playing the banjo from Deliverance that I really wanted to present a different image of what I thought-- my particular culture represented. And that of course was most embodied by Memaw. And folks have responded pretty positively to her. They tell me that she-- they think she's a hero or that she's a very powerful, funny woman and--

JOHN DICKERSON: This is your grandmother?

J.D. VANCE: That's right. And of course that's how I feel about her. And I'm glad that people have that reaction to her, because I think that she's much more representative of what I saw back home than maybe what the stereotype is.

JOHN DICKERSON: Amani, what has your reaction been to people who can reach out to you through the-- through a MuslimGirl.com and ask questions? And do you find people seeking understanding? What do you-- what's the reaction been?

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: Absolutely. I think that people are always fascinated that my mom doesn't-- chooses not to wear a headscarf, while I do. Or my dad, who is a Muslim father, was very encouraging of me and was the one that, like, pushed me forward my entire life. Things that clash with stereotypes of preconceived notions that they have about how Muslims really are -- but mostly I think that people have been surprised that things are really this bad for us. You know, especially as a Muslim woman, you know, especially for a Muslim woman who chooses to cover, we're one of the most visible religious minorities in the country. And as such, we're literally the lightning rods for a lot of this hateful rhetoric that's happening on a national scale. So for me, you know, my-- my whole goal has been just to show how that hateful rhetoric doesn't happen in a vacuum. It trickles down and it impacts our livelihoods. It results in a real life or death-- crises for a lot of us. And, you know, I think that that's something that a lot of people had difficulty grasping before the-- they read the book.

JOHN DICKERSON: What about you, Diane? Did you-- a similar experience? And what was the reaction to your book?

DIANE GUERRERO: Well, it-- you know, at first I feel it-- it was so surprising to me that people didn't really understand-- because I-- it was-- I-- I feel like-- immigration and-- and immigrants are so embedded in this country's fabric. So for me it was like, ""What do you mean you didn't know?"" I got some hateful stuff, but I think for the-- for the most part, I think people are really supportive and understanding. They don't believe that 11 million people should be deported or families should be separated. And I-- I-- I-- I think there's-- there's a minority who feel that way who fear the growing diversity or-- or feel-- or-- or-- or fear-- maybe a path for citizenship or all these notions of people just rushing this country. And-- but I don't think they understand that what we really want is a path for citizenship for the people who are here and an updated visa system. So these are things that people didn't really understand, but I think that we're starting to have more conversation. And-- and I know-- I know this year has been tough for a lot of people. Everyone's, like, you know, not really happy with 2016. I know it's been a tough year. But-- I think--

AMANI AL-KHATAHTBEH: Good riddance.

DIANE GUERRERO: Yeah, right? Goodbye. But I-- I think it's opened up-- dialogue. And I think that for that we-- we need to be grateful. But-- and-- and now we just, more than ever, need to-- move forward and-- and-- and have these conversations and keep having them.

JOHN DICKERSON: And Isabel, what's the reaction been to your book since you wrote it?

ISABEL WILKERSON: One of the purposes of the work that I did was to reach the human heart. I mean I really believe that that heart is the last frontier. I was actually at-- had a book event in-- on Long Island. And it was a rainy, miserable day, but lots of people had come out. And at the end of it there was a signing line. At the front of the signing line was this-- diminutive grandmotherly figure. And her-- her eyes had already been welling with tears as she stood before me. She said, ""If I-- if I start talking about the book I will cry for sure."" She said, ""I can't talk about the book because the book is my story. You see, I'm an immigrant from Greece, and this book is my story."" And hearing that from her was confirmation to me that the mission of this work was accomplished in some way. Meaning that someone who had a completely different experience could see herself in people that many-- you know, that our culture would say she would have nothing in common with. But that she saw it, she felt it, and she was there standing before me sharing with me that these were the stories of her-- of her own experience.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to Face the Nation. I'm John Dickerson. We continue with our look at America with a group of familiar faces to our Face the Nation viewers. Journalist Michele Norris heads up the Race Card Project and works with the Aspen Institute. Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Michael Gerson is a columnist for the Washington Post. And David Frum is a senior editor at The Atlantic. Jeffrey, I'm going to start with you. I want all of you to take this assignment, but I'm going to start with you because it's-- it's your job, Jeffrey. I want you to--JEFFREY LDBERG: What did I do wrong?

JOHN DICKERSON: Well, in the new year, we want to-- we want to target you with this question, which is: You are an assignment editor. And you have to assign coverage for the year 2017. How do you deploy your forces? What's the story?JEFFREY LDBERG: Well, the story is-- there's one overarchingly huge story. A very big league story, as Michele might say. The-- the-- the story is-- the-- the story is the upending of American politics. The story is of the outs coming in and the ins going out. --The story is trying to explain to the American people what's happened to their two main parties. And-- and the deeper story, also, I don't want to forget this -- the deeper story is globalization, and technological disruption, and anxiety born of-- of rapid change, rapid, destabilizing change, the fragility of institutions. All of that is-- is there undergirding the larger, more immediate story, which is how did Donald Trump become president of the United States and what does it mean for not only the way America understands itself but the way the world understands America. I mean, I would just add one more point, which is that the rest of the world is watching with bated breath. Because we-- we are at a hinge moment in history. Since 1945, we have played a certain role in the world. And it's not entirely clear that after January 20th we're going to play that same role.

JOHN DICKERSON: They should make you an editor. Michele, what's your--

MICHELE NORRIS: Well, I think it's interesting that at the end of the year Merriam Webster-- Webster told us that they chose the word 'surreal' as the word of the year for 2016 because it describes so much of what we're seeing right now. I want to pick up on one of the things that-- that Jeffrey said about the technological disruption. In this country, we've always assumed that technology was a good thing. We embraced it. We assumed that it was propelling us forward and that it would perhaps even though it was displacing jobs, that it would make for a better society, a better flow of information. I think we're going to start to really question that now-- on-- on a lot of levels because of what it's done to democracy, because certainly what it's done to the level of American discourse. And as journalists, you know, we have to learn how to operate in a world where there is no longer a common set of facts. People get their news in such a way that it usually affirms or confirms everything that they already believe. We have someone who is about to occupy the Oval Office who is dismissing many of the publications that we work or have worked for and is trying to bypass us and go directly to people. So as we try to explain this surreal universe, we find ourselves in-- in almost a room of funhouse mirrors trying to figure out how to describe what's going on.

JOHN DICKERSON: David?

DAVID FRUM: A neo-fascist party may win the presidency of France this year. Democratic institutions in the countries liberated in 1989 are falling apart in Hungary, and Poland, and other places -- Croatia, elsewhere. The European Union is cracking apart. And the United States has a new president-to-be who has made it clear he's not going to be bound by traditional rules against corruption, traditional rules against foreign influence, traditional rules in just about any way, traditional rules against the president having his own private bodyguard paid for by himself rather than by the state. We are living through a crisis of democracy not-- unlike anything seen since the second World War. So that's the story. And it's not an American story. It's a global story. It's a story of American non-exceptionalism. And because what is going on in the United States is happening elsewhere, and it's a story about globalization coming home. Because it's-- it's hard -- Americans are used to, as the world's strongest power, being the country that influences others. The idea that a foreign power has reached into the United States, and tampered with American democracy, and maybe chosen for Americans a president that the larger number of Americans didn't want for themselves--

JOHN DICKERSON: Russia in this case.

DAVID FRUM: --that's an experience that other countries, weaker countries, smaller countries have had. Americans, since the great -- since the greatness of this country have arrived, have never had to worry about that. That has happened. So it is going to be a very difficult year, a year that is difficult both because of what's happening and because it's-- it's not in our nature to think about it. One more thing. You know-- I-- I have the experience again and again, and many of you may have it, too, of being in a coffee shop or something. Someone I know a little bit will come up to me, and say hello, and then say, ""Tell me that everything is going to be okay."" And what I realize is, I can't give you the assurance you want. I am not sure that everything is going to be okay. But here's what I do know. The only way that things will be okay is if we all understand how not okay they are. If we are sufficiently inflamed, we may be able to put the fire out.

JOHN DICKERSON: Michael?

MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think there's a pretty much even chance that we're going to have a constitutional crisis or have a completely incompetent presidency that doesn't know how to exercise power, which is, I think, another possibility in this circumstance. He has a White House-- Donald Trump has a White House with almost no skill at governing. He has a chief of staff that's never been in government, which is absolutely extraordinary. He's elevated people, generals and--a corporate heads, that have no experience in this extraordinarily complex business of how you put together an administration, run a bureaucracy, produce ideas. So there's-- I think there's a deep concern about the possibility of overreach. But I think we should be also concerned about the possibility of an entirely ineffective government that doesn't value governing experience, that doesn't value, you know, what government should do and what it can do under the right circumstances.JEFFREY LDBERG: That side of the table is very depressing. (LAUGHTER) I mean, don't you have any hope at all that America is somehow resilient, that the institutions will overcome whatever temporary challenges-- sorry. I just - I just - I'm struck by --

JOHN DICKERSON: But if the idea is that the structures of democracy-- where do you think the--JEFFREY LDBERG: I fully agree with Michele that-- that-- that technology and social media, these-- these pose unique challenges to the way we communicate with each other, the way we organize democracy. But we've been in business for a long time in this country. And-- and - we've survived worse things than whatever we're facing at the moment. I'm just-- you know, keep hope alive. I don't know what the-- the-- feeling is, but--

DAVID FRUM: I am hopeful that Americans will rise to this challenge. I think the message they do not need to hear is, ""Don't worry. Your grandparents rose to the challenge. And therefore you can stay on the couch because you face--""JEFFREY LDBERG: I think you can tell them--

MICHELE NORRIS: I think the--JEFFREY LDBERG: You can tell them that--MICHELE NORRIS: I think the--JEFFREY LDBERG: --there are past examples of bravery, and fortitude, and--

MICHELE NORRIS: The answers is, ""Your grandparents survived this, and you will, too, if you don't stay on the couch--

DAVID FRUM: But you need to take the measure of the-- the threat to democratic institutions in this country and around the world. And I-- I don't think we do people a service by saying, ""You know, there have been bad things in the American past before."" There have been. This is our bad thing, and it's about as bad a thing as has happened in any of our lifetimes.

MICHAEL GERSON: It-- it also concerns me -- we do have this entirely new set of economic and social circumstances. That the normal reaction would be to propose the politics of the future. How do we adjust? How do we compare-- prepare people for the new economy, give them the skills and social capital they need to succeed in an entirely different world? And you look at the message of ""Make America Great Again."" And that is a backward-looking message. That is kind of a return to social patterns and economic, you know, approaches of the past. We can't undo globalization. That's not possible. And then you look at Hillary Clinton in this last election. She had a very backward-looking message as well. It was not, the-- you know, the forward-looking, prepare America for opportunity, you know, address the deepest problems of our country. So we have two parties that in our last political experience are not addressing the future. They're actually talking about nostalgia.

MICHELE NORRIS: Well, and they're not in some ways addressing reality, you know, also. I mean, in the phrase ""Make America Great Again,"" there is one word that if you are a person of color that you sort of over. And it's the word ""again."" Because you're talking about going back to a time that was not very comfortable for people of color. They did not have opportunities. They were relegated to the back of the line. And this is a country that, you know, to be honest, was built on the promise of white prosperity above everything else. And for a lot of people when they hear that message, ""Make America Great Again,"" deeply encoded in that message is a return to a time where white Americans can assume a certain amount of prosperity because--

MICHAEL GERSON: And that's true of gay people. It's true of women who want leadership roles in this society. It's a - It's a fairly-- large, you know, group of people who are not - don't like nostalgia in that sense.

JOHN DICKERSON: Michele, did you-- since the Race Card Project, you've spent a lot of time looking at the conversation about race in all of its different forms in America. Did you - when you saw the racial aspects of this campaign, say, ""That's what I've been hearing,"" and that's been bubbling under the surface for the last four years or six years you've been working on this? Or--

MICHELE NORRIS: More particularly in the last two years. I--I don't want to say that I told you so, but I was not as surprised by Donald Trump's victory because I saw a lot of these sentiments coming in, you know, over the transom. A lot of people feeling a lot of vertigo in this country for a lot of reasons. Some of it is, you know, racial fragility and not necessarily feeling like their feet touch the floor, feeling that they're not at the front of the line. But also technological disruption. Even though the economy, all these indices of the economy, suggest that we're doing fine, people don't necessarily feel it. And Donald Trump was able to tap into a message where people felt a lot of discomfort. And-- and that again is somewhat retrograde. I mean, fear is not our brand, you know, in America. And-- and that is so much sort of the bright vein that ran--

DAVID FRUM: But the reason these --

MICHELE NORRIS: -- through this campaign.

DAVID FRUM: -- things are happening, and not just here but everywhere else, is-- look, we've-- we've had a period of quite slow growth since the year 2000 for most people at the same time as we have had convulsive levels of migration. Migration is one of those policies who-- that has-- we've lost sight of what it's supposed to do. We have it whether we need it. We have it when the economy is good. We have it when the economy is bad. We have it when jobs are-- when jobs are looking for work. We have it when workers are looking for jobs. And it is profoundly destabilizing to people. And look at what-- in Europe it is connected to extraordinary physical insecurity. These levels of violence and disorder that are connected to the immigration. And so it is-- that's also not surprising.

JOHN DICKERSON: Let me take a pause there. We'll be back with more from our panel.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel. David, I want to ask you -- Barack Obama has been saying to Democrats who are nervous about Donald Trump, ""The office constrains the man."" He says the White House will keep Donald Trump from doing all of the things he promised he would do in the campaign. Do you buy that theory of the presidency?

DAVID FRUM: No. Not at all. I'm not sure that Barack Obama would really buy it. I think it's just the sort of thing that an outgoing president says. Especially to a party that feels maybe that outgoing president didn't do all that he could have or should have done to assure his-- the preservation of his own legacy. The power of the-- the presidency is very powerful. It's more powerful than it used to be. And it's especially powerful when it is joined to a Congress of the same party. And a Congress that's full of people who are doubters of Donald Trump but who have made a bargain. That there are things that they want badly to do. They look to this president to sign those things. And he's made it clear the things you in-- the Republicans in Congress care about most he will do. And all he asks in return is that they leave him alone to do the things that he cares about most. So we're going to have an agenda from Congress that is pretty unpopular in all of the country that is able to passed into law only because this unpopular president is there by accident to sign it. So they are dependent on him. They know if he falls, they're doomed. And he meanwhile has a highly individualistic agenda I believe that is focused mostly on self-enrichment and also self-protection against investigation of the extent of foreign involvement in his election.JEFFREY LDBERG: I-- I will attach myself to David's negativity in this case. The presidency is a very powerful office. And what we've seen in the run-up to inauguration is that the man has the power just through his use of Twitter to destabilize among other things the most important bilateral relationship between two countries in-- in the world, the China-US relationship. So his ability to create chaos is--is-- is really quite remarkable. And-- and-- and-- one could say, yes, when you're really frightened, when-- when the intelligence people come in and say, ""You can't do that, or this war is going to break out,"" well, then-- well then a lot of presidents get constrained. But this is a guy so far that won't take intelligence briefings. So that's--

DAVID FRUM: Well --JEFFREY LDBERG: -- problematic.

DAVID FRUM: But China is big and can look after itself. He also has the power to identify, ""Hey, you, union president in small town America, you, everybody on Twitter, hate him and bring him death threats--"" So that power--

JOHN DICKRESON: Yeah.

DAVID FRUM: --has been used once. I don't think (INAUDIBLE)

MICHELE NORRIS: But that's where the bargain may fall apart though. You know, the grand bargain that he has allegedly struck with Republicans. Because I think you may start to hear this phrase, ""Country first."" And if people are really concerned about democracy, it's a moment where people will really have to think about-- what is -JEFFREY LDBERG: But an awful lot of Republicans have bent in his direction though. They have moved in his direction--

JOHN DICKERSON: Michael, would you--

MICHAEL GERSON: And the problem is not just chaotic management theory. It's actually a weird cycle by which people stay on message for seven days. And then all of a sudden, 3:00 in the morning, he reads InfoWars, and, you know, sends off a , and goes off. And then everyone has to go to the family and say, ""Can you get him back on the wagon?"" And then there's another crisis like-- process like this. The presidency can't work that way. You can tank markets. You can invite incursions. You can do a variety of things. And the manner in which he both manages and his lack of control -- impulse control when it comes to his own message, I don't know how that works in the presidency. It's going to be fascinating.

MICHELE NORRIS: Well, he-- the president -- he may not change, but his responsibilities will change. And so you have someone who-- who obviously has a certain amount of impulse control walking into an office that has great physical and mental demands. And it will be really interesting to see how the office perhaps doesn't constrain him in terms of power--

DAVID FRUM: It's interesting --

MICHELE NORRIS: --but just the reality of doing that job, which is a full-time job that you never, ever let go.

DAVID FRUM: Let me give you an example of something we should all be very frightened of. And this may be the single most dangerous thing for world peace that happens. It's very bad when a president, as Barack Obama did, draws a red line and the red line isn't actually there. That's humiliating. That leads people to misunderstand. What is much more dangerous is if the president says the red line isn't there and it really is. Trump is everyday signaling-- signaling that red lines aren't there, that NATO doesn't matter.

JOHN DICKERSON: Meaning that America has withdrawn--

DAVID FRUM: Meaning that--

JOHN DICKERSON: --within its borders.

DAVID FRUM: --But he-- he is wrong about that. That there are--

MICHAEL GERSON: The Baltic states and others.

DAVID FRUM: There's an American armored brigade taking up a position in Poland. There are NATO -- nuclear-capable NATO armies in Estonia-- and-- and there's a nuclear-- there are nuclear-capable NATO powers that are in Estonia, and there are NATO armies in Latvia and Lithuania. There's a big buildup happening in Bulgaria. You give the Russians the idea that the United States is not serious--JEFFREY LDBERG: Look, Saddam had this in Kuwait. Saddam felt that the U.S. was signaling that it would have been okay to invade Kuwait, take it as your own. There were mistaken signals sent. Saddam went, and then there was a reaction. And we all know what the reaction was. So this is-- there is precedent in the presidency for this to-- to happen.

MICHELE NORRIS: You know, John, you asked Jeff as an assignment editor what would he be looking for. Where is he positioning people now? The questions that we're not asking, one of the big questions, I think is-- is in regard to our military, and its capability, and its footprint right now. You know, a much more hawkish administration is going in because of the conflicts that you're talking about, because of the things that we don't fully understand. I mean, one of questions I have is: What is our military footprint going to look like? You hear generals quietly talking about a return of a draft, a return of a draft that might include females. You know, these are big questions that I think need to be considered as we go into 2017.

JOHN DICKERSON: Michael, let me ask you this question about the constraints the Republican Party could put on Donald Trump. Clearly one of the stories of 2016 was that there were no constraints in the primary that a party could put on its nominee. And so Donald Trump-- it is now Donald Trump's party. But in Congress, there are-- Paul Ryan is one example -- David makes the good point that Paul Ryan is getting a lot of what he wanted and is going to try and stick to his lane and not-- and let Donald Trump sort of exist over here. Is that the way you see it in terms of the relationship between Donald Trump and the Republican Congressional leaders?

MICHAEL GERSON: Well, in kind of the Venn diagrams, there's a -- there's a middle in which they both agree, which is undoing executive orders, and, you know, maybe tax reform, or, you know, certainly environmental policy, or other areas. So those things will get done. I mean, he has control. And the Congress will support him in--in those things. But, I-- you know, on-- on items where they do not that agenda, you know, I don't know. The president has a tremendous ability to set the priorities, the national priorities. And the problem here is, you know, I think that he is signaling an agenda, tax cuts, massive infrastructure, defense increases, balanced budget, that are completely inconsistent. There's no budget you could put together that actually includes all the priorities that he's talked about. They don't know how to put together a budget. That's going to be a fascinating initial test of whether he actually has a realistic budget and--

DAVID FRUM: And he has the least competent OMB director in the history of the office.

MICHAEL GERSON: Right. So it'll be interesting whether he can lead on that or where they are just overwhelmed by the reality of governing in a way that may empower the Congressional wing of the party.

JOHN DICKERSON: Michele, do you see in response-- you know, two big forces -- there are often big opposite reaction forces. We saw it in Barack Obama's election, that the birther movement, Donald Trump being the leading proponent of the idea that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Do you see that kind of shock reaction in a way that becomes formalized or-- or that tries to match Donald Trump in the power and success that he had with his tactics?

MICHELE NORRIS: I-- it would probably come from the Democrats. And one of the challenges there is the Democratic Party is very complex. And it is a party of-- it is truly a big tent party. And so it's unclear exactly how that will happen. Right now because the Democratic Party also seems to be doing a little bit of introspection and still-- you know, we're still sort of adjudicating what happened in November of 2016 and not necessarily looking forward to what will happen, I think we're going to see that, though. And I think some of it might actually possibly come not just from the Democrats but from Republicans. Donald Trump made a lot of promises that are going to be very difficult to deliver. And the people that he pumped up at all these-- these rallies during his campaign and now, you know, as he's just completing his victory tour, people have great expectations. And, you know, when you ask people to pick up their pitchforks and march behind you, if you can't deliver, those pitchforks wind up being aimed at you in the end.

DAVID FRUM: There are a lot of things Donald Trump doesn't know. But he does know how to dominate, bully, and provoke. And one of his goals, I think, in 2017 will be to drive people on the left to do self-destructive things that will damage them and empower him.

MICHAEL GERSON: If that works, we will have no center-right party and no center-left party in America. It will be the institutionalization of the extreme polarization --JEFFREY LDBERG: But the enormous assumption David is making is that the Democrats on the left will have the discipline to respond to this--

DAVID FRUM: Well I didn't make that assumption.JEFFREY LDBERG: Well no, no, no --

JOHN DICKERSON: And there is no incentive for the left --JEFFREY LDBERG: But the implicit assumption is-- there's no possibility that this party that has no senior leadership at the moment, that has no plausible candidate to run against Donald Trump in four years. It has a bunch of semi-plausible candidates--

DAVID FRUM: But that party's going to spill out beyond leadership. I mean, yes, there will be the Nancy Pelosis and all of the other aged Democratic office holders. But there will be-- there will be then this frenzy of activity. Occupy Wall Street but for real and purposeful out in the streets. And-- and the question is: Will they do--JEFFREY LDBERG: And that will lead to the crackdown.

DAVID FRUM: --wise things? Or will they do foolish things? Will they march with Mexican flags and burn American flags? Or will they-- or will they say, ""We are here to defend not in an ideological way but to defend American institutions""? And that will be a test of discipline. And I am anxious as to whether people--

MICHELE NORRIS: But defending American institutions--

JOHN DICKERSON: Last word --

MICHELLE NORRIS: I think, you know, when we're talking about protests, you have to remember that people have a right to protest. And sometimes defending American institutions is actually challenging them.

DAVID FRUM: What I mean by defending American institutions is that the president shouldn't have his own private band of bodyguards. He should use the Secret Service. What I mean by defend is the president shouldn't extract bribes. What I mean by defending American institutions is the president should tell the truth. He should release his tax returns. Basic norms of how a democracy with a strong executive and weak checks on corruption, which is unfortunately something that has always been true in the United States. How it polices itself. Those are the things. I don't mean-- I'm not telling anyone to be quiet. I'm telling people to understand the nature of the threat they face. And it's-- it's-- it's not because you're going to have conservative appointees to the Supreme Court. That is not-- if I were a liberal and a Democrat, which I'm not, I-- I would hope I would have the discipline to say, ""You know what? The Republicans, they won the election. They get to have their Supreme Court appointees."" They don't get to have, however, their private presidential bodyguards. That's not okay.

JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to have to end it there. Thanks to all of you for joining us. And a happy 2017 to you, what you've said today notwithstanding. We'll be right back in a moment.

DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks for watching on this New Year's Day 2017. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.

Toczy się tam walka o rynek energii pomiędzy branżą solarną i prosumentami z jednej strony - i koncernami energetycznym z drugiej. Jak na razie górą są koncerny energetyczne. Wynik próby sił, która ma miejsce w Nevadzie, może mieć znaczenie dla rynku fotowoltaicznego w innych stanach USA. 

Cały tekst na gramwzieolone pl 

Rynek fotowoltaiczny w USA przechodzi okres boomu napędzanego przez rządowe ulgi podatkowe czy zachęty wprowadzane w poszczególnych stanach, w których popularność zdobywa zwłaszcza tzw. net-metering pozwalający właścicielom instalacji fotowoltaicznych na sprzedaż nadwyżek niewykorzystanej energii i bilansowanie jej z energią kupowaną z sieci.

Dzięki takiemu mechanizmowi, który stosuje już ponad 40 stanów USA, szybko rozwija się rynek firm instalujących małe systemy fotowoltaiczne. Liderem tego rynku jest firma SolarCity związana z miliarderem, właścicielem Tesli czy SpaceX Elonem Muskiem.

SolarCity wypożycza instalacje solarne właścicielom domów, na których je montuje. Dzięki temu małe firmy i gospodarstwa domowe mogą oszczędzać na rachunkach za energię, a korzyści z takiego rozwiązania potwierdzają liczone już w setkach tysięcy instalacje.

Związana z Elonem Muskiem firma SolarCity rozpoczęła swój biznes od Kalifornii, a następnie rozszerzała go na kolejne stany, w tym na Nevadę, w której właścicielem stanowego operatora energetycznego NV Energy jest inny amerykański miliarder Warren Buffett.

W Nevadzie i w innych stanach, w których wprowadzono net-metering, operatorzy muszą odkupować energię po stawkach ustalanych przez stanowego regulatora - z reguły zbliżonych do stawek, po których zakłady energetyczne same sprzedają energię odbiorcom końcowym.

- W Nevadzie net-metering działał dobrze, tak dobrze, że NV Energy, największy operator w stanie, rzucił do walki z nim wszystkie siły - komentuje Bloomberg.

Najpierw NV Energy skutecznie lobbował za tym, aby ograniczyć całkowitą ilość energii, którą mogli produkować stanowi prosumenci, do 3 proc. całkowitego, szczytowego potencjału firm energetycznych. W ubiegłym miesiącu NV Energy zanotował kolejny sukces w walce z prosumentami. Stanowy regulator wprowadził prawo, które zwiększyło koszty inwestycji w elektrownie słoneczne i sprawiło, że własna produkcja energii stała się nieopłacalna także dla tych, którzy już posiadali instalacje solarne.

- To wszystko rozzłościło niezależnych, wolnorynkowych i świadomych środowiskowo mieszkańców Nevady - komentuje Bloomberg, opisując protesty, które towarzyszą ograniczaniu praw prosumentów w tym stanie. Do protestów przyłączyło się obok prosumentów i osób z firm instalacyjnych, w tym SolarCity, wiele znanych osobistości, m.in. aktor Mark Ruffalo.

Bloomberg zauważa, że podobne działania wymierzone w prosumentów są prowadzone przez amerykańskie koncerny energetyczne także w innych stanach USA, ale nigdzie nie miały takiego efektu jak w Nevadzie.

- Właściciele domów nie mają już żadnych zachęt, aby umieścić na dachach panele fotowoltaiczne, a ci, którzy już je mają, mogą zapłacić dodatkowe 11 tys. dolarów w ciągu następnych dwóch dekad. Będziemy walczyć i jestem pewny, że wygramy - zapewnia Lyndon Rive, CEO SolarCity, prywatnie kuzyn Elona Muska."

2431768878,"Top 10: Así fue la ciencia en 2016

Los expertos llevan tiempo advirtiéndonos de que ciertos factores del mundo de hoy, como el cambio climático o la gran movilidad de personas y mercancías, pueden aumentar el riesgo de epidemias globales hasta ahora desconocidas. Y como haciendo eco de esta advertencia, buena parte de la humanidad apenas se había repuesto de la conmoción causada por el ébola cuando se ha visto obligada a aprender el nombre de otro virus. El zika ha sido sin duda el asunto de carácter científico que más ha interesado y preocupado a la opinión pública mundial durante 2016. Repasamos ésta y otras historias de la ciencia del año que termina.

1. El zika, la nueva amenaza

Acababa de comenzar el año cuando la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) advertía sobre un virus hasta entonces casi desconocido, el zika. Aunque el patógeno se aisló por primera vez en 1947, su presunta benignidad lo mantenía lejos del foco de interés, incluso cuando el brote surgido en Brasil en 2015 comenzó a extenderse. Hasta que los científicos empezaron a sospechar que el aumento en el número de casos de bebés brasileños nacidos con microcefalia, una grave malformación cerebral, se debía probablemente a esta enfermedad transmitida por el mosquito Aedes aegypti. Mientras la epidemia se propagaba a otros países y la OMS declaraba la Emergencia Internacional, los científicos confirmaban el vínculo entre zika y microcefalia. Aunque la OMS declaró el fin de la Emergencia el 18 de noviembre, recomienda mantener una alta vigilancia para lo que considera ""un desafío de salud pública significativo y duradero"". El virus no ha desaparecido, y las vacunas aún tardarán años en llegar.

2. Una sacudida en el espacio-tiempo

Ha sido el mayor descubrimiento científico de 2016, y uno de esos hallazgos que huelen a premio Nobel. El 11 de febrero, los responsables del experimento LIGO en EEUU anunciaban y publicaban la detección de ondas gravitacionales por primera vez en la historia, una sacudida en el tejido del espacio-tiempo producida por la cataclísmica fusión de dos agujeros negros hace 1.300 millones de años. La posibilidad de captar estas distorsiones en la alfombra cósmica, tal como predijo Albert Einstein hace cien años, inaugura una manera totalmente nueva de estudiar el universo que ya ha comenzado a rendir sus frutos: el 15 de junio se anunciaba la segunda detección de otra onda creada por la colisión de otro par de agujeros negros.

3. E. T., más cerca que nunca

Con más de 3.500 mundos ya confirmados fuera de nuestro Sistema Solar, el hallazgo de nuevos exoplanetas ya no provoca el entusiasmo de finales del siglo pasado, cuando se confirmaron los primeros. Hoy se descubren a granel: en mayo de este año, los responsables del telescopio espacial Kepler de la NASA anunciaron de una vez 1.284 nuevos planetas extrasolares. Pero ninguno de ellos ha suscitado tantas expectativas como Proxima Centauri b. En agosto, una colaboración internacional de científicos describía en la revista Nature el exoplaneta habitable más próximo a la Tierra jamás encontrado. A poco más de 4 años luz de distancia, con una masa algo mayor que la terrestre y situado en la zona templada de su estrella, la posibilidad de que contenga agua líquida ha reavivado las especulaciones sobre la vida alienígena. Aún se desconoce si podría albergar océanos y una atmósfera.

4. La vida mínima

El científico y empresario J. Craig Venter quiere pasar a la historia como el primer humano capaz de crear vida sintética. Y aunque para muchos expertos este concepto no puede aplicarse estrictamente a los logros de Venter, puede decirse que ha creado lo más parecido hasta ahora: una bacteria animada por un genoma sintético, el más pequeño en un organismo capaz de replicarse de forma autónoma. Basándose en sus trabajos previos, Venter y sus colaboradores han reducido la dotación genética esencial para la vida de esta célula a sólo 473 genes en 531.000 pares de bases, las ""letras"" del ADN. Una vez fabricado este genoma, lo trasplantaron a una bacteria vacía, logrando que volviese a la vida. El organismo así creado, denominado JCV-syn3.0, se publicó en marzo en la revista Science. Venter continúa tratando de reducir este genoma en el que probablemente aún hay genes prescindibles: 149 de los 473 son de función desconocida.

5. El nuevo Planeta Nueve

El astrónomo Mike Brown es conocido como ""el hombre que mató a Plutón"", algo que exhibe con orgullo incluso en su cuenta de Twitter, @plutokiller. Suyo fue en 2005 el hallazgo del planeta enano Eris; enano, pero mayor que Plutón, lo que llevó a degradar al antiguo noveno planeta. En enero de 2016, Brown compensó su asesinato con el alumbramiento de otro posible Planeta Nueve: en un estudio publicado con su colega Konstantin Batygin, aportaba modelos de simulación que apoyaban la existencia de un gran objeto más allá de Neptuno, de tamaño similar a éste y de diez veces la masa de la Tierra. El Planeta Nueve, también llamado Planeta X, explicaría las órbitas aberrantes de varios objetos transneptunianos, incluyendo algunos descubiertos también este año y que han prestado mayor crédito a la hipótesis. Su detección directa, si el planeta existe, será compleja; pero la carrera de los astrónomos por ser los primeros en lograrlo ya está en marcha.

6. Las mentiras del azúcar y los errores de la grasa

El escándalo científico del año saltó en septiembre, cuando una investigación publicada en la revista JAMA Internal Medicine destapó que durante años la industria azucarera ocultó deliberadamente la incidencia de su producto en el riesgo cardiovascular, culpando en su lugar a las grasas saturadas y al colesterol. Junto a la revelación de esta conspiración, estudios recientes han cuestionado el dogma clásico que vincula grasa y enfermedad coronaria, todo lo cual ha suscitado un enconado debate entre los expertos. Por el momento, las directrices nutricionales oficiales de EEUU han suprimido el límite al colesterol en la dieta, mientras otro estudio publicado en noviembre concluía que el consumo de un huevo al día reduce el riesgo de infarto cerebral sin aumentar el de ataque cardíaco. La polémica promete continuar.

7. Papá, mamá y co-mamá

Reino Unido se ha convertido en el primer país del mundo en legalizar la creación de los llamados embriones de tres padres. Este diciembre, la Autoridad británica de Fertilización Humana y Embriología (HFEA) ha autorizado el ""uso cauto"" en ciertos casos de la donación de mitocondrias, los orgánulos que actúan como generadores de energía de la célula y que poseen su propio ADN externo al núcleo celular. Cuando la madre posee un ADN mitocondrial defectuoso que podría transmitir a su bebé una grave enfermedad congénita, la sustitución de estos genes maternos por los de otra mujer sana evita el riesgo. En la práctica, el procedimiento consiste en extraer el núcleo del óvulo de la madre con las mitocondrias alteradas e inyectarlo en el de una donante sana cuyo ADN nuclear ha sido previamente eliminado. Aunque la técnica ya se ha empleado en otros países aprovechando la falta de regulación, en 2017 nacerán los primeros bebés británicos de tres padres con amparo legal.

8. El anticuerpo que se come el alzhéimer

Cualquier avance prometedor contra el alzhéimer es saludado con grandes titulares, como los que el 1 de septiembre vaticinaban una revolución en el tratamiento contra este azote neurodenegerativo. Según un estudio publicado aquel día en la revista Nature, 165 pacientes en la etapa temprana del alzhéimer habían visto cómo se reducían sus placas cerebrales beta-amiloides, depósitos anormales de proteína que pasan por ser los responsables de la enfermedad. El milagro era obra del aducanumab, un anticuerpo desarrollado por la compañía Biogen que se une a las placas amiloides y consigue su eliminación. Sin embargo, los expertos recomendaron cautela; de hecho, algunos científicos creen que en realidad el beta-amiloide podría no ser la causa del alzhéimer, sino un resultado o un daño colateral. El ensayo clínico en fase 1b publicado en Nature sugería ciertas mejoras cognitivas en los pacientes, pero las conclusiones deberán esperar a los resultados de la fase 3, actualmente en ejecución.

9. Espacio privado

Las empresas privadas han entrado con empuje e ideas nuevas en el espacio, antes coto exclusivo de los estados y sus grandes agencias. El 8 de abril, la compañía SpaceX creada por el fundador de PayPal Elon Musk logró un hito histórico: recuperar sana y salva la primera fase de su cohete Falcon 9 durante una misión orbital, haciéndola aterrizar en una plataforma móvil, un barco. SpaceX ya lo había conseguido antes en tierra firme. Blue Origin, fundada por el creador de Amazon Jeff Bezos, también ha recuperado sus cohetes, en este caso en vuelos suborbitales. Pero Musk no se conforma con esto: su misión en la vida es ""hacer de los humanos una especie multiplanetaria"". En septiembre presentó su más que audaz proyecto del Interplanetary Transport System, una nave para cien personas con la que planea fundar una colonia en Marte en la próxima década. Otros apuntan mucho más lejos: el proyecto Starshot, financiado por el empresario ruso Yuri Milner dentro de su programa Breakthrough Initiatives y presentado en abril junto al físico Stephen Hawking, pretende enviar una flotilla de diminutos veleros espaciales a Alfa Centauri, el sistema estelar más próximo.

10. Europa y Rusia se estrellan en Marte

No se ha logrado romper el maleficio. La primera etapa del proyecto ExoMars, el gran programa de exploración marciana de la Agencia Europea del Espacio (ESA) y Rusia, se ha resuelto con sonrisas y lágrimas. Su fase orbital, el Orbitador de Gases Traza (Trace Gas Orbiter, TGO), se insertó con éxito en la órbita de Marte para estudiar los gases raros de su atmósfera, sobre todo el metano, un posible signo de vida. Pero el módulo Schiaparelli, que debía aterrizar, se estrelló el 19 de octubre en Marte por un fallo de software aún no aclarado. El desastre ha roto la esperanza de Europa y Rusia de acabar con la hegemonía de EEUU en suelo marciano, pero sobre todo ha fracasado a la hora de demostrar la tecnología de aterrizaje que en 2020 tratará de poner un vehículo autónomo o rover en el planeta vecino. Pese a todo, los científicos e ingenieros de ExoMars confían en que de los errores se aprende para no repetirlos y seguir adelante: este diciembre, el Consejo Ministerial de la ESA ha aprobado la financiación de la segunda fase del programa."
2431769170,"It's the train that many thought would never arrive. After almost 100 years of discussion, the 2nd Avenue Subway line in New York City opened on New Year's Day, complete with a corny video and inadequate restrooms.

There were no rats in sight as trains started running at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. This is just Phase I of the project and is an extension of the Q-line that includes stops at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. More than 200,000 New Yorkers are expected to use this extension, which means you will only need to catapult yourself into a sweaty, overcrowded subway car every other morning.

The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, couldn't contain his pride, sharing with his Twitter followers an inspirational video that sounds more like a presidential speech than remarks on the opening of a subway line. If this doesn't have you smashing out """" as you swing around the train pole, nothing will.

""There is nothing that we cannot do in this state when we put our mind to it, and we are not going to take no for an answer,"" Cuomo said, to cheers from the audience. A strong mind, 100 years and $4.5 billion dollars and you can do anything, New York!

In the video, Cuomo makes note of the never-ending struggle to make the 2nd Avenue Subway line a reality. During the last century, the project has been called ""politically impossible,"" ""too ambitious"" and ""technologically challenged,"" which led to the the line being dubbed The Line That Time Forgot.

It's been an on-again-off-again relationship for New Yorkers. The line was originally proposed in 1920, but ground was not broken until 1972. In 1975, due to financial concerns, construction was halted and the project was put to bed. It was revived in 1990 with new plans, but didn't get off the ground until the early 2000s when a multi-phase plan was created. In other words, Phase I has been a long time coming and at this rate, it is likely we will never see Phase III.

As we have learned by now, all good things must come to an end. Within minutes, things went wrong. Despite the slick look of the subway stations and the art beautifying the space, the NYC subway will always be, well, the NYC subway.

I'm on the 2nd Ave subway. It's stopped at Lex-63 station. Conductor says train is ""experiencing some signal problems."" Riders laugh ...

2431776827,"There's Still Time to Support the Mars Society

Dear Friend,
 
I think it's safe to say we live in interesting times with regard to human Mars exploration. I can't remember a period in which the issue of humans-to-Mars has been so front and center, both in terms of significant progress being made with the actual Mars launch infrastructure, engineering and planning, as well as growing public discussion and excitement about the possibility of humans going to the Red Planet. Things are definitely happening, and the Mars Society is pleased to be an active leader in this historic endeavor.
 
We are all aware of the highly-publicized announcement made by Elon Musk about his Red Dragon program that could start sending large payloads to Mars within a few years, and his visionary ideas for colonizing the Red Planet. Elon's vision and leadership have electrified millions of people, not only in the U.S., but around the world, letting our global community see for the first time that humans to Mars is not just a down-the-line dream, but a goal that humanity can reach in the very near term.
 
The development of a substantial heavy lift capability to move equipment, supplies and most importantly large-scale infrastructure to the Martian surface is well underway, with a number of major aerospace companies, including SpaceX (Falcon Heavy), NASA (SLS) and Blue Origin (New Glenn), leading the way. Other space-faring nations are also increasing investment in heavy lift launch technology, all of which will contribute to the store of human knowledge and engineering capacity needed for this venture.
 
From news reporting and film production to academic studies and television advertising, the notion of humans-to-Mars is making serious inroads with the American consciousness. The recent blockbuster film, The Martian, had a major impact on people and provided a realistic cinematic vision of how a human mission to the Red Planet could take place. This has now been followed up by National Geographic's impressive six-part MARS global event series recently broadcast on television and online in many languages around the world.
 
As the largest and most influential space advocacy group dedicated to the human exploration and settlement of the Red Planet, the Mars Society intends to take advantage of this new public interest in Mars by expanding its important work, including: 
Mars surface simulation research and studies in Utah and Canada, including the recently-concluded first half of the Mars 160 mission at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), plans for the second half of the Mars 160 expedition at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) in June 2017 and continuing renovation of our Mars analog facilities.
Expanding our Rover Challenge Series to multiple contests in many countries and from university to high school students.
Public outreach and educational programming, including promotion of STEM studies through many new projects.
With the involvement of our growing Mars Society advocacy network, we look forward to working with the new administration and new Congress in helping shape the future of the U.S. human space program and encourage a dramatic acceleration of the nation's drive for Mars.
 
People are talking about the prospects for a human mission to Mars: not just the usual suspects, but also entrepreneurs and many more who have finally realized that humanity's future in space, beginning with a permanent human presence on Mars, is now within reach.
 
This enthusiasm needs to be organized to produce concrete results. That is why it is so important we continue to build the work of the Mars Society in insisting that the initiation of human exploration of the Red Planet be made a true national goal - not just as a dream for the future, but as an achievement to be accomplished in our time.
 
But we cannot do this without your help. Please join us in the fight for America's goal to send humans to Mars. Support the Mars Society by contributing as generously as possible. I thank you for your continuing support and involvement. Together, we can make it a prosperous new year for Mars!
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Robert Zubrin
President, The Mars Society"
2431780380,"""I'm not saying I'm skeptical of [traveling to] the stars. I just wonder what humanity will even look like when we try to do that.

2431783984,"A concussion that sidelined quarterback Tom Savage could have the biggest impact coming out of the Houston Texans' 24-17 loss at Tennessee on Sunday.

Savage started for the AFC South champions, left in the second quarter to be evaluated for a concussion and was cleared. He took a snap to kneel down on the final play of the first half and was diagnosed with a concussion after being re-evaluated at halftime.

That left Brock Osweiler, benched for Savage last month, running the offense. He threw for 253 yards and a touchdown and also ran for a 1-yard TD on fourth-and-goal in the fourth quarter.

Houston (9-7) will host an AFC wild-card game next weekend, possibly with uncertainty at quarterback.

DaQuan Jones recovered a in the first quarter, and the Titans never trailed to finish with their first winning season since 2011.

The Titans (9-7) also ended a five-game skid to the two-time AFC South champs, who had beaten Tennessee eight of the previous nine games in this series. With their six-win improvement from going 3-13 in 2015, the Titans matched the biggest one-year turnaround in franchise history, previously set in 1967 and 1974.

Matt Cassel also threw for a touchdown in his first start this season in place of an and Derrick Henry ran for a TD. Rishard Matthews caught nine passes for 114 yards, and Pro Bowl lineman Jurrell Casey had two of Tennessee's four sacks.

The Texans had little at stake except sweeping the AFC South for the first time in franchise history. They deactivated six starters before kickoff and had just one starter in on defense by midway through the third quarter. Undrafted rookie Joel Heath had two of the Texans' four sacks.

The Texans had one final chance to tie, getting the ball with 53 seconds left. Osweiler was sacked and threw incomplete on fourth down as Tennessee held on.

MISSING IN ACTION

The Texans scratched six starters, with running back Lamar Miller missing his second straight game. Fullback Jay Prosch also was deactivated. On defense, defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, linebackers John Simon and Brian Cushing and cornerback Johnathan Joseph also did not dress. That didn't stop Houston coach Bill O'Brien for going for it on fourth down six times and trying an onside kick in the third quarter that Tennessee recovered.

ATOP AFC

DeMarco Murray came into the regular-season finale trailing Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell by two yards for the most yards rushing in the AFC. Pittsburgh rested Bell for the playoffs. Murray struggled to find running room against Houston, which has allowed an NFL-stingiest 68 yards rushing per game since Week 8. Murray finished with 21 yards on 11 for his worst performance this season.

UP NEXT

Texans: Hosting an AFC wild-card game against either Kansas City or Oakland.

Titans: A busy offseason featuring two first-round draft picks and lots of salary cap space to accelerate rebuilding.

2431786492,"Los grandes avances científicos que llegarán en 2017
Noticias MVS01 Jan. 14:17

Si los pronósticos astronómicos son acertados, 2017 nos ofrecerá lo que ha sido catalogado como ""el eclipse del siglo"".

En agosto, aficionados a las estrellas de todo el mundo tendrán la mirada puesta en Estados Unidos para este espectacular evento cósmico.

La anticipación es entendible: se trata del primer eclipse total de sol que se verá en territorio estadounidense desde 1949 y, lo que es aún más especial, el primer eclipse de costa a costa, desde el Océano Pacífico al Atlántico, desde 1918.

A lo largo de una hora y media el 21 de agosto, la sombra de la Luna trazará un arco desde Oregón, en el oeste del país, diagonalmente hacia el sureste, hasta Carolina del Sur.

Y varias grandes ciudades, como San Luis en Misuri o Nashville, Tennessee, quedarán en el camino del eclipse.

No hay mucho más que la ciencia pueda avanzar en materia de eclipses, pero éste seguro aportará uno de los grandes espectáculos de la naturaleza de los que vayamos a tener memoria.

El señor de los anillos

En 2017, una de las misiones más exitosas de la NASA alcanzará su dramático final. La sonda Cassini-Huygens fue lanzada en 1997 y entró en la órbita de Saturno en 2004.

La lista de descubrimientos y detalles recogidos por la misión es asombrosa: desde los huracanes gigantes en los polos del planeta de los anillos a los géiseres en erupción en la helada luna Encélado o las lluvias, ríos y mares en el mayor satélite del planeta, Titán.

Pero habrá más: durante 2017, Cassini llevará a cabo más de 20 incursiones en el cordón exterior del imponente sistema de anillos que rodea Saturno.

Esto dará a los científicos una oportunidad sin precedentes para estudiar en detalle los anillos.

""Tenemos dos instrumentos que pueden tomar muestras de partículas y gases a medida que cruzamos el plano de los anillos, así que en cierta medida Cassini también está 'pastando' sobre ellos"", indicó Linda Spilker, científica del proyecto.

Los expertos también podrán observar el conjunto de pequeñas lunas que orbitan en o cerca de los bordes de los anillos.

En abril, Cassini comenzará inmersiones repetidas a través de la estrecha brecha que existe entre Saturno y sus anillos.

Finalmente, el 15 de septiembre, la sonda pondrá fin a su misión al sumergirse en la atmósfera de Saturno: una ""muerte"" diseñada para evitar que se estrelle contra lunas potencialmente habitables y las contamine con cualquier organismo de la Tierra que haya podido colarse a bordo al inicio de su viaje cósmico.

Rápido y furioso

El proyecto Bloodhound tiene una primera misión, la de romper la marca actual de velocidad en tierra de 1.228 km/h con un auto que tiene un cohete entre sus sistemas de propulsión.

El proyecto, de origen británico, ya ha sufrido varios retrasos, pero el equipo responsable confía en que el 2017 será su año de suerte.

La mayor parte de la estructura del vehículo ya está lista y, más recientemente, el equipo ha puesto a prueba el sistema de abastecimiento de combustible.

Impulsado por un cohete atornillado a un motor a reacción de un avión de combate Eurofighter-Typhoon, el auto debe ser sometido a pruebas en el aeropuerto de Newquay, en Reino Unido, en julio. Y luego en Hakskeen Pan, Sudáfrica, durante la segunda mitad del año.

El objetivo es acelerarlo hasta los 1.287 km/h (800 millas por hora) para reescribir el récord de velocidad antes de que el año culmine.

Luego, después de una pausa, el carro debería regresar a Sudáfrica en 2018 para alcanzar su misión última: romper la marca de las mil millas por hora (1.600 km/h).

Heavy metal

¿Será éste el año en que SpaceX, del empresario tecnológico Elon Musk, lance su cohete Falcon Heavy?

El lanzador súper pesado fue mencionado por primera vez en 2005, pero la fecha para su vuelo inaugural ha sido reprogramada varias veces, la última debido a la explosión del cohete más pequeño de SpaceX, el Falcon 9, en septiembre pasado.

Mientras que la compañía de Musk trabaja para hacer funcionar ese cohete en 2017, es posible que veamos también el lanzamiento de su primo más poderoso, el Heavy, durante el año que comienza.

El cohete, que en realidad consta de tres impulsores de Falcon 9 combinados, está diseñado para poner en órbita cargas pesadas, incluidos satélites comerciales y militares y quizá, algún día, una nave espacial tripulada.

Pero los repetidos retrasos han llevado a algunos clientes comerciales de SpaceX a buscar otras alternativas para los lanzamientos de satélites programados en los próximos años.

El lanzamiento de prueba podría hacerse desde la base de la fuerza aérea de Vandenberg, California, o desde el Centro Espacial Kennedy, en Florida.

Hay tanto en juego que SpaceX bien podría posponer nuevamente el lanzamiento. Pero, si tenemos suerte, podríamos ver el espectáculo de la salida al espacio de este monstruo de 70 metros de altura en algún momento de 2017.

2431789892,"It is not uncommon for new development plans in Northern Virginia to raise hackles among residents who want to limit suburban sprawl. But a proposed mosque on a 14-acre plot in a protected zone has sparked heated debate, with allegations of arrogance on one side and of anti-Muslim bias on the other.

The All Dulles Area Muslim ­Society (ADAMS), which has 11 chapters around Northern Virginia and the District, wants to build a 22,400-square-foot mosque on the site in Nokesville, in Prince William County. About 150 to 200 Muslims from the area who conduct Friday prayers in a rented hotel space in Manassas say they want their own place for services, Sunday school, interfaith gatherings and other events.

Opponents say the proposed 500-person facility is not appropriate in the neighborhood of ­single-family homes, which lies within an 80,000-acre swath created in 1998 to preserve Prince William's remaining rural areas from suburbanization.

Known as the Rural Crescent, it serves as a buffer between the county's more developed eastern side and rural Fauquier County to the west. Most residents are required to use septic tanks, lots for new single-family homes must be on acres of at least 10 acres, and the construction of larger facilities, such as religious institutions, requires a special-use permit from the county.

Since buying the site in 2014, ADAMS representatives say they have worked with county officials to address concerns about traffic, lighting and height, and have spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on the plan on top of the $500,000 paid for the land. Their application requests use of the public sewer, which the organization argues is more environmentally sound than a septic tank. Use of a septic tank would likely limit the size of the facility.

Friction has arisen in the past when churches have sought permits for large facilities, with opponents warning they would set a precedent for further development. But in recent years at least two churches have been approved and permitted to connect to the public sewer system. Citing cases around the country where they say mosques have faced more stringent zoning restrictions than other houses of worship, ADAMS says it is being held to a double standard by people who are leery of Muslims.

Opponents of the Nokesville project say they have no problem with Muslims and are concerned only with the integrity of the protected zone and with maintaining a quiet rural lifestyle; many residents keep goats, horses, chickens or cows. A high school was built nearby in 2011, and the county plans to widen a segment of the main road adjacent to the site to alleviate traffic.

The debate boiled over in the fall when ADAMS's application to construct a 45-foot tall building, along with playing fields and a parking lot for more than 300 cars, went before the county Planning Commission.

Impassioned public comment at the Nov. 2 hearing ran for more than four hours, with mosque supporters invoking Plymouth Rock and the First and Fourteenth Amendments and talking about their deep roots in the county and history of public service.

""I just want to say to those who imply that this is not for the residents: We are the residents; we are your neighbors,"" said Shaun ­Ahmad, who lives in Warrenton and added that it was not reasonable to have to drive to the organization's nearest mosque 40 miles away.

Some asserted religious bias was in play.

""Some of the underlying issue, the opposition, could be because of lack of knowledge or hate or bigotry,"" said Rafi Uddin Ahmed, chairman of the civic and public affairs committee of the Muslim Association of Virginia.

""You're afraid of Muslims?"" said Hassan Zahwa of Gainesville. ""There's no reason for that; we have been in this community for years. . . . Turning your head the other way and pretending that we're not here or denying this application is not going to change that fact.""

Opponents countered that their stance was about fairness and had nothing to do with anti-Muslim sentiment. They blasted ADAMS for making the purchase with the assumption that a sewer connection would be approved.

""The applicant paid Rural Crescent prices for land and now want to be allowed to use it as if it were an approved development area,"" said Dennis Hayo, who lives near the site. ""That's a nice increase in investment, but it's not fair to others who purchased in the development area knowing the rules.""

Noting that the site's open space and scenic views were one thing that made it attractive to ADAMS, Tammy Spinks, a neighbor of the site, said that if the project is approved, ""You will be destroying the very thing they sought out, not only for them but for all of us.""

To Betty Morrell, who lives three properties down from the site, it felt like the two sides were talking past each other.

""All we were talking about was land use, and they were talking about what nice people they are, what good people they are,"" she said. ""I think they automatically assume we're talking about race and religion, and we're not."" Morrell is a spokeswoman for Friends of Rural Crescent Energized, a group that formed in opposition to a special-use permit for the project.

That meeting ended with a deferred vote. On Dec. 7, the commission voted 6 to 2 to recommend that the Board of County Supervisors approve the project with a septic tank.

Supervisor Jeanine Lawson (R-Brentsville), whose district includes the proposed site, pointed out that the churches that were granted sewer connections had conditions that posed difficulties in connecting to septic systems.

One site had a major gas pipeline running through the space where a septic system would go; the other was on poor soil that could compromise a septic system. And both already had sewer lines running alongside the properties.

Lawson said ADAMS was ""the only religious institution applicant who has not identified a special exception to warrant the request for sewer.""

To Rizwan Jaka, chair of the board of ADAMS, the concern over sewage is a red herring.

He cited increased anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. ""With over 30 mosques being prevented from being built based off of anti-Muslim bigotry or implicit bias wrapped in land-use arguments, that gives us some concern,"" he said.

In December, the federal Department of Justice sued Culpeper County for discrimination after it denied a request for a permit to build a mosque there. Asked whether ADAMS would push for a similar action in Prince William, Jaka said, ""Obviously we are prepared to advocate for our rights under the law, but we hope and pray that the county and our members will make this a successful situation.""

Scott Christian, a member of the Northern Piedmont Chapter of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, said: ""The fact that it's taken them so long and they have had to go through so many hoops"" compared with churches ""just doesn't seem right. . . . I just wish there was more sentiment to see this as a positive thing and not just look at it as more traffic.""

Acknowledging that there was less explicit bias in this case than in some places around the nation, Jaka said some members of the public had asked questions in early meetings about the treatment of women in Islam and about national security and terrorism.

""I think it's very clear that it is more than just a land-use issue,"" said Syed Murtaza, a member of the ADAMS Gainesville committee, adding that opposition groups, including a political action committee, had formed only after ADAMS bought the site.

ADAMS, which is also facing opposition to a proposed facility in Ashburn, has not said whether it will pursue the project at the Nokesville site if the county does not approve the sewer connection. But Murtaza said, ""If it can't accommodate a certain number [of users] I don't think it will be a financially feasible thing to do.""

- And Helping Drive Climate Change - nearly half of the 32 Indonesian billionaires listed in Forbes magazine have made their fortunes at least in part from palm oil, and that includes 6 of the country's 10 richest. They sit at the top of a very unequal society... much like the US.

The expanding industry is decimating the country's rainforests, fueling a land-grabbing epidemic, desiccating Indonesia's vast peat swamp zones, that fuel disastrous fires yearly, and blanket the region in a choking haze.

OO How Tropical Deforestation, Land-Use Change,

Is Driving Emerging Infectious Disease is highlighted in a recent study of a global pathogen:

250 known human emerging (new/newly increasing) infectious diseases are known many have been traced to tropical rainforests, especially freshwater aquatic systems; one such is the Buruli ulcer [BU] pathogen. When deforestation destroyed a freshwater food web, It destroyed top predators first - allowing lower food chain organisms, hosting the BU pathogen, to increase - the disease then increased in local human populations.

A Single Explosion of a Pathogen Can Spread It as the Zika virus has shown.

Source Center for Disease Control and Prevention

Epilogue:

As deforestation increased further, host organisms decreased; Then both pathogen and human disease decreased.

Even a temporary explosion of a pathogen, however,

can result in its expansion (eg, the Zika virus),

or economically cripple an already struggling developing nation.

Daily Climate Change: Global Map of Unusual Temperatures, Jan 1, 2017

Source cci-reanalyzer.org

How unusual has the weather been? No one event is ""caused"" by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.

Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, much of the US and the waters surrounding it are experiencing warmer than normal temperatures: although Pacific waters off California are now colder than normal, the effects of the warm spot (now centered further south) linger: high levels of toxin in Dungeness crab from the gigantic algal bloom earlier in 2016 limit the season's crab harvest.

Despite recent rains and a wetter winter than last, the drought persists in much of California, and the snowpack, vital to storing water for agriculture, is below normal.

Much of the areas surrounding the North Pole are experiencing much warmer than normal temperatures - not good news for our Arctic thermal shield of ice. Hotter than usual temperatures continue to dominate human habitats.

2431806771,"The Houston Texans are going into the playoffs with their quarterback situation unsettled once again, this time a combination of injury and improved play by Brock Osweiler.

Tom Savage wound up sidelined by a concussion Sunday, and Osweiler played well enough after coming off the bench in Houston's 24-17 loss at Tennessee that coach Bill O'Brien said the Texans will be evaluating who starts their AFC wild-card game.

""We will talk about that as a staff,"" O'Brien said. ""We will talk about that tomorrow and the next day.""

Savage started for the AFC South champions, left in the second quarter to be evaluated for a concussion and was cleared. He took a snap to kneel down on the final play of the first half, and O'Brien told team radio Savage would play in the second half. But Savage was diagnosed with a concussion after being re-evaluated at halftime.

O'Brien said he did not know what happened. The Texans (9-7) will host either Kansas City or Oakland next weekend.

That left Osweiler, benched during a win over Jacksonville on Dec. 18, running the offense. He threw for 253 yards and a touchdown and also ran for a 1-yard TD on fourth-and-goal in the fourth quarter.

Osweiler had one final chance to tie with Houston getting the ball with 53 seconds left. But he was sacked and threw incomplete on fourth down as Tennessee held on.

""He did a good job,"" O'Brien said. ""He competed. Guys got open for him. He threw the ball. Did a nice job for us.""

Osweiler, the quarterback signed away from Denver for $72 million, said he absolutely wants to start in the playoffs.

""You play this game to be a starter,"" Osweiler said. ""You play this game to contribute positively to your team, so I would absolutely love to start this playoff game. But at the end of the day I don't make those decisions.""

Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins said nobody panicked when Savage left the game.

""We hate that Tom went down the way he did,"" Hopkins said. The guy's just getting his chance in this league. But this is the NFL, and it's next man up.""

DaQuan Jones recovered a in the first quarter, and the Titans never trailed to finish with their first winning season since 2011.

The Titans (9-7) also ended a five-game skid to the two-time AFC South champs, who had beaten Tennessee eight of the previous nine games in this series. With their six-win improvement from going 3-13 in 2015, the Titans matched the biggest one-year turnaround in franchise history, previously set in 1967 and 1974.

Matt Cassel also threw for a touchdown in his first start this season in place of an and Derrick Henry ran for a TD.

The Texans had little at stake except sweeping the AFC South for the first time in franchise history. They deactivated six starters before kickoff and had just one starter in on defense by midway through the third quarter. Undrafted rookie Joel Heath had two of the Texans' four sacks.

MISSING IN ACTION

O'Brien said running back Lamar Miller, who missed his second straight game with an injured ankle, should be back for the playoffs. Fullback Jay Prosch also was deactivated. On defense, defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, linebackers John Simon and Brian Cushing and cornerback Johnathan Joseph also did not dress. O'Brien said quarterback Brandon Weeden was the only healthy player deactivated.

ATOP AFC

DeMarco Murray came into the regular-season finale trailing Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell by two yards for the most yards rushing in the AFC. Pittsburgh rested Bell for the playoffs. Murray struggled to find running room against Houston, which has allowed an NFL-stingiest 68 yards rushing per game since Week 8. Murray finished with 21 yards on 11 in his worst performance this season. Murray finished with 1,287 yards and said after the game he finished the season with a torn plantar plate, a ligament on the bottom of his right foot.

QUOTABLE

""Winning is hard to do, and obviously a really good feeling,"" Titans coach Mike Mularkey said. ""But still disappointment as we are not playing. Feel a little bit empty here that we don't have a chance to keep going after today. This is a lesson ... learned.""

UP NEXT

Texans: Figuring out who starts at quarterback.

Titans: A busy offseason featuring two first-round draft picks and lots of salary cap space to accelerate rebuilding.

While you were busy celebrating the holidays, NASA dropped the hottest mixtape of 2016. The Goddard Space Flight Center-where engineers and scientists who work on developing spacecrafts and other NASA technology-dropped a simply fire mixtape to celebrate some of Goddard's greatest achievements of 2016.

Enjoy it these sweet space beats while you can because in 2016, NASA discovered that our planet's 2015 surface temperatures were the highest since 1880, when we began keeping record. Since 2001, every year (except one) broke this record.

If we don't address the looming problem of global warming and the earth becomes uninhabitable, we won't be able to keep making mixtapes. Think about that for a second.

2431813403,"Eleven-year-old Bobby Graves may have only caught the tail end of a century's worth of deferred promises on New York's Second Avenue subway. But he's already seen enough to treat the project with extreme skepticism.

""I thought it was some sort of joke when I heard it was going to open Sunday,"" he said, as he waited with his parents outside the entrance of the 96th Street station.

But it was no joke. At exactly noon on Sunday, Graves and hundreds of other New Yorkers took the inaugural ride on the Second Avenue subway, a trip that whisked them through three brand-new stations that cost $4.5 billion and serve as the transit system's first major expansion project in half of a century.

The new stations are located at 72nd, 86th and 96th streets, and provide an extension of the Q line that will now connect the Upper East Side in Manhattan directly with Brooklyn and Coney Island. There are three more phases planned for the project.

But in addition to the improved transit connections - now, Upper East Side residents can reach Times Square without swapping trains - the debut of the new stations has been hailed for the unconventional design of the stations. They're spacious, airy, with high ceilings, an expansive mezzanine level, and ambitious public art installations.

""I hope when you go down there, you're really going to feel it's worth it,"" said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) outside the 96th Street station on Sunday, thanking the local residents and business owners who endured years of construction work. ""This is a subway system like you've never seen before. It's not your grandfather's subway.""

In the crowd were upper-East-Siders Kaz Tanakh and Mark Conrad, self-described transit diehards who wore New Year's Eve party hats directed with yellow ""Q"" stickers to celebrate the opening of the stations. They took selfies outside of the station's sleek glass entrance.

""A month ago, we thought there was no way this could open on-time,"" Conrad said. ""The streets were just a mess, and traffic was horrendous - it was like L.A.""

There was Lawrence Scheyer, a 61-year-old living in Stuyvesant Town, whose grandfather was a chief designing engineer for the New York subway system and had always hoped to see a subway running along Second Avenue.

""It's an homage to my grandfather's legacy,"" Scheyer said, though he added that he remained disappointed that only three stations were opening, rather than the rest of the planned extension toward East Harlem, which has not yet begun construction. ""It should have been built in one fell swoop.""

At exactly 12 p.m., the crowds followed Cuomo down the escalator and into the station's mezzanine level with clapping, cheering and calls of ""Yeehaw!"" They shot cellphone videos of the mural on the walls and gaped at the high ceilings. Then they packed onto the trains and headed downtown. The speaker system crackled alive. It was Cuomo, speaking into the intercom from one of the rail cas.

""Rest assured, I'm not driving the train!"" Cuomo said over the train intercom as it barreled through the tunnel. He praised the project's managers for completing the first stage of the subway extension on-time and on-budget ""You're on the inaugural ride. It is exciting - a great way to start a new year in New York.""

At 72nd Street, many of those riders disembarked to soak in the design station, where there were already crowds of people seeking an opportunity to get one of the first looks of what was inside. One of those people was 33-year-old Lindsay McLoughlin, who lives a short distance away on the Upper East Side.

""It's like Disneyland for the commuter!"" she gushed to her mother as she stepped off the escalator and onto the platform, grinning and turning in a slow circle.

""I've lived here for eight years in a fifth-floor walkup, which is a challenge in itself,"" McCoughlin elaborated. ""Just to have to walk three fewer blocks to get on the subway - it's like meeting Mickey Mouse for the first time.""

Siblings Micahel and Ellie Mellor, 9 and 7, were equally enraptured.

""It's really cool to be on a new subway!"" Ellie said.

""And being one of the first kids to get in!"" Michael jumped in.

Their father, Jim Mellor, had his own reason to be thrilled about the opening.

""I'm hoping it will alleviate some of the intense crowding on the 6 line,"" he said.

Not everything was perfect for the subway debut, however. One of the first trains scheduled to leave the 72nd Street Station, already filled with riders, held at the station for about 20 minutes as Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials announced that the delay was due to train traffic up ahead.

Thomas F. Prendergast, president of New York City Transit, acknowledged that the wow factor of the new stations' visual design won't mean much if it's not coupled with punctuality and reliability.

""We've gotta follow through with good, on-time service,"" Prendergast said. ""And we will.""

Up on the mezzanine level of the 72nd Street station, crowds gathered along the walls to get a closer at the artwork - a series of dozens of mosaics by the artist Vik Muniz, each of them a portrait of an average New York subway rider. There were kids in soccer gear and a woman in a sari staring at her cell phone. A man holding a bouquet of balloons, and a woman carrying a toddler in one arm and a stroller in the other. A white-collar worker depicted in a clutzy moment of tripping, his briefcase tumbling out of his hands as stacks of papers burst out. Two men, in flannel and jeans and overalls, holding hands. A police officer holding a popsicle.

Riders snapped shots of the mosaics. Some posed next to the artwork. But many just wanted to take a close look, their faces inches away from the wall, their fingers brushing against the tiny glittering tiles.

""What I love was seeing how people responded to it. It's really quite wonderful,"" said Jock McLellan, 76, from Connecticut.

""The art is spectactular - the inclusion, the young and old, black and white, immigrants, readers, travelers,"" said Deborah Daughtry, of Ridgewood, NJ. ""It gave me goosebumps.""

Daughtry came with her partner David Burnett, of Ridgewood, Queens. Neither of them commute frequently to the Upper East Side, but they treated the excursion like a visit to a museum.

""He dragged me out of bed this morning to see it,"" Daughtry said.

Burnett, too, was amazed by his surroundings - but for slightly different reasons.

""I don't know why it needs to be this big,"" he said, chuckling and gesturing at the expansive space. ""These would make great condos. Think about how many studios can fit inside here!""

2431813947,"The 2016 Toyota Mirai.Bryan Logan/Business Insider

Right now, if you want an alternative-fuel vehicle, you have to pick from offerings that either require gasoline or an electrical outlet. The gas-electric hybrid and the battery-powered car - your Toyota Priuses, Chevy Volts, and Teslas - are staples in this space. There are drawbacks for drivers of both types. You still have to buy gas for your hybrid and you have to plug in your Tesla - sometimes under less than favorable conditions - lest you be stranded someplace far away from a suitable plug. Beyond that, automakers have been out to find the next viable energy source. Plug-in vehicles are more or less proven to be the answer, but Toyota and a handful of other carmakers are investigating hydrogen. That's where the Toyota Mirai comes in. It's an ambitious project for Toyota because the fueling infrastructure for this car is minimal. There are only 33 public hydrogen-filling stations in the US, according to the US Department of Energy. Twenty-six of those stations are in California, and there's one each in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. If you include public and private hydrogen stations, then the total climbs to 58 - nationwide. Compare that to the more than 15,100 public electric-charging stations and the 168,000 retail gas stations in the US, and you can see the obvious drawback of hydrogen-powered cars. Despite this, the Mirai is an interesting project, if for no other reason than the fact that it's different. We spent three days with the Mirai in San Francisco.

Here's a despairing email from a ""U.S. Marine who has done multiple tours both in Iraq and Afghanistan since I joined the service in 2006, and I have never been more concerned for my country"":

Fallows recently asked whether Donald Trump was a flagrant liar or can he not tell the difference between what's real and what's not. The scary answer is he doesn't care what's true or not, and more importantly, the only thing that matters is himself and how he feels. This is terrifying, because we now have an emotionally unstable man as president who constantly needs attention and is willing to say or do anything to get the attention he feels he deserves.

The United States has fallen into a state of utter political nihilism, where there is no limit to what one party can say or do in order to achieve and maintain power. Worse, there is no meaning other than political theater behind it. The consequences of this political nihilism will be catastrophic and will reverberate down through the decades of the 21st century. If you doubt this, think of climate change, the global economy, and U.S foreign policy concerning NATO and other strategic alliances. Be afraid, be very afraid!

Another reader absorbs the latest:

After reading the latest cycle on the CIA report reaction ["" Former Acting CIA Director Calls Russian Interference In Election 'The Political Equivalent Of 9/11' ""], I just finally understood a grim truth: President-elect Trump's fear that any hint about election manipulation decreasing his sense of grandeur is greater than his concern about the role and process of elections in general. I say grandeur because he won the election, so his grasp is not tenuous; he is defending prestige alone, and that his pride could outweigh his concern for the engine of democracy is a grim truth indeed.

This next reader draws an analogy to, well, a Grimm tale :

Trump has no loyalties. He only wants to be POTUS because he can't get any richer and see it mean anything. He can't get any more famous. What else is there? He's like the wife in ""The Fisherman and His Wife."" In the end, she wanted to be God.

[embedded content]

Another long-time reader, John, comments on Fallows's latest note -which points out the plain reality that Trump's victory was not the historic landslide he keeps claiming it to be:

I'm willing to bet that Trump knows his Electoral College margin was tiny. I'm willing to bet that he knows that there weren't three million illegitimate voters. I'm willing to bet that he knows Russia was trying to help him. He's not concerned with facts or evidence; he's focused on framing the story for his followers. Fact-checking, shmact-checking-that's something the MSM does and elites care about. Trump is tweeting bald-faced lies to give his followers cover, to give them something they can believe that won't reduce their faith in him.

Trump and his people play by the reality TV rules. All that's required is a plausible facade, while we expect adherence to actual facts. How pathetic are we? All that Trump's followers want is a powerful fiction, something they can sink their teeth into, something with which to taunt us college-educated Atlantic readers. ""Oh, you went to college, and you read all those books and took all those science classes, and you got A's on your report cards? Big whoop, because now all that stuff you learned is meaningless! Facts don't matter. Our man Donald makes it all up as he goes along, and we love him for it."" They love that we get so frustrated by Trump's dissembling. The bigger the lie, the more they love The Donald.

Another reader, Jay, also tackles the ""landslide"" canard-but from the perspective of the popular vote:

Two points occurred to me this week that have not been raised anywhere in media that I have seen:

1. There are many discussion of the popular vote. Clinton's lead over Trump is now 2.7 million votes . And it is often described this way [by New York 's Jonathan Chait]: ""As votes continue to be tabulated in the days since the presidential election, Donald Trump's deficit continues to grow (now at 2.7 million votes , or 2 percent of the total), while the imagined scale of his triumph continues to swell.""

But no one has pointed out that 7.6 million people voted for third parties. So the number of people who did not vote for Trump is now 73.1 million, compared to the 62.8 million who voted for him. So really, Trump lost the popular vote by 10.3 million. The vote was 54 percent against Trump to 46 percent for. I think it is worth pointing that out. It is also a better description of the potential size of the opposition to his policies.

2. I am a business attorney and work with a lot of small- to medium-sized family-owned businesses. Here's a thing that most people may not appreciate: There is no job more like the king of a kingdom in modern society than the CEO of a family-owned business. These businesses often operate without boards of directors. The CEO is often the only shareholder or the majority shareholder. Everyone in the company works for him. These CEOs live in a bubble in which everyone they see does their bidding 24/7/365. Companies have no constitution. There are no internal rules, except those the company wrote for itself. The CEO can change anything any time. ""You're fired"" is certainly important, but only the tip of the iceberg. A CEO can make any plan, start any project, buy any property, simply by deciding to do it all by themselves.

When the press describes Trump as authoritarian, they are correct, but he didn't learn it from dictators. He learned it from his day-to-day work environment, where he had essentially unlimited power over a billion-dollar organization.

The best, fun, family-owned businesses try hard to install some character and moral sense into the heirs that might take over. Many require family members to work outside the company for at least five years, before they let them come to work in the family business. Often those family members do well, are successful on their own, and never come back. But those that do have at least learned how to behave in a outside work environment, where their supervisors have the power to give them instructions, and they have to perform. Trump never had any experience like that, as far as I know. I have certainly seen CEOs in this situations who lack moral character, and the result is not pretty. There is no check on their behavior at all. Typically, the spouse and children who are the only ones who might speak up without getting fired, are too afraid to do it. So the CEO rules like Sun-King in their own little kingdom.

My guess is that Trump thinks that being President will be just like his day job. He can give orders and things will get done. I think he will be surprised by the notion that he is limited by the Constitution, Congress, and the courts. ""I alone can fix it"" is just a reflection of how his world works in the Trump Organization. He has been the only person who gets to make any decisions for more than 30 years. That can certainly warp your sense of self. Mr. Trump's appears to be the worse for the experience.

This next reader wonders if the GOP's muted response to the bombshell news of Russian hacking goes beyond cynical partisanship:

One word that I seem to be missing in the stories about the Russians hacking both the DNC and the RNC is ""blackmail."" If they have incriminating info from the RNC hack, who did they approach to let them know that this information could be released? They clearly could have incriminating documents and emails that the Republicans do not want to get out, and the Republicans seem to have taken great care to prevent the evidence of Russian hacking to be made public. So what do the Russians know and who is most afraid of what they know?

Speaking of Russian intrigue, Fallows forwarded me the following email from a Canadian former aid worker, calling it ""long but interesting""-and it's hard to disagree:

Since Friday's reporting on the CIA's findings of Russian meddling in the U.S. election, I've been reflecting with a deep sense of foreboding on what this means for future relationships between Russia and the West. So much will hinge upon how the narrative develops, and that provides no comfort at all.

Bear with me?

For several years from 1994 onwards, I was a humanitarian aid worker, researcher, and writer working in and around several of the nastier wars in post-Soviet space-Chechnya, Georgia/Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia/S. Ossetia/Georgia and a few other lesser-known hotspots. For those of us in the international humanitarian community of UN agencies, Red Cross Movement and INGOs, post-Soviet space was uncharted territory fraught with new and lethal difficulties. My job at the time was mostly trying to look at what was working and what wasn't, and to figure out from that how best to safeguard or expand the space available to humanitarian agencies to assist and protect civilians in these wars, all of which were being fought without humanitarian pretensions. Aid workers were getting killed and kidnapped there like nowhere else before, so of course there was a strong element of self-preservation in trying to figure things out, a precursor to acting on our humanitarian impulse and mandates.

Looking back, my Western upbringing left me poorly equipped for figuring out the ""why"" of things to the extent needed for getting things done in that spectacularly shitty and opaque environment. My encounters with American diplomats (and, to a lesser extent, European ones) left me convinced that they tended to be even less well-equipped than I was, often arriving on the scene with deep-seated assumptions about Russia and Russians that almost always made bad problems worse and solutions more elusive. (An important aside here: One exception that stood out was Brady Kiesling, a thoughtful young American diplomat with whom I had many positive and enlightening encounters in the Caucasus. Kiesling, as you might remember, would later leave the U.S. Foreign Service over objections to the Iraq war).

With hindsight, I was slow to discover how important it was to my task at hand to try to see things through Russian / post-Soviet eyes. I got nowhere in understanding Russian political and military behaviour as it was being played out in my stomping ground until I delved into Russian history-particularly the pre-Soviet, Stalin, and WWII-eras. This proved essential not because I was soft-headed, inclined to be lenient, or at all interested in justifying despicable Russian political machinations and atrocious Russian behaviour on the battlefield. Rather, it was simply necessary for the purely pragmatic purposes of figuring out how to prevent stupid things from happening, how to work better at solving, and preventing the problems that were otherwise proving so intractable and deadly.

To get to my point: Leaving aside the huge wildcard that is Donald Trump and his appointees, in the coming days, weeks, and months the U.S. in particular, and perhaps the West in general, may well be forging a new relationship with Russia informed by the recent revelations of Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. We'll be swamped with media attempts to get to the bottom of that meddling. I expect that much Bengazi-esque attention will be focused on demonstrating how Obama failed to protect the U.S. from such an existential threat.

I hope, in the reporting that goes beyond Obama's role, that some serious effort is made at the earliest stage to parse the origins and motivations for the Russian interference, and that it goes well beyond ""Putin = BAD,"" or reductions to an ascendant Russian nationalism, or to an increasing Russian bellicosity-all of which are valid but grossly incomplete explanations of this other, different kind and scale of spectacularly shitty and opaque environment.

My take on this story is that for it to be told with any accuracy, one needs to delve deep into some of the nuances that underlie such a hostile act, some of which I'll try to enumerate here:

the reasons for Russia's profound sense of its perceived abandonment by the U.S. in WWII, with near-catastrophic results; the ensuing animosity toward the West that persisted and grew through the Cold War; the Russian sense of deep humiliation in the post-Soviet era as its entire economic system and its political and military might unravelled; the arguably aggressive, at-best opportunistic stance of NATO in the post-Soviet era-wargaming conflict with an ascendant Russia long before it started to re-ascend, actively recruiting new NATO members and hangers-on in Russia's backyard, and; Russian perceptions of the aggregate of Western efforts in the post-Soviet era to promote ""democratization"" in Russia and its neighbours (by that veritable phalanx of organisations like NDI, IRI, USIP, Open Society Institute, USAID, and a host of others); the imposition of sanctions on Russian elites and how these fed into Russia's already pervasive and isolating ""us against the world"" mindset.

So much grist in all of this for Putin's nationalist mill, but it goes so much further than just that. But just to reiterate: My intent isn't to argue for leniency toward Russia or to diminish its actions in any way, but to underscore the need to take Russian perceptions into account when formulating policy directions in the difficult period to come.

Update: Shortly after this reader roundup went live, my colleague Russell detailed how McConnell finally stepped up :

The Senate will investigate claims that Russia interfered in the election on behalf of Donald Trump-whether the president-elect likes it or not. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday gave his backing to bipartisan inquiries after the CIA reportedly concluded that not only did Russia meddle in the campaign, it did so with the goal of elevating Trump over Hillary Clinton. ... On Monday, McConnell broke sharply with Trump on the Russia question and in his confidence in the CIA's credibility. ""The Russians are not our friends,"" he told reporters at the Capitol...

Update : Here's a reader dissent over Fallows's ""Landslide Donald"" note :

After Barack Obama's re-election in 2012, respected left-leaning national publications such as The Nation , and an op-ed writer at The Los Angeles Times , described the event as an ""electoral college landslide."" Obama's Electoral College count was 332-206, which wasn't substantially better than Donald Trump's at 306-232. And Obama won the popular vote by a margin of less than 4 percent-but still, there were those on the Left who described it as a type of ""landslide."" But The Nation went so far as to declare that since Obama won a majority of states, he had a mandate. (Trump won 33.)

So I think the Trump campaign's desire to call this one a ""landslide"" is understandable. It doesn't rise precisely to the level of Obama's 2012 victory, but it's fairly close. And a reasonable argument may be made that psychologically and politically, it had the same effect as a landslide.

The Democrats also blew a golden opportunity to take control of the Senate, and 2018 doesn't look good either, with the Democrats defending 25 out of 33 seats-many of them in Red States that voted for Trump by a comfortable margin. They lost roughly 900 seats at the state legislative level, and they're down to 11 governors.

The Supreme Court replacement for Antonin Scalia, and most likely replacements for Ginsburg and Breyer as well, will come from Trump's Heritage Foundation candidate list. At the Cabinet level, Trump is picking a Who's Who from the Republican anti-Obama brigade, including three generals who told Obama that withdrawing from Iraq so precipitously was a bad idea, and found their military careers abruptly at an end.

""Elections have consequences,"" said Obama, and this one was very consequential at all levels and in all three branches of government. The comprehensive and lasting nature of this defeat is gradually being realized by the Left, and it's causing a great deal of depression and despair. ( The Atlantic just posted a story about "" a cure for post-election malaise ."")

So although this may not have been a genuine landslide according to the strictest of terms, I suggest it has had the same effect.

***

Circling back to the nihilism theme, here's one more reader note (also forwarded by Fallows), this time commenting on Trump's call to Taiwan and his general contempt for political norms-which eventually leads to ""anarchy and nihilism,"" according to our reader:

I'm watching, with continued horror, the responses you are getting to your tweets on the Taiwan phone call. I'm horrified at the utter ignorance of key people regarding the dangers of failing to observe norms in international relations. So this is a supplement to my earlier emails to you about the importance of normativity domestically.

To review, there is no concrete, structural, real-world, tangible thing holding our society together. It is a shared consensus on the (slippery) meaning of words, and on the processes by which our institutions operate. Reality check: If humans were instantaneously to disappear from the face of the planet, what would the Constitution really be? A piece of paper with black squiggles on it, functionally indistinguishable from toilet paper. That is the extent of the solid, reliable fundament on which everything inside our borders rests. Everything else is normative, a shared consensus of meaning and consequence.

This is why the ""there are no facts"" meme that you have been highlighting is so important. If there are no facts, if there is no observable truth to which we strive to adhere, then there is nothing. We have reached anarchy and nihilism, and whoever has the biggest muscle and the biggest gun prevails: the absolute state of nature. We start all over again.

And everything that keeps our lives stable and predictable absolutely depends on observing those norms. The things which feel solid and concrete that we expect when we wake up in the morning-from coffee, to warmth, to having a job, to having a retirement account on which to depend-all of it is absolutely dependent on the observance of those norms. We take the fragility of our lives and of our society much, much, much too much for granted. And the stability which we have come to expect-indeed, to believe is solid-is as fragile as a sandcastle approaching high tide when the norms are disturbed.

And the fragility of domestic norms are ironclad compared to the norms that have developed over the centuries internationally. Communication between countries and foreign cultures is based upon far more fragile, and even less definable norms. There is no constitution, no law books, no Supreme Court, not even a shared language. This is what makes the foreign service establishment SOOO essential, and SOOO important to be cultivated and treasured and respected. Something as (domestically) innocuous as a congratulatory phone call can, internationally, be the basis for withdrawing formal consular recognition. In international diplomatic parlance, the mere placement of an eyelash can have profound meaning and devastating consequences. And the normative fragility internationally can have tremendous, lasting, destabilizing consequences.

I reiterate that we take our stability for granted. We fly from coast to coast. We fly internationally. But look at what happened when stability was shattered in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria. At least with the murderous dictators in power in those countries, the consequences were contained. When we shattered the stability by our interventions, the puss has poured all over the world, and it has destabilized cultures to the point that we have Trump.

Yes. I tie the rise of Donald Trump directly to GWB's intervention in Iraq. (Yes, we are the strongest power in the world. But we are not omnipotent. Our strength is in our willingness to exercise self-restraint. We were the strongest power in history of the world on the day before the invasion of Iraq occurred. Once we invaded, our weaknesses and our vulnerabilities became blazingly obvious.)

As a species, we have built an elaborate structure of norms to protect us from the absolute state of nature. The absolute state of nature is the only concrete thing which can, with absolute assurance, stop the fall from the dissolution of norms.

In the last election I have heard many, many seemingly intelligent people say that they voted for Trump because everything is corrupt, and they just wanted to blow things up. I think these people fail realistically to account for how little in their lives they can truly count on. International stability and predictability and normativity rest on a hair's breadth. And the degree to which Trump's ignorant shenanigans can permanently disrupt international stability (not to mention domestic stability) and the normative structures that maintain what stability there is, is deeply, deeply unappreciated in the response to the Taiwan affair, and, indeed, to the election of Trump.

This is a justification, if not for panic, then for deep, deep, deep concern, and extraordinary intervention.

The Seahawks have been one of the league's most consistent and productive rushing offenses since 2012. More than that, they've taken great pride in that identity. It meant something to them.

But that's not the identity of this team. The Seahawks entered the day ranked 22 nd in the NFL in rushing yards. In the first half against the 49ers, they rushed for 20 yards on nine carries. The 49ers entered the game allowing the most total rushing yards, the most yards per carry and the most rushing touchdowns this season.

The Seahawks improved some in the second half behind rookie running back Alex Collins, who ripped off a couple of nice runs. But a couple of nice runs don't change what has been clear for most of this season: The Seahawks just can't run the ball.

More than that, defenses are able to defend the Seahawks differently this year than they have in the last several seasons. They play more coverages with two safeties, eliminating space for receivers and making it harder to pass. They no longer need to load the line of scrimmage to stop the Seahawks.

It's hard to win in the playoffs consistently without consistently being able to run the ball, and that's a new problem for the Seahawks.

""Now they've become much like all the other teams that they used to beat with that mentality,"" said former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks a couple weeks ago. ""They've kind of morphed into a finesse team that has to lean on the passing game.""

2431819105,"Las escalofriantes predicciones de Nostradamus que se hacen viral en la red

 
NostradamusFuente: YouTube
01/01/2017 Ocio

 
Nostradamus, cuyo nombre era Michel de Nostre-Dame (1503 - 1566), era un boticario de origen francés que predijo una serie de profecías y las publicó en un libro mundialmente famoso llamado Las Profecías o Les Propheties.
El francés predijo el ataque terrorista a las Torres Gemelas de Nueva York, el cual que ocurrió el 11 de septiembre de 2001.
Nació el 14 de diciembre de 1503 en una pequeña localidad del sur de Francia, y desde su infancia destacó por su gran interés en la lectura y los idiomas, al mismo tiempo que su bisabuelo comenzó a instruirle en el campo que lo haría famoso: las ciencias astrales.
Después de estudiar medicina y contraer matrimonio, Nostradamus comenzó a hacer uso de su presunta capacidad para predecir el futuro, logrando publicar desde horóscopos hasta almanaques.
LAS PREDICCIONES DE NOSTRADAMUS PARA 2017
1. CHINA SERÁ LA GRAN POTENCIA MUNDIAL.

 
En 2017, los esfuerzos del gobierno chino por tener la hegemonía económica global darán sus frutos sobre los Estados Unidos, que apenas acaba de elegir como presidente al multimillonario Donald Trump.
Los más acérrimos creyentes aseguran que Nostradamus hizo referencia a Trump como ""tromba o trompeta"".
Centuria I, Cuarteta XL (40)
""La tromba falsa disimulando locura. Hará Bizancio un cambio de leyes. Saldrá de Egipto, que quiere que se desate.Edicto cambiando moneda y valor.""
Entonces si Trump es la ""tromba falsa"", entonces Nostradamus predice que el futuro presidente de los Estados Unidos se volverá loco.
2. UN GRAN TERREMOTO ACONTECERÁ EN ESTADOS UNIDOS.
El estado de California, donde se encuentra la falla de San Andrés, no resistirá la presión de las placas tectónicas de la Tierra y producirá un enorme movimiento en el norte de América.
En los últimos meses del 2016 se han registrado decenas de temblores en con epicentro en el extremo sur de la falla de San Andrés que han sacudido la localidad de Bombay Beach, en el Salton Sea, un área poco poblada del condado de San Diego
3. EL PAPA MORIRÁ.
Nostradamus predijo que el líder de la Iglesia Católica fallecería en 2017, lo cual no le da muchas esperanzas al papa Francisco, a menos de otro líder sea establecido en su lugar.
4.- ITALIA DERRIBARÁ A EUROPA.
Según el médico, Italia tendrá una enorme crisis en su economía, lo cual la hará el centro de una crisis mayor en Europa.
La crisis de la deuda europea se desencadenó por una serie de acontecimientos en el sector bancario de Estados Unidos. Cuando la ralentización de la economía de los Estados Unidos impidió a gran número de propietarios americanos reembolsar sus hipotecas, bancos de todo el mundo que tenían inversiones relacionadas con esas hipotecas empezaron a perder dinero.
5. CONFLICTOS Y GUERRAS
Los países de Latinoamérica sufrirán grandes cambios sociales y políticos y se cree que podrían sufrir guerras civiles, así como preferencias por los gobiernos alejados de la izquierda.
Centuria I, Cuarteta LVII (57)
""Por gran discordia la tromba temblará, Acuerdo roto levantado la testa al Cielo.Boca sangrante en la sangre nadará,Al suelo la cara untada de leche y miel.""
Para poner en perspectiva esta cuarteta, algunos interpretan la ""tierra de leche y miel"" como Israel. Algunos creen que esta cuarteta podría estar refiriéndose al inicio de la Tercera Guerra Mundial.
6. EL CALENTAMIENTO GLOBAL.
La falta de recursos naturales en el mundo se intensificará al grado de provocar que las potencias mundiales entren en conflictos armados para satisfacer sus necesidades básicas.
7.- ENERGÍA SOLAR EN AUGE.
2017 será el año del Sol, pues predijo que la energía solar sería la alternativa ecológica para muchos de los problemas económicos y biológicos de nuestro planeta.
Ya existe el Solar Impulse es un proyecto ubicado principalmente en Suiza para desarrollar un avión alimentado únicamente mediante energía solar fotovoltaica.
8. VIAJES ESPACIALES.
Al fin la tecnología será tan avanzada que será común realizar viajes espaciales alrededor de la órbita terrestre.
La NASA anunció las fechas previstas para las primeras misiones tripuladas de las nuevas naves de la iniciativa privada, la CST-100 de Boeing y la Dragon V2 de SpaceX. Como se esperaba, la agencia espacial norteamericana confirmó que los primeros vuelos tripulados tendrán lugar en 2017.
Seis años después de la retirada del transbordador espacial. Pero -sorpresa, sorpresa- la primera nave estadounidense que llevará astronautas de la NASA al espacio no será el vehículo de SpaceX, sino la CST-100 de Boeing."

2431822400,"For me this is the third post of the day, and probably the last in this space for quite a while.

Effective today, I'm beginning a five-month book-writing leave from online and print activities for the Atlantic. At the start of June I plan to be back, recharged for the fray, and by then my wife Deb and I should-will!- have finished a book on the America we've seen in our travels across the country these past four years, and what that means for the years ahead.

Some practical notes:A major satisfaction in writing in this space and its precursors since the mid-1990s has been engagement with readers. But by the final few chaotic months of this year's campaign, I had given up even pretending to answer reader emails (or any emails), or sorting them for reader-comment posts. There are still hundreds I would like to have quoted but have not managed to use. I will soon forward some of those, and anything that arrives in coming weeks, to the impresario of our Notes section, Chris Bodenner, who has skillfully curated reader discussions. And not for the first time I'll be considering the ""email bankruptcy"" option.

. The last time I took a blogging leave was five years ago, when Deb and I moved back to China for me to finish my book China Airborne. (Her wonderful Dreaming in Chinese had just come out.) Back then, the concept of ""blogging"" still existed-that is, of frequent, incremental, voicey dispatches on a range of personalized topics-and I had the joy of assembling a stellar cast of guest bloggers to fill in. Really, it was an incredible group: check them out here. Times have changed, and there is no longer a set personal-blog space here for guests to fill. Our site keeps evolving, and I'm not sure what it will offer by the middle of this year. But for now you will just have to make do with the dozens of other items the Atlantic serves up each day.

. Why a cold-turkey break? For an external reason, and an internal one.

The external reason involves the new reality of the Donald Trump era. During the final six months of his campaign, I tried to keep up with the ""norm-breaking,"" unprecedented things the candidate kept doing and saying. That became a nearly full-time activity, and the number of entries ultimately reached 152. Since the election, the pace of Trump's transgressions and aberrations has only increased. As a reporter you can keep up with this, in the full intensity it deserves, or you can do anything else. I am 100% on board in supporting the reporters, editors, and analysts at the Atlantic and elsewhere who are girding for daily engagement with the implications of Trump. But I think that the greatest journalistic value I can add is not by spending all my time as one more voice in the fact-check/ norm-defense patrol but instead in reporting on how the rest of the country can and should respond. And I know that the latter is the story I am more excited to tell.

. This leads to the other, internal reason, which involves my personal journalistic metronome. Through my long career with the Atlantic I've had a sequence of shifts in topic and location. Through the early 1980s, I was heavily involved in debates about the military and budgetary policies of the incoming Ronald Reagan administration, including with my book National Defense. After five years of this, my family moved to Asia, to spend the late Reagan and early GHW Bush years viewing the U.S. from outside (and for me to do my books More Like Us and Looking at the Sun). I'll skip ahead several topics and moves to the early 2000s, when I was back in Washington and heavily involved in debates about responding to the 9/11 attacks and invading Iraq (don't do it!). After four-plus years of that, and reporting on the aftermath, in 2006 my wife and I moved to China, to spend the late GW Bush and early Obama eras seeing that country and viewing the U.S. from its perspective.

This time, I've done what I can through the past year to lay out the consequences of this year's presidential choice. Those consequences are now upon us. As with every other major shift in national direction, the resulting story needs to be told at many levels. The version of the story I'm most passionate about telling, and that I believe is least likely to tell itself otherwise, involves the implications of what we've seen in dozens of places like San Bernardino and Sioux Falls and Erie and Allentown and Ajo and Greenville and Columbus and Charleston and Dodge City and Duluth.

. The good and the bad of being in Washington is that what happens in national politics is right in front of you, unavoidably in your face all day long. The good part is why we've lived here for half of the past 40 years. The bad part is why we've lived elsewhere during the other half, in several-year installments.

These next few months will be an ""other half"" period. We'll be based in inland Southern California, in Redlands, for the writing-camp period. And I'm undertaking a variety of additional ""mind in the right place""/attention-protective moves, from reading more things on paper to being less exposed to cable TV. Related: the more time passes, the more I find myself agreeing with Andrew Sullivan's famed essay on this topic. The public's attention really has been treated as a free good in the tech-distraction era. We need to fight to protect it. Or at least I do.

. Might there be an exception the online sabbatical? Anything is possible. Suppose Xi Jinping were to announce that he's personally taking up small-plane aviation, in a speech that begins ""I often think of the example of the boiling frog"" and ends ""may God Bless the United States of America!"" (which would be quite a speech), all while holding a leafblower in one hand and a craft beer in the other. I'd probably have to say something. Online life changes and moves on, even more quickly than life in general. There are inevitable costs to stepping away. But in this case I believe there are greater benefits. See you in June.

NASA's new ""mixtape"" is light on music, but heavy on groundbreaking scientific research.

The organization's Goddard Space Flight Center just dropped the tape - in the form of a YouTube video - that samples some of its most notable efforts in 2016.

The Maryland-based center is the nation's largest organization of scientists and engineers who build spacecraft and technology to study the Earth, our solar system and the universe.

In 2016, its Hubble operations helped scientists determine that the observable universe has 10 times more galaxies than we previously thought. Goddard's Operation IceBridge measured the volatile Antarctic ice for the eighth year in a row. The center also launched the nation's first asteroid sampling mission into space.

2431832478,"ANALYSIS/OPINION

LANDOVER - When I wrote last week that Sunday's game at FedEx Field would be an easy win for a Washington Redskins team fighting for a place in the NFL postseason against a New York Giants club with its playoff berth already clinched, I counted on a few things.

One, that Redskins coach Jay Gruden and his staff would have looked at the right game films to prepare for this game.

Two, that Giants coach Ben McAdoo would not foolishly put his starters at risk by playing them for very long in a game that should have amounted to a preseason preparation game for the Giants.

Silly me.

This 19-10 loss was arguably the worst loss for this Redskins (8-7-1) franchise in decades: A loss against a team with no particular reason to play to win against a Washington team with everything on the table, including a second-straight playoff appearance, with a win (barring a tie in the Sunday night game between the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions).

And it wasn't just the loss - it was how they lost. This Redskins team was so unprepared and lifeless in such an important game that it raises fundamental questions about Gruden and his coaches, beyond just the defensive coordinator, Joe Barry, who is expected to be looking for work following this season.

It was such a bad performance that you have to wonder if Gruden indeed, now finishing his third season as the Redskins head coach, can prepare a team to win. You also have to ask if Kirk Cousins, playing under the franchise tag this year, is truly the quarterback that can lead a team to win in a game like this - a game like the Green Bay playoff game last season where Cousins crumbled under the pressure.

Gruden, with the loss all over his face and eyes, was asked in the post-game press conference if he thought he had the ability to get a team ready to play such a high-stakes game - a legitimate question. """"I'd like to think so,"" he answered. ""But the results say otherwise.""

I jokingly suggested earlier in this column that Gruden and his staff might have studied the wrong game films to prepare for the Giants, but that would actually be a more palatable explanation for his woeful game plan to open up against the Giants than the real reason he and his brilliant sidekick, offensive coordinator Sean McVay, were outcoached on an embarrassing level.

The opening script of plays, which has been Gruden's and McVay's strong suit, usually resulting in Cousins methodically moving his team down the field, was more ""Ishtar"" than ""Casablanca"" Sunday afternoon against the Giants (11-5).

The one time Gruden finally got it right - winning the coin toss and electing to receive the ball, rather than defer and volunteer to put his defense on the field to open the game - he wasted that opening opportunity with an opening series of plays that began with a one-yard run by Robert Kelley, an eight-yard completion to Jordan Reed short of the first down and then another run by Kelley for no gain. Three and out, the Washington Redskins.

The next time Gruden and McVay got the ball on offense, the series opened with a five-yard sack of Cousins, a five-yard run by Kelley and then another eight-yard Cousins pass short of the first down, this one to Chris Thompson. Three and out, the Washington Redskins.

""I don't know what happened,"" Gruden said. ""They (the Giants) made us flat.""

The Giants, with Eli Manning and the first-teamers on the field, would put three points on the board on a 22-yard field goal by Robbie Gould for a 3-0 lead at the end of the quarter. New York had four first downs to one for Washington and 73 yards of offense compared to 22 for the Redskins.

Still, how much longer would McAdoo keep his starters on the field? Whatever point he was trying to make, he had already made it. Why risk injury to Manning, his prize receiver Odell Beckham and other starters?

What if the Giants had such little regard for the Redskins defense that they didn't think it was a risk? After all, in order to injure Eli Manning, you have to first hit him.

You don't have to be Richie Petitbon to come up with a game plan that would have blitzed Manning, at any cost, early and often, to hit him early and often. No matter how much of an idiot McAdoo was for keeping his prize quarterback on the field for the entire game, even Forrest Gump would have pulled Manning out early if he was getting hit often.

Then, maybe against Giants backup quarterback Josh Johnson, the Redskins might have had a chance.

Instead, the Giants marched up and down the field with no fear of anything. The Redskins crawled on the field as if they were scared of everything, and went into the locker room down 10-0.

The count and the amount? New York had 12 first downs in the half, compared to four for Washington. New York had 194 yards of offense, compared to 83 for Washington. And that Redskins defense was on the field for nearly 19 minutes of the half.

And then it got worse.

There was Eli Manning, back on the field to open the second half, and Cousins, showing little ability to muster his teammates on any kind of offensive run, wasted a 49-yard completion to Pierre Garcon in the third quarter with an interception by D. Rodgers-Cromartie. Then came the death knell - Rodgers-Cromartie's second interception of a Cousins pass to Garcon on the Redskins drive down the field with less than two minutes remaining, down 13-10.

Cousins put up elite numbers for a second straight seasons - 25 touchdowns, 4,917 yard passing, breaking his own franchise record from last season. But games like Sunday's raise legitimate questions about whether or not the Redskins should invest long-term elite quarterback money in a guy who could not do more in such an important game, with seemingly everything in favor of his team - playing at home against an opponent with nothing to play for except playoff preparation.

Gruden was asked about the future of Cousins. ""I believe he is an NFL starting quarterback,"" he responded, and then added the multi-million question - ""hopefully here.""

And what about the general manager, Scot McCloughan, who put together this shameful defense? Whose No. 1 draft pick, Josh Doctson, only got on the field twice this year because of injuries and mysteries? Whose Marshawn Lynch look-alike draft pick from last season, running back Matt Jones, didn't even dress for the second half of the season?

The trio of McCloughan, Gruden and Cousins may still be the long-term answer for this franchise to progress, but, as Sydney Greenstreet, the Fat Man, said in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""In the heat of action men are likely to forget where their best interests lie and let their emotions carry them away.""

A loss like Sunday's can let anyone's emotions carry them away.

2431837749,"The Chinese government should set a more flexible target for economic growth this year to give more space for reform efforts, a central bank adviser told the official Xinhua news agency in comments published on Sunday.

China's economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier and looks set to achieve the government's full-year forecast of 6.5-7 percent, buoyed by higher government spending, a housing boom and record bank lending.

However, growing debt and concerns about property bubbles have touched off an internal debate about whether China should tolerate slower growth in 2017 to allow more room for painful reforms aimed at reducing industrial overcapacity and indebtedness. Huang Yiping, a monetary policy committee member of the central People's Bank of China and Peking University professor, told Xinhua that China's GDP growth target range should be 6-7 percent for this year, compared with 6.5-7 percent in 2016.

""The 6.5 percent target is just an average rate,"" Huang said. ""As long as employment is stable, a slightly wider growth target range in the short term will reduce the need for pro-growth efforts and give policy makers more room to focus on reforms."" | This year's growth target will determine the government's monetary policy, Huang said.

""Large-scale monetary loosening is unlikely, while the possibility of tightening can not be ruled out,"" he added, citing inflation concerns, higher U.S. interest rates and a weakening yuan.

While the yuan is under pressure from U.S. interest rate rises in the short term, Huang said the yuan's exchange rate will be ""largely unaffected by investors' expectations about China's economic growth,"" Xinhua said.

As Chinese people diversify their investment portfolio, capital outflow will ""last only for a certain period"" in future, Huang added.

In 2016, the yuan posted its biggest annual loss against the dollar since 1994, making it the worst performing major Asian currency during the year.

2431839849,"If you believe Sidney Lumet, he never had a ""vision"" for his more than 50 films and never launched a project with the idea of making a ""message"" movie.

Those familiar with such Lumet creations as ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""12 Angry Men,"" ""The Pawnbroker"" or ""Network"" would have every right to be skeptical of the late filmmaker's assertions, except that the source was a man for whom truth was almost a sacred trust.

In fact, the director of the ""American Masters"" documentary ""By Sidney Lumet"" asks rhetorically, ""Has there ever been a more honest filmmaker than Sidney Lumet?"" The film airs Tuesday, Jan. 3, on KQED.

Nancy Buirski has skillfully augmented a lengthy 2008 interview with Lumet by the late filmmaker Daniel Anker with scenes from the director's films, including stills from movies and stage plays in which he appeared as a successful child actor, to create a fascinating overview of Lumet's career and, by extension, a consideration of why his style of filmmaking was right for its time but sadly missing in today's commercial cinematic landscape.

Lumet, who died in 2011, was the son of famed veterans of the Yiddish theater. His father, Baruch, was especially well known and was responsible for nudging Sidney onto the stage. It didn't take much. He appeared in a number of plays, including a couple on Broadway (""Dead End""), and then made several short films.

At one point, Hollywood child actor Freddie Bartholomew was dragging his feet about renewing his contract with MGM, so Sidney was put on the studio payroll by Louis B. Mayer in an effort make Freddie's handlers feel some pressure. During the time he was useful in that way, Sidney was promised all kinds of opportunities. The minute Freddie signed a new contract, Sidney was dropped.

After service in World War II, he formed his own actors workshop and began developing plays in New York's Greenwich Village. An acquaintance who was already working as a director in the nascent television industry suggested that he try his hand directing TV. The pal was Yul Brynner, who got him a job directing TV shows.

Lumet took to the new profession and was valued for the speed and efficiency with which he directed TV projects. When Henry Fonda was looking to get a film made of ""12 Angry Men,"" someone suggested Lumet to direct. Fonda recalled seeing Lumet in live theater and gave the go-ahead for Lumet to enter the next and most important phase of his career.

Lumet was exceptionally prolific, yet while we think of a Lumet film as gritty, probably set in New York and laced with a strong sense of social justice, there were many other films that didn't fit that categorization.

""Murder on the Orient Express"" (1974), for example, with an all-star cast (Ingrid Bergman's mewling worry about the fate of ""little brown babies"" won her a supporting actress Oscar), was a typical studio blockbuster. ""The Wiz"" (1978) was a tuneful film musical based on the Broadway show, but was also a critical and commercial failure in spite of the fact that it featured Diana Ross as Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow.

Lumet loved New York and only felt alive, he tells us, when he was in that city. It's not a coincidence that so many of his great films were made and set in New York. We feel the heat of the city in ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" almost smell the warming asphalt. ""Serpico"" mirrors the confined space and shadows of a populous city that never sleeps.

Lumet is the only speaker in the documentary, but PBS has appended an interview with Treat Williams, who starred in ""Prince of the City."" The film includes very little about Lumet's life other than his childhood in New York. The closest the film comes to his personal life as an adult is a clip of Lena Horne as Glinda in ""The Wiz"" - her daughter, Gail, was one of Lumet's four wives, as was Gloria Vanderbilt.

Granted, the film is fascinating and important as it is, and Buirski made the right decision in focusing largely on the Anker interviews with Lumet. ""By Sidney Lumet"" may not answer every question we might have about his career, but it does succeed in making the case that his films should not be forgotten.

2431843035,"Newman's Castle in Bellville, Texas.(Photo: KHOU-TV)

BELLVILLE, Texas -- Seasons come and go in Bellville, Texas, but one gem in the small Texas town is constant.

Newman's Bakery is a fixture. It's a place where reading is as comforting as the coffee and pastries. Freshness is provided daily, and owner Mike Newman wouldn't have it any other way.

""Everybody here knows who I am,"" Newman said. ""Though I can't recall everyone else's name, they seem to know my name.""

For 33 years, he's made sure the place runs perfectly.

""It's a good way to have an impact on the community,"" Newman said. ""This is my hometown.""

His four-mile drive home after work each day takes him down country roads and gravel driveways. It's part of the adventure, considering where he lives.

""I wanted to do more than make donuts,"" Newman said. ""I've built me quite a house out here. After all, a man's home is his castle.""

So he decided to build a castle of his own. But how exactly do you go about starting a project like that?

""I came out here one afternoon with a lawn chair and ... a bottle of champagne also,"" Newman said. ""I sat in the lawn chair and started looking around, trying to envision things.""

The castle sits on a 20-acre piece of land made out of cinder blocks and masonry stucco. It features a working drawbridge that crosses a full moat, a 62-foot tall bell tower, a chapel and a dungeon.

""My friends looked at me like I was crazy,"" Newman said of the initial construction stages. ""I was stubborn and bull-headed.""

So much so that instead of hiring out a contractor to work on the site, he and single assistant built the castle by themselves. It took eight years until he could move into the 3,400-square-foot living space and 10 years total to complete.

""I have actually looked up at some of these things and say, 'Did I actually build that?'"" Newman said. ""It's very self-rewarding.""

These days, Newman opens up his home for tours to people of all ages. In fact, he's adding to the property, building additional guest rooms to host larger parties.

And each time he leads a group through the castle, he wears his crown.

""It lets them know who's king,"" Newman said with a smile.

If you would like to tour Newman's Castle, you can make a reservation by calling Newman's Bakery in Bellville at (979)-865-9804. On the day of the tour, guests are asked to meet at the bakery at 10:15 a.m. to pay for your ticket, which includes a box lunch to be served on-site. Directions to the castle will be given upon arrival at the bakery. For more information, visit www.newmanscastle.com.

2431844569,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Memphis has many nicknames: Bluff City, Barbecued Pork Capital of the World, Home of the Blues.

But whatever you wish to call Tennessee's largest city, which sits astride the Mississippi, its treasures of music, history, food and culture are there to see if you just know where to look.

It was here that the blues made its first logical stop on its gradual climb northward from the Mississippi Delta, with Beale St. now the local epicenter of its magic. It was here as well that a rock star and native son of the Magnolia State set up his multimillion-dollar estate. And it was here that one of the lions of the civil rights movement breathed his last on an April morning in 1968.

Memphis has so much to experience, but above all is its music, which permeates every aspect of its identity, great and small. The Washington Times spent a weekend walking in Memphis to see, experience and eat and drink in all that this amazing place has to offer.

Friday:

For reasons known only to air carriers, it is all but impossible to fly directly from the District to Memphis, requiring at least one - or, in my case, thanks to a broken plane at DCA, two - transfers to get me on the ground in Tennessee.

No matter, as I grab an Uber and head into downtown Memphis, where I soon find myself at the exquisite Madison Hotel (79 Madison Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, 901/333-1200). This is, to put it mildly, a wonderful joint. My room, a suite, is tremendously apportioned, with a living area offering couch, TV, fridge and even iPod- and iPhone-connecting speakers. The chambers itself feature a king bed of pure comfort, with French doors looking directly at the TV in the sitting room for bedtime watching. The bathroom offers both a shower and a tub, and I'm immediately feeling at home.

The welcome is made ever sweeter thanks to a gift from the Memphis Convention & Visitors Bureau that includes locally sourced chocolates, coffee grounds and, of course, the requisite Elvis sunglasses - which I'm told can somehow be worn unironically in this burg.

It's been quite a day of traveling, and I'm in need of sustenance. Just down the way from the Madison is the charming Cafe Keough (12 S Main St, Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, 901/509-2469). I opt for the salami sandwich, served with mozzarella, spinach, fennel and basil pesto, and fresh-brewed iced tea, with a side of beef soup just like mom used to make. The home-baked cookies at the counter are calling my name, so I indulge one to go.

Happily sated, I head southwest to the Stax Museum of American Soul Music (926 E. McLemore Ave., Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, 901/261-6338). I am greeted by Tim Sampson, communications director for the Soulsville Foundation, a local nonprofit that raises funds for the Stax Music Academy and The Soulsville Charter School, which works to help children prepare for college and life via an intensive program of performing arts classes. It's a great charity in a town that has suffered so much but is seeking to amend some of those past wounds.

Tim walks me next door to the renovated facade of Stax, as the original edifice was torn down and the entire block around it left to the elements at one time. But now, thanks to the efforts of Tim, civic leaders and donors, the story of Stax can once again be told.

In the extensive, interactive museum, I learn how it was here at Stax where the luminaries of soul came to record. Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Booker T. and the MGs and so many others put radio staple songs to acetate in this place, and Stax's deal with Atlantic Records allowed their voices to extend far beyond the Delta and creep into speakers all around America.

Like most such galleries, Stax features clothing worn by the likes of Ike and Tina Turner, as well as Issac Hayes' pimped-out Cadillac Eldorado, which was often seen cruising the streets of Memphis. There's also a nonstop ""Express Yourself"" dance floor, featuring live renditions of tunes from the era projected on the wall of the ersatz disco - afros and all. (I admit to having Tim take video of me dancing there.)

Soon enough it's dinnertime, so Tim and I head to the hip Overton Square neighborhood to dine at Lafayette's Music Room (2119 Madison Ave, Memphis, Tennessee, 38104, 901/207-5097), a do-drop-in that serves up down-home Southern cooking while you enjoy live blues music. Tonight soul artist Marcella Simien is up on the stage, a well-known Zydeco player of these parts.

Tim and I are joined by Jeff Hulett, the director of public relations for the Memphis Convention & Visitors Bureau, and a longtime resident of these parts. Like Tim, Jeff has an easy, welcoming manner, and offers suggestions from the menu from having dined here several times before.

For starters we go with the fried green tomatoes, which I've never much fancied, but these particular offerings are divine, supplemented by some stellar crab dip. To lubricate the evening, I go in for a blueberry lemonade spiked with Pickers, Tennessee's first craft vodka.

Being in a Southern-fried mood, I opt for the shrimp po' boy for my entree, which is not as amazing as the appetizers, but nonetheless is filling. I top it off with a High Cotton ESB, a local brew.

Oh, but we're not done, Jeff says. For right outside Lafayette's is Amurica, a traveling trailer that entices the dutifully sloppy to come in and take photographs with props like flags, hats and various ephemera. Jeff and I do this, and upon seeing the results, I assure you, it was worth it. (Ask nicely and I may even share.)

Before bed I take a stroll up and down Beale St., a pedestrian-only zone of juke joints including , where an impersonator of the Killer in his younger days plays both the guitar and the piano channeling Mr. Lewis, right down to igniting the piano with lighter fluid to produce those ""great balls of fire,"" and nearby Silky O'Sullivan's, famous for its dueling pianists. The block has also been immortalized in song, thanks to Marc Cohn's ""Walking in Memphis"" and its mention of walking ""10 feet off of Beale.""

Unfortunately, Beale is a bit dead this evening, what with winter cold keeping the Southerners at bay. There's still enough drink and music to scratch my itch for blues, but frankly the scene of locals partying at Overton Square was more enthralling than this tourist trap.

I'll return some other time when it's more happening.

Saturday:

It was named for Grace, a relative of S.E. Toof, who owned a 500-acre horse farm that eventually came to include a mansion to go along with ample area for the horses to roam.

Then, in 1957, a 22-year-old man named Elvis Presley purchased the estate, and while he would spend years placing his own touch on the property, he would retain its name: Graceland.

Here in Memphis, visitors can come to see Presley's home at Graceland (Elvis Presley Blvd, Memphis, Tennessee, 38116, 901/332-3322), where the King lived until his untimely death - inside the home - in 1977 at the tender age of 42.

But what a life Presley experienced in those two and two score years. Here at Graceland, the visitor can walk his crib, explore the grounds and peer at exhibits and memorabilia from across the rock legend's life and career.

From the visitor center across the street, we are shuttled via bus to the front steps of the mansion, where a docent informs us of the purchase price the King made for the property ($100,000, or nearly $1 million in 2016 moneys) and how, with the absolute best effort possible, the property remains as true to its 1977 decor as possible.

This is seen as soon as you enter the home. Stepping into the foyer, you turn to the right and see a sitting room featuring yellow stained-glass windows inset with peacock designs and yellow paneling. As it's December, a large white Christmas tree stands erect in front of a piano and old-school TV in the distance. Across the hall is the massive dining room, adorned too with holiday decorations.

The entire interior is frozen in time, allowing you to experience Graceland much as Presley saw it in the final years of his life, right down to the green shag carpet in the Jungle Room, the side-by-side-by-side TVs in the King's basement lounge that allowed him to watch ""all three"" networks at once, the pool room and many others.

In the backyard you can walk into the stables, converted into office space, and then into the racquetball building, which houses Presley's massive collection of gold records, Grammys, martial arts memorabilia and various other accolades from across his career. Don't forget to also check out his uniform from his stint in the Army.

Then take a stroll over to the swimming pool and the family plot, where Presley is buried alongside his parents, his grandmother and his brother, who died in childbirth. Sit silently here and reflect on how much this man gave in his relatively short life.

If you purchase the full VIP ticket tour, you can also check out other exhibits such as ""Elvis in Hawaii"" and ""Elvis in Hollywood,"" plus the King's rather sizable automobile collection and, a must, his custom planes, including his pride and joy, the Lisa Marie, named for his daughter.

You can spend hours at Graceland, and how much you want to see will dictate how much you spend. The mansion and grounds are an absolute must, and if you have more time, the exhibits are worth checking out too.

Leaving the King's digs behind, I head back into town to meet Jeff and Tim for lunch at

Central BBQ (147 E Butler Ave., Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, 901/672-7760), for if there's one thing Memphis is known for besides music, it's the fiery pits of cooking bliss.

The fellas have ordered for me prior to arrival, and all I can say is dear God in heaven! First stop is the BBQ nachos, an indulgence of pulled pork, BBQ sauce, shredded cheese and jalapenos. Honestly, this pretty much qualifies as a meal in and of itself. This is followed by macaroni and cheese, BBQ beans and a rack of ribs that is pretty much larger than I am.

It's a lot of food, and the portions certainly have their way with me. (I'm going on a diet in 2017, I swear.)

This morning I received a message from a friend from middle and high school, Chad, whom I haven't seen since graduation two decades ago. He and his family happen to be in Memphis, his wife's home town, and so I have invited him to join us. Chad shows up, which is a surreal moment. He studied divinity locally and now works as a missionary in Africa, work for which adds to lunch amazing tales to go along with our food.

And proving that the entire South is just one big small town, it turns out that Tim in fact knows Chad's wife!

Despite being on a high from an amazing day thus far, it's necessary that I walk across the street from Central BBQ to a very special place. For it was here, at the preserved Lorraine Motel, that Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed by James Earl Ray April 4, 1968. The Lorraine, I learn, catered to black travelers at a time when the much of the South - including Memphis - remained segregated. Dr. King's death would spur riots around the country, but remarkably, not in Memphis, where Dr. King had come to help mediate a strike by the city's sanitation workers - and which would be settled not long after his death.

The Lorraine is now part of the National Civil Rights Museum (450 Mulberry St, Memphis, Tennessee, 38103, 901/521-9699). Here you can spend a whole or part of the day perusing exhibits, collections and learning about chapters of America's past - often dark, often forgotten.

Ergo, to be witnessed.

There are gruesome photos of teenager Emmett Till's destroyed face after he was beaten beyond recognition by white men in Mississippi who thought he committed the unpardonable sin of flirting with a white woman. (His mother insisted on an open casket so that the world might see.) Photos of lynchings are worse are also to be beheld, the most horrifying of which has a black man strung up, his head all but detached from his body, with the words ""This n***** voted"" written on his shirt.

Less graphic, but no less sad, recreations here show lunch counters such as the one in Greensboro, North Carolina, where ""sit-ins"" were staged at ""whites only"" businesses. There's also a mockup of a bus like the one in Montgomery, Alabama, where Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white man and was subsequently arrested.

The museum also has paeans to hope, personified in displays about such leaders as King, Stokeley Carmichael, Jesse Jackson and others. Plus a photo from the swearing-in of President Obama in 2009 on the Capitol steps.

You can also peer into room 306 of the Lorraine, where Dr. King stayed the night before his death. An eerie feeling crosses one's soul looking at the bed where he slept his last rest. A wreath adorns the balcony outside the room, where he was felled by a bullet.

There are also temporary exhibits, such as ""Enslaved,"" a photographic essay documenting modern slavery, and across the way from the motel is the Legacy Building, whose prize feature shows the window from where assassin James Earl Ray likely fired the fatal round. The displays tell of the hunt for Ray, who was eventually caught in London by an eagle-eyed customs agent who recognized a phony passport when he saw one. Ray was extradited back to the United States, where he was tried and convicted of Dr. King's murder, and died in prison in 1998 aged 70.

We have come so far, yet so much more needs to be done.

Soon it's time for me to pick up Tim for a little trip south of the border, for 80 miles southwest of Memphis is an unassuming 'burg in the Mississippi Delta called Clarksdale. It was here, legend posits, where Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads of Highway 49 and Highway 61 in order to become the world's greatest bluesman. I visited here a few years ago to research both ""The Crossroads"" for this publication as well to pop by Clarksdale's most famous business.

Ground Zero Blues Club (387 Delta Ave, Clarksdale, Mississippi, 38614, 662/621-9009) is more than a proving ground for local talent; rather, it's become a mandatory pilgrimage for the greats of music, from Robert Plant to Elvis Costello. Live music here is king, and co-owner Bill Luckett - who runs the joint with partners Howard Stovall and another Mississippian by the name of Morgan Freeman - maintains an active calendar and a dining menu to match.

Tim and I sit at a table near the front of the stage. Tonight's entertainment is Dark Water, a trio out of nearby Philadelphia, Mississippi. As the local boys start to rock out, Tim and I chow down on some deep-fried tamales, heaven on the palate,and which I pair with Southern Pecan English Brown Ale from Lazy Magnolia, the state's most prominent brewer. For main course I go in for a sandwich of pulled pork with a side of fried okra, which fills me within moments.

Other local craft beers on the Ground Zero menu include the Ghost River Golden Ale, which is outstanding, and the Mississippi Blues Trail Farmhouse Ale, which is not without its charms, but I preferred the Ghost River.

Bill Luckett pops by our table to say hello. He and Tim go way back, and the two gentlemen enjoy a ritual of balancing wine glasses on their heads that I am told has a story behind that is a great in-joke. Bill is extremely friendly and warm, and joins us for a round of drinks in between his various calendar appointments which, as the mayor of Clarksdale, keep him rather busy. As a longtime state politician, Bill agrees to a lengthy sit-down interview with me for another story for this publication, which is forthcoming.

Tim and I enjoy our drinks and dessert of deep-fried Snickers, which is indulgence par excellence. I spend some time rocking out on the dance floor and chatting it up with Dark Water drummer Matthew Mason, whose upcoming album will also see some light in these pages.

As is tradition, I sign the wall in a place near the back of the joint, so I can return another day to find it - and sign it again.

After the show, Tim and I head down the street to pay homage to the Crossroads. I was here a year-and-a-half ago, under much different circumstances and with much different company. I was a bit worried about returning here due to said earlier memories, but that was another time. And tonight, as the crossed guitars are lit up to mark the spot where the legend of Robert Johnson and the devil began, I can't help but be reminded that this day, this weekend, I have made new memories in Memphis and Mississippi to sit next to - as oppose to neutralize - those old ones.

All of it underlined by the music that was born here.

Everyone I have met this weekend has invited me to return again soon. And so I shall, to find more adventures.

The adoption of autonomous vehicles will reduce personal car ownership and the need for parking garages.

The adoption of autonomous vehicles will reduce personal car...

City leaders in Des Moines, Iowa, are among leaders in several cities across the nation that are rethinking the future of parking downtown. ""They're saying, 'Don't build parking lots, don't build garages, you aren't going to need them,'"" said Councilman Skip Moore, citing city planners at national conferences across the country. And Altamonte Springs, Fla., solves its ""last mile"" problem, connecting popular destinations with public transit, by subsidizing Uber rides. It's cheaper than building more parking garages.

The costs are even higher in the Bay Area, where we could be housing people instead of housing cars. As urban planner Donald Shoup writes in his now-classic book, ""The High Cost of Free Parking,"" parking spaces in San Francisco cost more than $34,000 each to build (in 2011), and take up 330 square feet of space. That is about the space needed for an apartment micro-unit. In the housing-starved Bay Area, that trade-off should be made explicit.

Parking standards are also under review in the planning bible that determines what will be built by real-estate developers in our state, the California Environmental Quality Act. CEQA assumes a predictable increase in car use when buildings go up, but the debate rages on around how much parking is adequate.

Those assumptions need to be completely re-thought in state and local discussions.

Three significant pressures are aligning that should give pause to investors in automobile parking garages. Garages are typically financed on a 30-year payback, either by cities or private investors. But they could find themselves holding the un-payable backend of a 30-year note, when folks stop driving within the next 15 years.

The first pressure , already evident, is from Millennials, who are simply not interested in driving . In part, this is based in the embracing of social media connectivity that makes connectivity via car unnecessary or burdensome. With fewer driver's licenses and auto purchases among young adults comes decreased need for that parking garage space.

The second pressure is the technological advancement toward autonomous vehicles. As these vehicles are converted into ""robot taxis,"" which can be hailed with a tap on a cell phone app, the need for ownership of personal cars will decline, taking with it the need for parking.

Automated mobility services could capture two-thirds of the entire U.S. mobility market by 2030. And given that currently private cars may need as many as four spaces , for the combined destinations involving home, work and shopping, the entire market for parking garages will take a drastic hit. The Smart Cities Council argues that current thinking by cities on the impact of autonomous cars does not take parking into account.

The third pressure has to do with what must happen, as the first pressure has to do with what people want, and the second with what is emerging. Every expert on climate change agrees that to avoid global meltdown we have to drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels . That is, we have to stop using gasoline-powered cars.

So, within the next 15 years, there will be more reliance on transport by foot, bicycle and public transit. There will be more on-demand autonomous electric vehicles, which will circulate among users and spend relatively little time parked. Consequently, the demand for public parking garages will plummet.

The least that cities and real estate developers should do if they feel they need to build parking garages would be to design structures that can be easily converted into commercial, residential or other uses.

But the better advice is: Don't build them, because they won't be needed. And adopt local regulations that require justifying new parking, especially in cities served by transit. Otherwise, we all will be stuck with the bill.

The night sky for the year 2017 busily begins with beautiful planets and shooting stars.

Venus and Marsloiter in the west-southwestern sky after sunset. The vibrant Venus, a spectacular beacon at -4.4 magnitude (very bright) gets more luminous toward January's end, and the dimmer, red Mars at 0.9 magnitude (bright) becomes slightly less bright.

The sliver of a young moon approaches Venus and Mars on Sunday - as the moon will be on Venus' side. On Monday, the slightly thicker moon hangs out between the two planets.

By mid-month, Venus and Mars appear closer by a few degrees in the west-southwestern sky after dusk and may need a cosmic chaperon to keep them apart. In the waning days of January, the far-less-bright Mars and the ebullient Venus are about 5 degrees away from each other.

Jupiter - hanging out near the star Spica in the constellation Virgo- rises in the east at about 1 a.m. now. In the middle of January, the big gassy planet rises just after midnight. At dawn now, it will be high in the south. Jupiter is conspicuous at -1.9 magnitude (quite bright) early in January and -2 magnitude late in the month.

The ringed Saturn rises just ahead of the rising sun by mid-month in the southeast, and the fleet Mercury makes a cameo appearance in the morning sky - also, just ahead of the sun in mid-month - in the east-southeast.

Shooting stars! The Quadrantid meteor showerpeaks on Tuesday morning, according to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The official peak occurs during morning daylight hours in the eastern United States, but devoted stargazers here may catch meteors in the hours before sunrise.

Generally, meteors occur when Earth passes through a dusty comet trail. For the Quadrantids,asteroid 2003 EH1(perhaps a comet, says Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory) probably forged the granular path.

The sun sets at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Jan. 4 here - that's the first 5 p.m. sunset we've seen since Nov. 7. Until Jan. 9, the sun rises here at 7:27 a.m., the latest sunrises of the year, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory.

2431848487,"Ramu Potarazu, chief executive of Binary Fountain, is among several leading Washington-area business leaders to offer their predictions for 2017. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) By Thomas Heath Reporter January 1 at 10:13 PM Follow @addedvalueth I asked several business executives, entrepreneurs, academics and technocrats - many of whom I have written about - to send their predictions for the Washington region's economy in 2017.

For the most part, they are optimistic, insightful and surprising. Not surprising is that the notorious gridlock on the region's roads - no, not the version on Capitol Hill - continues to be one of the Mid-Atlantic's most nettlesome problems. Predictions ventured into sports, politics, food and entertainment, and national affairs. Here are the responses, edited for content and length:

Raul Fernandez, private investor and vice chairman of Monumental Sports & Entertainment:

●Mars colonization or a similar moonshot will emerge as a big regional industry.

●The scale of the war in cybersecurity will begin to approach the size of the war on terror.

●The U.S. government will undergo rapid change not seen since the Manhattan Project and the space race, spurring private-sector growth.

●Shame, blame and the Twitter pulpit are new catalysts for change, replacing traditional rules of engagement.

●New local technology and cyber rock stars will be created by a federal government embracing lightning-fast decision-making similar to that of the private sector.

●Former president Barack Obama will become a vocal cheerleader for entrepreneurship, something all lifelong public servants will discover.

●And by 2021, the Capitals and Wizards will host championship games at Verizon Center.

April Young, managing director at Hercules Capital, a publicly traded venture debt firm with offices in Georgetown:

●Cybersecurity and protection of data and trade secrets will continue to be huge in the Washington region. It will shift from its primary focus on financial vulnerability to political and policy.

●There will be big opportunities around who goes and who stays this year among lobbyists, think-tank leadership and association executives based on perceived areas of risk and influence.

Ralph Terkowitz, former chief technology officer of The Washington Post and a partner at ABS Capital Partners, a Washington/Baltimore-area growth equity firm. Terkowitz hosts ""TerkTech"" dinners at which local technocrats, business executives and policymakers share ideas:

●D.C. emerges as a major hub for cyberservices.

●At least one company run by former MicroStrategy executives has a major exit.

●Online education re-blooms, and D.C. continues to be a thought leader in the field.

Brad Dockser, co-founder and chief executive of Bethesda-based Green Generation Solutions, a global firm that helps buildings lower energy costs:

●Metro becomes the best transit system in the United States as the SafeTrack program concludes, local governments agree on a new governance structure and the last link to Washington Dulles International Airport is completed.

●High-end residential prices in Northwest Washington will increase as Republicans move in and Democrats stay.

●Every good restaurant in Washington will have kimchi.

●Every embassy in Washington will host an event at the Trump International Hotel.

Mei Xu, chief executive and co-founder of Rockville-based Chesapeake Bay Candle company:

●Northern Virginia and Maryland will see job growth from increased governmental defense spending and a cybersecurity focus.

●Lifestyle centers combining office, grocery, condos, art, performances, independent retail and restaurant businesses will continue to grow after decades of being squeezed by big retail chains.

●Traffic will continue to be a problem, and policymakers will feel the pressure to create public transportation solutions. Road congestion will push gentrification in Washington and its immediate suburbs. Rosslyn, Va., and Bethesda, Md., will see prices rise, while homeowners farther out in Virginia - Potomac, McLean - will see demand soften.

●Income discrepancy between the mostly African American population of D.C. and new ""lifestyle centers"" will challenge policymakers.

Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a D.C. investment firm:

●Implementation of President Trump's major policy proposals slips into 2018.

●Economic growth for the Washington metropolitan area accelerates dramatically from the relatively low 1.3 percent for 2015 as billionaires descend upon the city and government spending grows.

●Washington real estate prices continue higher, construction expands and traffic worsens.

●Higher interest rates, a stronger dollar and a rebound in energy prices will limit meaningful acceleration in U.S. economic growth.

●Trump underestimates the disruptions caused by motorcades. Washington traffic gets worse, and gridlock remains the norm.

●Former Maryland men's basketball coach Gary Williams and ESPN television host Tony Kornheiser announce their foray into the Washington restaurant business. Keep your eye on Chad's in Northwest D.C.

Reena Aggarwal, Robert E. McDonough professor of finance at Georgetown University:

●A pickup in economic growth nationally will mean higher economic growth and more jobs for the Washington region.

●Washington-area firms will benefit greatly from increased private and governmental investment in cybersecurity.

●Investment in infrastructure could help the Washington region with long-term congestion and commuting.

Gabrielle Bosché, a consultant who advises companies on how to hire and sell to millennials:

●More industry underdogs will come on the scene with smarter social-media campaigns and witty marketing.

●The corner store makes a global splash with online shopping and Etsy-like accessibility.

●Millennial consumers will begin to make larger purchases.

Ramu Potarazu, chief executive of Binary Fountain, a company based in McLean, Va., that allows health-care providers to understand patients' experiences:

●Cybersecurity companies will be the fastest-growing companies in the local area because of their proximity to the FBI, CIA and NSA.

●The Dow Jones industrial average will surpass 22,000.

●Trump's approval ratings will surpass 50 percent.

●2017 is Bryce Harper's last year in a Nationals uniform.

2431849548,"The NFL is Gary Kubiak 's life. He refused to let it be the death of him.

""You can't kill yourself over this game,"" Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said Sunday. ""You don't want to die being a coach. You don't want to die like that.""

Saying goodbye to a job and team he loves was painful, as uncomfortable as the arms crossed across Kubiak's chest, as if his heart might burst, after the Broncos beat Oakland 24-6. In his heart, however, Kubiak knew he had to say goodbye, because as much as he loves the Broncos, he loves his wife and family more.

The team was never the same from the moment Kubiak was hauled away from the stadium in an ambulance after a loss to Atlanta in October. He suffered a mini-stroke while coach of the Texans in 2013, and the second health scare was too much to bear. He wore the stress in his face, yet refused to quit until this 9-7 season was done.

Related Articles December 25, 2016 Kiszla: Broncos must say goodbye to Trevor Siemian and hello to Paxton Lynch December 24, 2016 Kiszla: On K.C. sideline, there's round man in red coat ready to give Broncos a nice Christmas gift December 23, 2016 Kickin' It with Kiz: Will Trevor Siemian go down in Broncos history alongside Kyle Orton and Tim Tebow? December 22, 2016 Kiszla: Patrick Roy has left building, and Avs exec Joe Sakic should be next out the door December 21, 2016 Kiszla: Think Aqib Talib would have had guts to tell Peyton Manning to shut up?

""In all honesty, I struggled this year,"" admitted Kubiak, holding back tears.

Broncos Country, however, should not be ashamed to shed a tear. Watching Kubiak walk away from a team where he has devoted half his 55 years as a quarterback, offensive coordinator or head coach felt like the end of an era.

So raise a glass and toast a magnificent six-season run, a return to glory that began when John Elway returned to the franchise in 2011. The Broncos shoved their way past New England and Dallas as America's team, with Peyton Manning as quarterback. It was a celebration as loud as a million Colorado voices cheering when the Broncos returned home with the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Super Bowl 50.

The party, however, never lasts forever. So on the first day of 2017, it felt like road's end. Before Kubiak walked off the field and disappeared in the tunnel with a humble wave, the crowd chanted his name. All day long, as news of the coach's imminent departure spread, shock and denial preceded the sadness of Kubiak's resignation. ""I was just in disbelief,"" Denver receiver Emmanuel Sanders said.

The Broncos need to be reborn. This is more than a re-tooling. This is a franchise in transition, with a transfer of power from longtime owner Pat Bowlen in need of resolution. It's fair to ask if Elway is committed to working with Mr. B's heir, because you can bet the Los Angeles Rams are wondering the same thing.

More positive: Hear the heavy sigh from Buffalo to Los Angeles, in every NFL city in need of a coach? Denver is suddenly the best coaching gig available in the league. The Broncos figure to have roughly $40 million in cap space to remake the offensive line, refortify their defensive interior and maybe chase a veteran quarterback.

Kyle Shanahan, son of the mastermind and current offensive coordinator of the high-scoring Atlanta Falcons , represents the juiciest candidate, offering a plot twist that's positively Shakespearean. He is 37 years old now, but I can still see him as a skinny teenager, standing in the back of a postgame news press conference , a silent apprentice taking notes as his father explained the X's and O's of a win or loss.

But is the younger Shanahan the best man for the job or the best fit with Elway? The bond between Elway and Kubiak was forged over a generation, born of falling asleep as Broncos roommates on the road, as black-and-white reruns of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" flickered on the hotel-room television.

Coaching the Broncos is not kid's play, as we discovered the hard way with Josh McDaniels. Elway needs to cast a wide net. Explore a trade with the New Orleans Saints for Sean Payton? That's not a bad idea. But I would start with a call to Stanford. David Shaw is the real deal, and he would only consider leaving the Cardinal for an elite NFL team with a championship mindset.

""We're not that far off,"" Harris insisted. ""The last time we had a coaching change, it gave us the extra juice and we won the Super Bowl.""

Look out world! The Broncos will be back! But the feisty optimism of Harris does not make it true.

Fresh eyes and honest analysis are welcome on almost every aspect of the team. Is gambling on the health of linebacker DeMarcus Ware really worth the risk? Could Sanders or cornerback Aqib Talib have the most value to the Broncos as trade bait? Is quarterback Trevor Siemian more like Kyle Orton or Jake Plummer? And did rookie Paxton Lynch learn that talent without focus won't cut it in the NFL?

Please indulge me one personal observation. I hung out for a day with Kubiak in his modest apartment on the edge of town in 1983, when he was a rookie quarterback and I was a cub reporter. In more 33 years of covering sports in Colorado, Kubiak leading the Broncos to a championship is the best coaching job I have ever covered.

Let the healing for the Broncos begin. First, let us all pray: Get well and stay well, Mr. Kubiak.

2431857129,"Catholic cardinals apparently deserve a break today - and now they can get one at a controversial McDonald's that has opened a football field length's away from the Vatican.

The McDonald's opened Friday in a Vatican-owned building in the Pio Borgo district of Rome, about 100 yards from the Vatican State, . NPR's Rome correspondent, Sylvia Poggioli, tweeted a picture of the restaurant Saturday.

The opening was low-key, reflecting widespread opposition that broke out when plans for the restaurant - quickly dubbed ""McVatican"" - were made public in October. McDonald's made no announcement, and the opening wasn't noted in the official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.

Only a new golden arches icon pinned to McDonald's Italia's online map betrays its existence. (The McVatican is open from 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week, the listing notes helpfully. Wi-Fi is available.)

The national newspaper La Repubblica reported that McDonald's will pay the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See - basically, the Vatican's property supervisor - more than $30,000 a month for the bottom floor of the building.

But Cardinal Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, told the newspaper at the time that the decision to rent the fast food chain almost 5,800 square feet of restaurant space was ""aberrant"" and ""a perversion.""

Two other McDonald's are also within a stone's throw of the Vatican - one only a few hundred yards from the Vatican Museum and another about 200 yards away at Viale Giulio Cesare. (And there's a Burger King roughly halfway between them.)

What makes the McVatican so controversial, however, is that it's on actual Vatican property. Not only that, but it occupies the bottom floor of a building that is also home to several senior cardinals - among them Gerhard Ludwig Müller, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office responsible for overseeing church orthodoxy.

Sgreccia told La Repubblica that no price is high enough to justify the ""disgrace"" of selling ""unhealthy"" food ""that I would never eat"" in such a place.

""I repeat, selling mega-sandwiches in Borgo Pio is a disgrace,"" he said. The rent money could better be used to help ""the area's needy ... and suffering, as the Holy Father teaches,"" he said.

If you spend enough time in this space, you begin to realize that what Justin Carder - the man who opened E.M. Wolfman General Interest Small Bookstore three years ago in February - is really dealing in is not so much books as it is connections.

In the few years it's been open, E.M. Wolfman has become a cultural center in downtown Oakland, a place where people might shop for books during the day, but where at night they read poetry, play music, exchange ideas and look at art. It's a place where a small publishing house was born, where a film screening series on black independent cinema took root and where several artists have shown their work for the first time.

On more than a few occasions, somebody has come in and seen the space and turned to Carder, eyes wide. ""I've always dreamed of having a bookstore,"" they say (or some variation thereof). But that was never his dream. ""The dream is to have a space to gather people together.""

The dream, in fact, started off a bit nebulously. It was early January 2014; Carder had just moved back to Oakland, a place he'd lived on and off for the better part of a decade; and he was feeling disconnected. ""I just had a moment where I was like, 'I need to start something. I need to do something that's a little bit bigger than I can handle,'"" he says.

Carder is fast-talking, free-associating and earnest. He speaks in starts and stops, and you get the feeling that has something to do with the sheer number of ideas running through his head in any given moment. He'd come up in punk houses in Oakland, going to underground shows and DIY-style events. At one point, he ran a music venue out of a house.

This is all to say that he knew the value of alternative scenes and the venues in which they thrived. He knew how precarious those spaces were, how quickly they could be lost. And he also knew they could be insular (""you had to know someone or be somewhere"") and homogenous (""it was a very white scene in racially diverse Oakland"").

He turned over ideas in his head, ways to connect the communities he missed to a physical space. Maybe he'd try an art gallery. Maybe some sort of odds-and-ends shop. ""I didn't really know what I wanted do."" But then, one day, while he was waiting in line at a thrift shop, a tower of books balanced in his hands, he started to see a store lined with them.

Books, he figured, were fairly accessible. A new and used bookstore could be the sort of space ""where all types of people feel at least relatively comfortable entering into.""

After that spark of an idea, everything happened quickly. By February - after pleading with the landlord - he secured a lease on a space that had been dark for nearly two years. He took a free class in Berkeley to figure out how to run a business. He set up bank accounts and applied for a business license. It was all almost too much. Exactly as he'd hoped.

But all of that was mostly in service to the physical space. The real work came in other ways.

One day, for instance, he turned to Meagan Day, a journalist who works for Mother Jones magazine whom he'd known for some years and who had been making frequent stops by the store. If she could write a book about anything, what would she write about?

About a year later, they published her book ""Maximum Daylight"" under the Wolfman Books label. In it, Day tells the stories of the people who call Tonopah, a small town in Nevada, home. It might have been a magazine piece one day, she says, but it absolutely would not have been a book without Carder's question and then his help with the follow-through.

One night in December 2015, Carder held a release party for the book. Day read to a packed house while her partner's photographs, which appear in the book, hung on the walls. A friend who'd written an album to accompany the book performed some of his music. So many connections from one simple question.

And Day is just one example. Carder has spent the past three years urging artists to show their work in the gallery he set up in the back of the store; he's encouraged people to pitch ideas and projects; he's connected many strangers who have happened to pass through the store. ""So many of the artists and people who have shown work here, people who have their books here, just walked in the door,"" Carder says.

Carder has also established an artist-in-residency position. The program is flexible and adjusts to fit whoever happens to be doing it at the moment, but essentially, Carder offers up help (whether it's editing or publicity or design), space in the bookstore and now, thanks to a grant from from Southern Exposure, a small stipend.

Ryanaustin Dennis, the most recent artist in residence, had been wanting to start a series of film screenings centered on black independent cinema. So he pitched it, and Carder said yes. Like that, the Black Aesthetic Film Series happened. Dennis is already planning a second season, which will start in February.

""It's like an artistic hub,"" Dennis says about the store. ""I think this space facilitates a lot of growth.""

Christian Johnson is next up. He's planning to create a short film - an art-house thriller - that examines ""white liberalism and the liberal bourgeoisie"" in Oakland. The film would have happened eventually, he says, but there's no denying that E.M. Wolfman has become his ""artistic home.""

""Justin is just really a champion of community work and art,"" Johnson says. ""It's really empowering to have somebody like him stand with you.""

Nearly three years in, E.M. Wolfman is becoming the sort of space Carder imagined in those early days. But he's nowhere near finished with the project. ""There's always a list of 100 things I want to do."" He wants the calendar packed, something happening in the space every day of the week.

""Well,"" he says, ""we'll just keep going.""

You don't have to walk from Mexico to Oregon to appreciate the California Coastal Trail, but Morgan Visalli and Jocelyn Enevoldsen did anyway. The young marine scientists spent three months last summer exploring a proposed 1,200-mile route that many consider a symbol of California's approach to managing its coastline.

A short stroll across scenic bluffs, shifting dunes or sandy beaches is equally worthy of protection, says Tim Duff, a project manager with the California State Coastal Conservancy, the state agency in Oakland that serves as primary architect of the trail.

""Public access is not just a north-south coastal trail - it's all of the spur trails off of that,"" Duff said. ""The goal of the conservancy is to maximize public access to the coast. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to get to the coast.""

Many Californians take this level of access for granted. But 40 years ago, during the flurry of environmental legislation that also gave Americans the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species acts, it was an edgy idea amid a wave of coastal development and privatization.

The California Coastal Act of 1976 reserved for the public all land below the mean high-tide mark, and required local jurisdictions to identify an alignment for a contiguous trail that would run from one end of the state to the other.

More broadly, it outlined the philosophy of land management that is still shaping California's coastal policy 40 years later. That philosophy was built on the twin pillars of regulation and promotion, and implemented by two discrete agencies.

The better-known of these is the California Coastal Commission, a regulatory body empowered to say no to development - occasionally resulting in newsworthy fines and lawsuits. The California State Coastal Conservancy, on the other hand, is an executive body supporting environmental restoration and public access.

Visitors along the California Coastal Trail above Baker Beach in...

Over the past four decades, the California State Coastal Conservancy, whose seven directors are appointed by the governor and state Legislature, has quietly invested more than $2 billion in public funds and leveraged another $3.5 billion in investments. Its portfolio includes more than 1,600 completed projects and 400,000 acres of land that has been conserved for habitat and recreation.

""One agency keeps things out and another brings things in,"" said Coastal Commissioner and San Diego County Supervisor Greg Cox. The authors of the 1976 coastal act, he said, ""made sure we had not only the stick but also the carrot.""

Only with these two entities working together, Cox says, could the state produce something as ambitious as the California Coastal Trail. Its proposed route runs through more than 100 different jurisdictions along some of the planet's most valuable land.

Yet despite all that the trail represents, the coastal trail - with about only about one-third of its length completed with signage - still lacks the name recognition of a Pacific Crest or Appalachian trail. Its low profile parallels that of its closest patron.

Visalli and Enevoldsen say they were motivated to hike the route by more than a desire to celebrate the grandeur and variety of California's coast. They also sought to call attention to the trail itself.

In its current state, the often-unmarked route flits from beach to bluff to highway shoulder and back: evidence that although simple in concept, the trail represents an incredibly complex endeavor. In the Bay Area, it can be found in state parks in Sonoma County, on the steep headlands of Marin County, in the Presidio and along Ocean Beach in San Francisco, and on oceanfront prairies in San Mateo County.

A 2003 state report said additional acquisition and construction to complete the trail was likely to cost at least $320 million. More recent figures are unavailable, but per-mile costs have surely increased. Much of the funding and work needed to expand the trail flows directly through the coastal conservancy.

""The conservancy has taken a big idea and made it a reality one piece as a time,"" said former Coastal Commission chairman and outgoing Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey. ""They have the perseverance and the persistence to see the big picture.""

That's true beyond the trail as well, he says. As the conservancy's budget and ambition have expanded over the years, so has its jurisdiction, which now reaches upstream into watersheds and sources of water that flow to the coast.

The coastal conservancy led the tidal wetlands restoration project that reclaimed 15,000 acres of former salt ponds in the South Bay.

The coastal conservancy led the tidal wetlands restoration project...

The agency has played a lead role in the largest tidal wetland restoration project on the West Coast, the reclaiming of 15,000 acres of former salt ponds in the South Bay. It was also a central player in the nation's largest beneficial reuse of dredged sediment - a project that delivered 6 million cubic yards of mud from the Port of Oakland to wetlands in the North Bay - and the largest dam removal in California history, the dismantling of San Clemente Dam on the Carmel River in the mountains above Big Sur.

And that's just in the last decade.

Sam Schuchat, executive officer of the conservancy since 2001, says the agency is both mandated and uniquely qualified to tackle such challenges.

""Our main tool is people skills,"" he said. ""That's the core competency we have, really. Certainly we have lots of technical expertise ... but that's how we're viewed as an agency: This is an agency that can make things happen.

""Having money is necessary,"" he said, ""but not sufficient.""

And public funding, despite amounting to $2 billion over the past four decades - including $1 billion in the 2000s alone - also represents the agency's core vulnerability.

The conservancy has never had a single, sustained source of funds. It is now chewing its way through $100 million in competitive grant funding from Proposition 1, the 2014 state water bond worth $7.5 billion. By 2018 it will be on the lookout for more. If none comes, Schuchat said, ""2020 is when we start running on fumes.""

That has happened before, in the relatively lean 1990s. ""There is interest in continuing to fund natural resources with bond money,"" Schuchat said. ""Whether that will come to pass in time for the 2018 election is very hard to predict.""

Schuchat says he's also unsure of the agency's immediate prospects at the federal level, where typically 10 to 15 percent of its administrative budget originates. ""My assumption is that this administration (of President-elect Donald Trump) is not going to be very friendly to conservation generally,"" Schuchat said.

Regardless, work on the coastal trail will continue. Visalli and Enevoldsen say they hope to help by sharing insights gleaned from their 96 days walking the route. In a recent presentation to the conservancy board, they advocated for improvements to signage and access, safer highway sections where necessary, and the development of an online map, which doesn't yet exist.

""Building the California Coastal Trail is the conservancy's Goal 1A, so it's time for a digital map,"" Enevoldsen said. ""Being able to hike the full length of the coastal trail gives you an appreciation of the scale of beauty, open space and sacred places that we have in this state.""

Coastal Commission member resigns

Wendy Mitchell, a member of the California Coastal Commission who supported the controversial ouster of the agency's executive director last year, has resigned.

The Los Angeles Times reported Mitchell sent a resignation letter Friday to Gov. Jerry Brown, saying she would step down immediately after six years on the powerful panel.

Mitchell, a government affairs consultant and former legislative aide, was one of seven of the 12 voting commissioners who voted in February to fire Executive Director Charles Lester, a 24-year veteran of the agency.

Mitchell and other panel members accused him of unspecified management issues and leadership problems. They declined to comment in detail because personnel matters are confidential.

2431887923,"On a clear New Year's Day so warm it fooled the bees into waking and mingling with the crowds, an estimated 400 people flocked into Mother Neff State Park for its sixth annual First Day Hike, a nationwide tradition celebrating the start of a new year.

Jeremy Gann, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department peace officer and interpreter, said at the start of a 2 p.m. trek that 174 people had taken a 9 a.m. hike, braving chilly temperatures and a brief shower.

More than 200 more came in the afternoon to choose between two guided tours, one a 3.5-mile walk that explored hills, cave entrances and other attractions, and the other a 1.5 mile route that covered rolling prairie land with one scenic overlook.

Many other people were at campsites and on the trails without the guides assigned to the First-Day Hike.

The attendance was about double the total of 208 who appeared on New Year's Day 2016, a cold and blustery day that had some visitors seeking shelter.

Gann said park officials were hoping the First Day Hike at Mother Neff, the first state park to be established in Texas, would be the best attended among the 17 state parks in the local region. It was second behind Inks Lake State Park last year.

""The people around here are really supportive of our park,"" he said. ""We're a lot smaller than Inks, but we're really popular.""

John and Mary Odom, of Harker Heights, were on their first New Year's Day hike in the park but said they had helped to blaze the trails the hike featured.

""Years ago, we showed up to volunteer, and a man handed me a chain saw and pointed in this direction and said, 'Go after it.' And I went.""

Old World custom

Jennifer Mashburn, of Washington, D.C., had spent a week traveling around Texas with friends. She said the First Day Hike reminded her of an Old World custom in North Carolina in which descendants of Scottish immigrants spend New Year's Day walking the perimeters of their lands.

An Ohio native, she said, ""I'm not sure of the details of the custom, but I wonder if it inspired the First Day Hike.""

Jamie Harman, given the indoor job of office manager for the park despite being a park ranger, was leading the group on the 1.5-mile hike.

""This is one day they let me out of the office,"" she said.

Sweeping her hand toward foot-high brown grass that shares space with cedars all over the prairie land, she said, ""If you come back in the spring, you'll see this land covered with flowers. We're currently in a project to restore the original prairie grasses. As this progresses, the wildflowers will become richer and richer.""

Pat M. Neff, Texas governor in the 1920s, created the Texas State Parks Board and made six acres of land donated for community use in 1921 by his mother, Isabella Eleanor Neff, the first state park.

The Civilian Conservation Corps started developing the land in the 1930s with a stone tabernacle and recreation hall that are still in use.

With other amenities added through the decades, the spot draws people for picnicking, hiking and fishing.

The park borders the Leon River on State Highway 236 west of Moody.

Amazon is eyeing old goods and the space of reselling those products as it works on expanding its ecommerce business in India.

Amazon has launched its "" Sell as Individual "" service in India, allowing users to sell their used goods. The pilot program is currently operational in Bangalore.

Though still in the early phase, the move should worry Ebay, Quikr and Olx, some popular platforms in the space that allow individuals to sell their used products.

On its website, Amazon explains that people in Bangalore can list the products they want to sell and the company would handle the packaging and delivery of the product.

The products will be listed on the website, and when someone places an order for it, a representative from Amazon India would visit the seller and collect the product from their doorstep at their preferred time.

Image: screengrab / amazon india

Amazon says it will charge the sellers Rs 10 (15 cents) for every item they sell below Rs 1,000 ($15), Rs 50 (75 cents) for every item, sold between 1,000 to Rs 5,000 ($75), and Rs 100 ($1.5) if the item sold costs more than Rs 5,000.

Amazon has been experimenting in the space of old goods for quite some time. In June 2015, its Junglee website had launched a pilot service to allow users to sell their old products. Amazon launched Junglee in 2012 with an aim to help customers find and discover products from online and offline shops.

For Amazon, having individuals sell their old products could be a big market opportunity, and yet another way to differentiate from Flipkart, its arch rival in the country.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - The South Carolina 2018 governor's race was supposed to be wide open, with the departure of popular Republican Nikki Haley, term-limited from seeking a third run. Now, with Haley's potential early departure pending her confirmation as U.N. ambassador, a space has been created for current Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster - who will step in if Haley's confirmed - to run as an incumbent next year.

The Democratic side remains clear, with a few names tossed around but no candidate commitments. But with the state's politics trending more and more conservative over the past decade or more, attention is focused on the potential pool of candidates who will vie for the Republican nomination. McMaster is getting a lot of attention, but will he get some GOP company on primary ballots?

___

THE INCUMBENT

McMaster, 69, is a veteran of politics, both as a candidate but also a party leader helping shape the process. Serving as U.S. Attorney under President Ronald Reagan, McMaster also led South Carolina's GOP and was the state's attorney general for eight years.

He sought the state's office in 2010, when he finished third in a four-way Republican primary ultimately won by Haley. He backed Haley and led her transition efforts, as well as an ethics committee she created to make reform recommendations.

Haley was re-elected in 2014, and McMaster was elected separately as lieutenant governor. Starting in 2018, governor and lieutenant governor will be elected on the same ticket, so McMaster could have the opportunity to pick his No. 2.

A member of South Carolina's GOP establishment, McMaster went outside those boundaries early last year when he became the nation's first statewide officeholder to back Donald Trump for president. The move stunned political observers, but McMaster's support never wavered, despite Democrats' calls to withdraw it.

The move has now seemingly paid off, with Trump's nomination of Haley clearing McMaster's pathway to the governor's office, a post he's always wanted.

He's said little so far about what he'll do as governor, but McMaster has told The Associated Press in several interviews since Trump's election he'll do whatever he can to support the new president on the state's behalf.

___

THE OUTSIDER

Although she's never sought elected office, Catherine Templeton is no stranger to politics. The labor lawyer and union-fighting specialist was mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. labor secretary after she was summoned to Trump Tower for a meeting with the president-elect.

Templeton has earned a reputation in South Carolina for having a no-nonsense approach to getting things done. She ran the state's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation early in Haley's first term, cutting out redundancies and streamlining the agency. Haley played up Templeton's union-fighting background and ability to keep unions out of the new Boeing Inc. assembly plant in North Charleston. After a lawsuit over comments Haley made about the duo's ability to ""fight the unions"" at Boeing, the International Association of Machinists ultimately canceled a vote to certify the union.

Templeton served Haley a second time, directing South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, the state's largest agency. As Ebola concerns swirled in late 2014, Templeton said her agency needed the ability to send simultaneous health alerts to hospitals on the front lines of identifying a potential outbreak. The director herself even tested the state's abilities, showing up at two Charleston hospitals and said she was suffering from the flu, in an attempt to see if hospitals were really ready to tackle identifying an unknown outbreak.

Templeton has said she's exploring a gubernatorial bid but has made no official announcement.

___

THE PROSECUTOR

As a solicitor in the 1990s, Tommy Pope launched to nationwide fame for his case against Susan Smith, the Union County mother who killed her two sons by rolling her car into a lake. Pope pursued the death penalty against Smith, who was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.

Voters picked Pope to represent Rock Hill in the state House in 2010 and now, recently re-elected for a fourth term, he serves as House speaker pro tem. During last year's legislative session, Pope was chief sponsor of an ultimately successful ethics bill pushed by Haley.

Pope was the first Republican to officially say he'd run for governor after Haley's time was up, announcing in 2014 he'd make a run for the state's top slot. Pope's biggest challenge, if he sticks with the bid, will be to boost his name recognition across the state.

___

THE OTHERS

Many other Republicans have already been mentioned as potential 2018 gubernatorial hopefuls, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and state Sen. Tom Davis, a libertarian-leaning state senator recently elected to a third term representing some of South Carolina's coastal areas.

Yancey McGill, who briefly served as lieutenant governor, has previously said he'll run next year. Tim Scott, a widely popular black Republican who just won his first full term in the U.S. Senate, recently said he hasn't ruled out a bid. U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney had been considered a potential candidate until his recent nomination to serve as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget.

As for the Democrats, the only apparent certainty is that two-time nominee Vincent Sheheen won't be making a third gubernatorial bid. State lawmakers Brad Hutto and James Smith are often mentioned as potential candidates, although neither has committed to running.

2431929130,"Samsung has already concluded its investigations and already knows what made its ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 explosive. It has already shared its findings with independent labs and is expected to share those results with the rest of the world soon, probably this month even. And yet, in an industry notorious for leakS, there how been very little info about that data and Samsung is exercising extreme caution with leaks. That may be because, according to industry sources, the root cause of the Galaxy Note 7's problem isn't simply a battery issue, contrary to what Samsung kept on insisting months ago.

When the Galaxy Note 7 started burning up, Samsung's very quick investigation pointed the finger at a small and rare manufacturing defect with the battery. Samsung's own Samsung SDI business quickly became the scapegoat of that fiasco. That conclusion, however, was quickly debunked when other Galaxy Note 7's, those using batteries from Chinese ATL, started catching fire too.

There has been some controversy regarding how Samsung carried out its first internal investigation, with insiders claiming that Samsung jumped the gun too soon just to keep the Galaxy Note 7 in the market longer. That might, indeed, be the case as the official, and hopefully final, report is speculated to reveal. And, no, it's not just a simple battery problem.

While the battery is of course, involved, since it is the primary combustible component in any phone, it wasn't to blame alone. Instead, it could be a combination of parts swelling up due to overcharging as well as insufficient heat dissipation. The latter is a common phenomenon when cramming high performance hardware in a cramped space like the very thing Galaxy Note 7.

Although it already has the results of the investigation, Samsung strongly admonished its employees to prevent any form of leakage. It fears that premature revelation could hurt its chances of saving face with the Galaxy S8. If anything more than just the battery is to be revealed as the incendiary cause, Samsung might have to cut back on features for this year's flagship, which, in turn, could hurt Samsung's profits even more.

(Carl Bruce Photography) Finding an affordable place to live sometimes requires a few compromises, such as switching from a single-family house to a townhouse or moving a little farther from the city limits.

This week's affordable house is a brick-front townhouse in the McNair Farms development in Herndon. The three-level townhouse at 2428 Corn Crib Ct. has 1,700 square feet of living space with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. Priced at $387,000, the residence also requires a $105 monthly homeowner association fee. Annual taxes are $3,784.

Built in 1997, the townhouse has been upgraded with newly installed hardwood flooring, carpeting, mirrors, blinds and light fixtures. The kitchen has ceramic-tile flooring, granite counters, a center island, upgraded 42-inch cabinets and new appliances. The family room has a gas fireplace, and the residence includes two assigned parking spaces and a fenced yard with a storage shed. The development has a swimming pool, and the homeowner's fee pays for trash removal and front lawn care. ] The townhouse is close to a Metro bus stop and is a 10-minute drive to the Reston Silver Line Metro station. Shops and restaurants are nearby.

Shuttle: Challenger 
Launch: 30 August 1983 
Mission duration: 6 days 
Launchpad: 39A Kennedy Space Center 
Landing: Edwards AFB ........ STS-8 was the eighth Space Shuttle mission and the third flight of Challenger. It conducting the first night launch and night landing of the Space Shuttle program.
It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully 
achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery 
that a solid-fuel rocket booster had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.
The mission's primary payload was INSAT-1B, an Indian communications and weather 
observation satellite, which was released by the orbiter and boosted into a geostationary 
orbit. 
The secondary payload, replacing a delayed NASA communications satellite, was a four-
metric-ton dummy payload, intended to test the use of the shuttle's ""Canadarm"" remote 
manipulator system. Scientific experiments carried onboard Challenger included the 
environmental testing of new hardware and materials designed for future spacecraft, the 
study of biological materials in electric fields under microgravity, and research into space

2431954330,"After three long years' wait, 'Sherlock' strode back onto our screens last night - and if Benedict Cumberbatch's skin looked a little more polished than when he made his pre-superstar Holmes debut, much was reassuringly the same about his interactions with John Watson, Mrs Hudson and, of course, his supercilious sibling Mycroft.

SPOILERS BELOW! DO NOT READ BEFORE VIEWING...

It wasn't all fun and mysteries. At the heart of this weekend's emotional return was the deconstruction of Mary Watson, Amanda Abbington putting in a spirited performance as the super agent turned happy mother, whose past caught up with her, despite Sherlock's efforts. , John let out a feral groan of grief, and even the emotion-free Sherlock looked appropriately shattered.

With all this going on, what was there to enjoy? Well...

One of the things this show does best has become almost incidental to the central storyline, however, Sherlock's effortless sleuthing was on fine display as he solved the mystery of the Welsborough son in the car. It was as ingenious as ever, and nicely tuned us up for the mysteries to follow.

The first big plot twist of the night - the revelation of the Thatchers, or rather what was in them - Mary's USB drive that we had thought long since lost.

The Bond-inspired fight in the kitchen and swimming pool, where Sherlock proved his fighting chops. All the gadgetry in the house was aesthetically pleasing too. The production designers have clearly been watching their share of Nordic Noir.

That intense scene between Sherlock and Mary, up to and including her getting the better of him with the drugged letter, only moments after he'd reminded her of his vow to protect her family - a game of equals.

Ahh, but... Mary's departure - faked passports, disguises and all - all the way into some casbah, where she walked slap bang into... Sherlock and John, courtesy of a bugged memory stick. One of the best things Moffat and Gatiss do is debunk high drama with a droll, mundane line.

The crisp, acerbic scenes between Sherlock and Mycroft, including the exchange of favours - Sherlock agreeing to pursue Moriarty, Mycroft agreeing to dig into AGRA and AMMO. The mutual contempt, and mutual dependence, is as clear as ever.

That makeup scene between John and Mary - ""you've always been a good man"" - made all the more poignant by the knowledge of actors and long-time couple Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington splitting before production. And that was before their intense finale that sent fans for their hankies.

All the way through, the sense of a t puzzle being slowly, self-assuredly built. Even with the sub-plot of John's indiscretion, his phone beeped early on, and we only discovered he had his own share of secrets to match any of Mary's. If it took us so long to learn about 'Ex', what else haven't we spotted that the writers have gleefully put right in front of our eyes? Watch this space.

'Sherlock' continues next Sunday at 9pm on BBC One. Catch up on BBCiplayer.

2431972865,"Samsung is kickstarting 2017 with a refresh to its Galaxy A series lineup of smartphones.

The South Korean smartphone manufacturer today unveiled the new Galaxy A3, Galaxy A5, and Galaxy A7, stating that all of these mid-range and high-end smartphones now feature water and dust resistance. The three new handsets now also get the USB Type-C ports, hinting that the new connector port is finally becoming mainstream this year. They also get premium design with metal frame and 3D glass back, similar to what's found on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.

The 2017 editions of Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 also sport larger batteries with support for Fast Charging capability, another feature that was previously mostly common on flagship smartphones within Samsung. Both the handsets are also getting big upgrade on the selfie camera.

Starting with the Galaxy A7 (2017), the smartphone now sports a larger 5.7-inch Super AMOLED FHD (1920x1080 pixels) display. It is powered by a 1.9GHz octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM, and houses 32GB of internal storage which can be expanded using a microSD card.

The Galaxy A series is getting water and dust resistance capabilities, USB Type-C ports, and powerful selfie cameras.

The new Galaxy A7 should click better photos than its predecessor, now featuring 16-megapixel camera with aperture f/1.9 on both the rear and front. It is powered by a 3,600mAh battery (up from 2,900mAh in last year's Galaxy A7).

The Galaxy A5 (2017) sports a 5.2-inch FHD Super AMOLED display, and houses a 3,000mAh battery. The rest of the features are the same as the Galaxy A7 (2017).

The last in the pack, the Galaxy A3 (2017) sports a 4.7-inch HD (1280x720 pixels) Super AMOLED display, and is finally getting a fingerprint scanner.

It is powered by a 1.6GHz octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM, and has 16GB internal storage, and again, a microSD card slot for more space on the phone.

It rocks a 13-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front facing shooter, and a 2,350mAh battery. Though it's not getting support for Fast Charging, users planning to purchase this phone will be happy about the IP68 certification on the phone, much like the other two phones, meaning resistance to dust, rain, and sweat.

All the smartphones are running Android 6.0.1 software, and will be available in stores first in Russia early this month, and then trickle across the world eventually.

Wired Staff Culture Date of Publication: 01.02.17. 01.02.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The 10 Movies We're Most Looking Forward to in 2017 More Guardians! More Alien! More Star Wars! Next year is going to be a big one for movies-so big that it was kind of hard to condense our list of must-see flicks into something shorter than Anna Karenina. But we did it! Below are our picks for the movies we (hopefully) won't be able to take our eyes off of (figuratively) in 2017. Star Wars: Episode VIII Lining up to see this one is a no-brainer. But even more than being the next Star Wars saga film-and marking the return of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and all our other friends-it's Rian Johnson's Star Wars saga film. So for fans of Johnson's mind-bending films like Brick and Looper, this is a big deal. We doubt Episode VIII will have time travel or teenage detectives, but we can't wait to find out. -Angela Watercutter

Release Date: December 15 Wonder Woman First, let's get one thing out of the way: We're a little disappointed Suicide Squad helmer David Ayer is in line to direct the Harley Quinn spinoff Gotham City Sirens. But, on the other side of the DC universe, we're very glad Monster's Patty Jenkins is directing Wonder Woman's standalone film. Based on the footage that was shown this year at Comic-Con International, and the first full trailer, it looks like the kind of bullet-deflecting, lassoing good time we've come to expect from Diana Prince. If there's any justice in the world, this should be stellar. -Angela Watercutter

Ridley Scott is directing, and Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace are back reprising their roles from Prometheus, so this is worth a shot. (James Franco and Danny McBride are also mysteriously on the cast list. So there's that.) Also, the alien in the first poster (right) gave us chills-in all the best ways. -Angela Watercutter

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has been working through 2016 on developing components for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), making the isolated nation's claim that it was close to a test-launch plausible, international weapons experts said on Monday.

North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift-off, the experts said.

While Pyongyang is close to a test, it is likely to take some years to perfect the weapon.

Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or further.

North Korea's state media regularly threatens the United States with a nuclear strike, but before 2016 Pyongyang had been assumed to be a long way from being capable of doing so.

""The bottom line is Pyongyang is much further along in their missile development than most people realize,"" said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the U.S.-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California.

She said the North's test in April of a large liquid-fuel engine that could propel an ICBM was a major development.

""The liquid engine test was astounding,"" Hanham said.

""For years, we knew that North Korea had a Soviet R-27 missile engine design. They re-engineered the design of that engine to double its propulsion"".

North Korea has said it is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile but it claims to be able to miniaturize a nuclear device have never been independently verified.

The isolated nation has achieved this progress despite U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions for its nuclear tests and long-range rocket launches dating back to 2006. The sanctions ban arms trade and money flows that can fund the country's arms program.

North Korea has enough uranium for six bombs a year and much of what it needs for its nuclear and missile programs relies on Soviet-era design and technology. Labor is virtually free.

It can produce much of its missile parts domestically and invested heavily in its missile development infrastructure last year, funded by small arms sales and by taxing wealthy traders in its unofficial market economy.

PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE

Throughout the year, North Korean state media showed images of numerous missile component tests, some of which revealed close-up details of engines and heat shields designed to protect a rocket upon re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.

The propaganda offensive may have revealed some military secrets, but it may have also been a bid to silence outside analysts, many of whom had remained skeptical of the North's missile program.

""They're answering the public criticisms of U.S. experts,"" said Joshua Pollack, editor of the U.S.-based Non proliferation Review. ""A lot of people had questioned whether they had a working ICBM-class heat shield"".

""So they showed us"".

Despite the research, Pyongyang has experienced considerable difficulties getting its intermediate-range Musudan missile, designed to fly about 3,000 km (1,860 miles), off the ground. It succeeded just once in eight attempted launches last year.

North Korea has fired long-range rockets in the past, but has characterized those launches as peaceful and designed to put an object into space.

Still, the South Korean defense ministry believes the three-stage Kwangmyongsong rocket used by Pyongyang to put a satellite in space last February already has a potential range of 12,000 km (7,457 miles), if it were re-engineered.

Doing so would require mastering safer ""cold-launch"" technology, and perfecting the ability of a rocket to re-enter the earth's atmosphere without breaking up.

""North Korea is working hard to develop cold-launch technology and atmospheric re-entry but South Korea and the U.S. will have to assess further exactly which level of development they have reached,"" South Korean defense ministry official Roh Jae-cheon told a briefing on Monday.

North Korea began stepping up its missile development in March 2016, Roh said, but added that there were no ""unusual signs"" related to test preparations, according to the South Korean military.

That same month, Kim Jong Un was photographed looking at a small, ball-like object that North Korean state news agency KCNA said was a miniaturized nuclear warhead - the device North Korea would need to fulfill its ICBM threat.

""2016 marked the year North Korea truly ramped up their WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) program,"" Hanham at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey said.

""I think we're going to see a (ICBM) flight test in 2017"".

Interest in the Fashion Square Mall area in urban Orlando is heating up again, with an affiliate of South Florida developer and property manager Grover Corlew buying 21 office buildings nearby.

It's called Orlando Central Office Park, and the price was $50.35 million.

With 637,380 square feet of office space, which the firm says is 82 percent leased, the property includes 46 acres.

The area has seen renovations and additions at Fashion Square, a new apartment complex (Elan Audubon Park) and plans for more apartments.

""Orlando Central's submarket is undergoing a transformation as sites are being redeveloped in the immediate area,"" Grover Corlew partner Anuj Grover said. ""We are looking at improvements to the property in the short term with an eye on redevelopment over the next decade.

""The potential of Orlando Central is extraordinary.""

Grover Corlew pointed to plans for major new developments in the area, which is near Orlando's urban core, such as a new 151-room boutique hotel and arrival of Orchard Supply Hardware and Floor & Décor at Fashion Square, where a Sears store recently closed.

Grover Corlew will manage the property and Tower Realty will continue as the leasing agent. Chris Lee, lead broker with CBRE, represented G&C OC Investors, LLC with the project financing.

Lockheed contracts

The Pentagon has announced new funding of about $470 million, in two contract modifications, for the controversial F-35 Lightning II jet fighter, for sales to South Korea and for a trainer program.

Although work on the South Korea modification will be performed at Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas, systems for the F-35 are produced in Orlando. Lockheed's Orlando operations did receive a significant part of a smaller modification, $19.3 million for a deployable mission rehearsal trainer in support of the F-35.

Lockheed employs more than 7,000 people in Central Florida. Many thousands more have stock in the company.

The F-35's electro-optical targeting system is engineered in Orlando at the Missiles and Fire Control plant on Sand Lake Road, and the company's Orlando simulation and training division also has an ongoing $122 million deal to build other key support equipment for the much-criticized, next-generation stealth fighter.

President-elect Donald Trump created a small furor recently when he tweeted that he'd like to see an alternate plan for the F-35 fighter jet.

Trump tweeted that ""Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!""

Trump had also tweeted Dec. 12 about the F-35, which is a $1 trillion program and one of the biggest defense projects in history. The company's stock dropped about 5 percent (representing about $4 billion) after the Dec. 12 tweet, but has gained again in following days.

The government aims to have about 3,000 F-35s over the net 30 years.

One expert the Sentinel interviewed said the F-18 is not new, and not a stealth fighter, and updating it for stealth capability could be as expensive as the F-35 program.

7-Eleven land

A San Diego real estate firm bought the property and building of 10 local 7-Eleven stores.

Documents filed with local officials show commercial property landlord Realty Income spent $30.4 million this week on 7-Eleven gas-station and convenience-store sites in Orlando, Apopka, Ocoee and Kissimmee.

The properties range in value from $4.7 million for a site near Avalon Park to a $1.79 million site.

Along with the sale, 7-Eleven signed 15-year leases on the properties with the option for another 25 years of leases. Realty Income bought the properties through a subsidiary called MDC Coast 5 LLC.

A representative for Realty Income did not return a request for comment.

Realty Income is a major holder of real estate in 49 states, owning more than 4,700 properties worth about $13.2 billion, according to its website.

That includes 330 properties in Florida. Realty Income touts itself as a high dividend investment with tenants such as Circle K, LA Fitness and AMC Theaters.

Realty Incomes stock gained 1.5 percent in trading to end the year Friday, settling at $57.48. Its most recent monthly dividend was 20.25 cents a share.

2431991780,"Q: I can't get a refund from Amtrak for its totally inappropriate ""handicapped"" room on the Empire Builder from Chicago to Glacier National Park.

The room was not safe; there was no room for a wheelchair, no grab bars, and there were no safety bars on the toilet. There was no room for two people to sit and eat at the same time, and since my husband and I were downstairs and far from the dining car, this is where we had to have all meals.

Also, there were sharp metal protrusions that injured both my husband and me.

After almost three months, the only offer I got was a voucher on a future trip. This was after emails to the CEO, chief operating officer and my travel agent.

Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.

I would like at least a 50 percent refund. I can't travel on Amtrak again because the room was not safe or comfortable for my disabled husband. I would even accept a $500 check, but not a voucher for travel that I can't use.

- Anne Evans, Chicago

A: I'm sorry about your unhappy experience on Amtrak. The Empire Builder is a 46-hour train ride through some of the most beautiful parts of the American West. In Amtrak's promotional material, it invites you to ""experience the rugged splendor of the American West"" by traveling along major portions of the Lewis and Clark trail and following the footsteps of early pioneers.

OK, I have to admit, this one's on my bucket list.

Alas, there's no mention of handicapped facilities (or lack thereof) on Amtrak's site. A little research will reveal that Amtrak offers something called a Superliner Accessible Bedroom, a lower-level room that offers enough space for a wheelchair. The room spans the entire width of the train and is designed for use by two adults: a passenger with a mobility impairment and a companion.

You should have reasonably expected the facilities associated with a handicapped-accessible room, including the grab bars and no sharp, protruding objects. Amtrak should be grateful that you pointed out these dangers and ought to fix them after your report. But I'm not sure if anything can be done about the distance from the dining car. Since Amtrak's accessible bedrooms extend the entire width of the train on the lower level, that may be a design limitation.

By the way, if you're thinking of taking a lengthy train trip in the United States, you may want to check Amtrak's 3-D tour feature on its website. You'll get a pretty good idea of what to expect.

When your trip didn't go as expected, a brief email or letter to Amtrak should have quickly addressed your problems. After your travel agent got involved, the company offered a $500 credit toward a future Amtrak trip, which was unacceptable. After your misadventures on the Empire Builder, why would you and your husband try Amtrak again? I would recommend driving in your own car next time. You don't want to rush a trip through the American West. Bring your own car or van to ensure that you have all the amenities you need.

You appealed your decision to several Amtrak executives, which was a great idea. I list the names, numbers and email addresses on my consumer-advocacy site: http://elliott.org/company-contacts/amtrak/ .

I contacted Amtrak on your behalf, and your travel agent also worked hard for a resolution. After some negotiations, the carrier agreed to refund $5

2431991783,"A year full of disheartening news, 2016 got plenty of people involved in efforts to make life better. That's an impulse to take forward in 2017.

I scrolled back through the last 12 months of columns, as journalists do this time of year, and thought I'd found mostly reasons for despair. But when I looked harder I saw something sparkle. I saw the light created by people pushing against challenges.

The news in any year can weigh on people, partly because we humans often focus on what's wrong or dangerous. And that's good - it's why our species survives. We focus on the bad so that we can do something to prevent its awful consequences. But we weren't made for a steady diet of negatives, so in this age we have to keep reminding ourselves that our actions make a difference.

It's all right, even necessary, to feel sad, angry, disgusted, but it is not OK to quit trying to bring the light.

This past year I wrote often about the racial inequality and bias that keep this country from being its best. I wrote several columns about the harm that an irrational attachment to firearms causes. Homelessness was another frequent topic, along with economic inequality, and different efforts to help former prisoners adapt to life on the outside.

My first column of 2016 was about efforts at every level of government to put some restrictions on firearms and access to them, while dealing with an absolute political divide on the matter.

I returned to the problem in May because of a cluster of shootings and other gun-related incidences in Seattle, Shoreline, Des Moines and Federal Way, and then just a week later in a column about a gathering of neighbors in Seattle's Rainier Beach area looking for solutions after another shooting there.

I wrote about the Orlando shootings committed by a man who, like so many others, should never have been able to legally buy a gun, and about police being killed by gunmen and about easy access to military-style weapons - and about the persistent work it's going to take to stop the unnecessary harm that easy access to guns makes possible.

Race is always an issue. I tried in multiple columns to talk about the history that shaped the way race operates in the U.S. and continues to deeply affect people's life prospects, and how in understanding that history we might work toward a better future.

Those columns were prompted by the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement, the presidential campaign and disparities along racial lines in every aspect of American life.

I wrote about Asian Americans fighting to be seen and treated as whole people and fully American, rather than as stereotypes.

I wrote about the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which has energized a broader movement for better treatment of Native Americans. And about the presidential recognition of Elouise Cobell , one of the heroines of recent efforts to get the government to meet its obligations to those Americans. She won a huge settlement against the government in 2009 in a case that other people saw as hopeless.

I wrote about Sharon Chang's book, ""Raising Mixed-Race: Multiracial Asian Children in a Post Racial World,"" which explores a world that is still far from post-racial. The local writer/activist felt compelled to write the book that was missing when she was growing up, a book that would help mixed families navigate the very real impact of race on their lives.

Two books I explored in columns were National Book Award winners this year, and it is a sign of how critical the conversation is about race at this moment that both deal with it, though in very different ways.

Georgia Congressman John Lewis won for ""March,"" a trilogy in graphic-novel format that explores the Civil Rights Movement through his eyes as a participant at the center of that movement. It is a thoughtful, moving and humanizing window into what is sometimes required of citizens to make their country a more just one. Lewis was young when he got involved, and he didn't think he had what it took to move a country forward. But what he had, integrity and stubborn determination, were exactly what was required.

His book is a reminder of how far we have come in overcoming overt racism, but also a reminder that we don't get to rest without risking that progress.

A book by the young scholar Ibram Kendi, meanwhile, begins far in the past and travels forward to help Americans understand the deeply rooted structures and behaviors that hobble us still. Everyone should read "" Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America,"" which shows how racism adapts to every anti-racist victory. Understanding that cycle is a necessary step toward ending it, and in doing so making all of our lives better.

We don't all have to do the same thing, but we should all do something to add to the world.

Phil Davis , a retired teacher, joined protests against nuclear weapons. Entertainer Greg Bennick started his own project to aid Haiti because he couldn't stand seeing the problems there and doing nothing.

I wrote about two local artists , Shawn Landis and Jodi Rockwell, who bought a house and turned it into a place where artists from other countries could live rent-free and work in Seattle for a few weeks. They didn't wait to raise money or create an organization, they just jumped in.

Landis said he follows the punk principle that a person should, ""Do what you can with what you got and hope the rest falls into place and space.""

I think that's a good thought to carry into a new year.

2431992176,"Early each January, the Quadrantid meteor stream provides one of the most intense annual meteor displays, with a brief, sharp maximum lasting only a few hours. And in 2017, viewing circumstances favor North Americans, especially those living west of the Mississippi River. The Quadrantid meteor shower appears to radiate out from the northeast corner of the constellation of Bootes, the herdsman, so you might expect this display to be called the ""Bootids."" But back in the late 18th century, there was a constellation in that location called Quadrans Muralis, the ""Mural or Wall Quadrant"" (an astronomical instrument). It is a long-obsolete star pattern, invented in 1795 by J.J. Lalande to commemorate the instrument used to observe the stars in his catalogue. [2017 Quadrantid Meteor Shower Guide: How & When to See It] Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory discovered the Quadrantid meteor shower in the 1830s, and shortly afterward several astronomers in Europe and America noted it. Thus, the meteors were christened ""Quadrantids,"" and even though the constellation from which these meteors appear to radiate no longer exists, the shower's original moniker continues to this day. Remnants of a long-dead comet At greatest activity, 60 to 120 shower members per hour should be seen. However, the Quadrantid influx is sharply peaked: 6 hours before and after maximum, these blue meteors - a color that results from layers of magnesium burning up during the meteors' entry into Earth's atmosphere - appear at only half of their highest rates. This means that the stream of particles is a narrow one, possibly derived relatively recently from a small comet. In fact, in 2003, astronomer Peter Jenniskens of NASA found the near-Earth asteroid 2003 EH1, which seemed like it was on the right orbit to make the Quadrantids. Some astronomers have said that this asteroid is really a piece of an old, ""extinct"" comet, perhaps one recorded by Chinese, Korean and Japanese observers during the years 1490-91. Maybe that comet broke apart and some of the pieces became the meteoroids that make up the Quadrantid stream. The Quadrantid meteor shower of 2017 will peak on Jan. 3 and 4. This NASA sky-map shows where the shower will appear to radiate out from. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech When and where to look In 2017, a strong display of Quadrantid meteors is likely for North America, particularly over the western half of the continent. Maximum activity is expected at around 1400 GMT on Tuesday, Jan. 3; that corresponds to 9 a.m. Eastern Time, 6 a.m. Pacific Time. Just before the break of dawn, the radiant of this shower - the spot from which the meteors appear to emanate - will be ascending the dark northeastern sky. Those who live in the eastern half of North America will see the ""Quads"" increase in intensity before bright morning twilight and sunrise intervenes, with a single observer likely to see rates of 30 to 60 meteors per hour. For those who live in the western half of North America, meteor rates will probably be even higher, very close to the peak rates of 60 to 120 per hour. With no moonlight to interfere, this might be one of the best meteor displays of the year. But be sure to bundle up! Lastly, and I've touched on this point before, but certainly it should be addressed again: Likely, your local weather will be more appropriate for taking a hot bath as opposed to a meteor shower. And indeed, at this time of year, meteor watching can be a long, cold business. You wait and you wait for meteors to appear, outside in the cold. When they don't appear right away, and if you're cold and uncomfortable, you're not going to be looking for meteors for very long! Therefore, make sure you're warm and comfortable. Warm cocoa or coffee can take the edge off the chill, as well as provide a slight stimulus. It's even better if you can observe with friends. That way, you can cover more sky. Good luck and enjoy this meteor show(er)!

LAS VEGAS-Dell kicked off CES 2017 by adding a some flexibility to one of its most popular notebooks. The company announced the new Dell XPS 13 two-in-one, which takes everything good about the latest Dell XPS 13 notebook and puts it into a convertible design. According to Dell, the priority with this new convertible (as well as the rest of its two-in-one notebooks) was to make a device that could perform well in tablet, tent, and other modes, but that didn't lose the practicality and functionality of a regular laptop.

The cosmetic differences between the new XPS 13 convertible and Dell's original notebook aren't glaring, but they are important. Most noticeable is the new hinge connecting the display to the keyboard deck. Using two geometric attachments, the display is able to flip backwards and lie nearly flat against the back of the keyboard deck. There is space in between the two panels, making it look less seamless than a device like Lenovo's Yoga Book . Also, the display panel and the keyboard deck are not the same length, which makes the keyboard deck jut out slightly more than the lid when in tablet mode.

Dell kept the matte-black, soft-touch finish found on the XPS 13 laptop in this convertible, and the chassis is made of carbon fiber composite and CNC machined aluminum. It shares that sleek and professional look with the original XPS 13, and at 2.7 pounds (1.2kg) it's light and easy to tote from room to room. In the short time I spent with the XPS 13 convertible, it appeared that its steel hinges supported the display enough for the device to be a sturdy laptop as well as a flexible two-in-one. The keyboard deck feels solid as well, so I don't anticipate any wobbliness or balance issues when working with the XPS 13 convertible on your lap.

Valentina Palladino The display and keyboard deck don't lie completely flat against each other in tablet mode. Valentina Palladino The keyboard deck is slightly longer than the display.

Since the new model is a convertible, Dell had to make both display options touch-capable and we're glad it did. The XPS 13 convertible will have two display options: a 13.3-inch, 1920x1080 touchscreen and a same-sized 3200x1800 touchscreen. There's no 4K display option though, which feels like an oversight. Both options support Dell's Active Pen, too, although that's an optional accessory.

Another change we're happy to see is the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor on the keyboard deck (the photos above are of pre-production units, and of XPS 13 convertible models without the fingerprint sensor). This will be an optional hardware perk that you can get if you plan to use it with Windows Hello's biometric security features. And with the addition of the XPS 13 convertible to Dell's lineup, the company will also be updating the XPS 13 notebook to include a fingerprint sensor.

On the flip side, we're bummed that the XPS 13's webcam remains underneath the display panel. This makes the camera's angle not conducive for really anything-however, it will eventually support facial recognition to be used with Windows Hello. We're curious to see how well the camera can recognize faces considering its location, but we'll have to wait for that: a Dell representative told me that the IR features of the camera will be turned on once Microsoft releases the Redstone 2 Update of Windows 10. For ports, the XPS 13 convertible has one USB Type C Thunderbolt 3-enabled port, one USB 3 port, a microSD card slot, a Noble lock slot, and a headphone jack.

In typical Dell fashion, you can customize many of the internals on the XPS 13 two-in-one. You have the choice of a Kaby Lake i5 or i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. A note about the XPS 13's new design and power efficiency: the new design is fanless, and it has temperature sensors that know when the machine is getting too hot. When that happens, the device automatically lowers power to the CPU to prevent overheating the system. Every model has a 46Whr battery inside, and Dell estimates it'll last 15 hours on a single charge.

Overall, Dell fixed some issues we had with the XPS 13 in this new convertible while keeping up with the majority of other PC companies turning popular notebooks into two-in-ones. Check in with Ars to see a full review on the XPS 13 convertible in the coming weeks. The XPS 13 two-in-one will be available this month starting at $999.

2431992331,"Astronomers from across the U.S. are heading to Texas this week for the 229th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). The biannual meeting, which features new developments in astronomy, astrophysics and planetary science, is often called the ""Super Bowl of astronomy."" The event will feature more than 1,600 lectures, short speeches and poster presentations that will highlight the latest research and discoveries, from the solar system to the farthest reaches of the universe. At least 2,400 scientists, students, teachers and journalists will attend, including two Space.com reporters, who will bring you the latest news from the conference right here at Space.com. Attendees will explore a wide variety of space subjects, such as the hunt for exoplanets and the elusive ""Planet Nine""; the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies; the nature of black holes, dark matter and dark energy; solutions to light pollution; the influence U.S. politics will have on astronomy; and astronomers' roles in fighting climate change. For aspiring astronomers, the meeting will host workshops for analyzing astronomical data as well as career planning. ""The biggest astronomy news we know about in advance for 2017 is the Aug. 21 solar eclipse, which will be a total eclipse in a narrow (roughly 70-mile-wide [or 113 kilometers]) band from the Oregon coast to the South Carolina coast,"" AAS press officer Rick Fienberg wrote in an email to Space.com. ""That's one theme that cuts across the whole meeting, with a plenary lecture, a splinter meeting, a poster session, scattered other oral presentations and a seminar for science writers."" [Total Solar Eclipse 2017: When, Where and How to See It (Safely)] These are but a few examples of the vast number of astronomy findings that will be presented at this winter meeting of AAS.

The snow may be falling, but optimism is riding high for Wall Street and investors as we dive headlong into a new year. What began with a whimper in 2016 ended with a bang. In less than two months since the election, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has ticked off more than a dozen all-time highs.

However, not all companies participated in the end-of-year surge or the market's amazing rally from its Feb. 2016 lows. These downtrodden companies provide long-term investors with the opportunity to seize the day and pick out attractively priced high-quality companies that could form the foundation of growth for their portfolio for years to come.

Here are four top stocks trading at discounts that investors should consider buying this winter.

Activision Blizzard, Inc.

We'll begin in the technology sector by taking a closer look at video game developer Activision Blizzard ( NASDAQ:ATVI ) . Shares of Activision are down about 5% year to date, but they've been hit hard over the past quarter as competition in the mobile and online gaming space has heated up.

Image source: Activision Blizzard.

One of the more attractive aspects of Activision Blizzard is its convenience. Whereas some of its peers are still tied to traditional gaming consoles -- and make no mistake about it, Call of Duty is still a major growth driver for the company -- Activision Blizzard has ramped up its reliance on digital revenue. During the third quarter, 86% of its GAAP revenue came from digital sources compared to just 64% in the previous year. We're talking about a more efficient, less costly method of reaching the consumer that should translate into growing profits and better margins for Activision Blizzard.

There's also a lot to like when it comes to Activision's gaming diversity. Even though King, the maker of mobile game Candy Crush , saw a modest quarter-over-quarter revenue decline, its mobile bookings and average revenue per user grew from the prior-year period. Furthermore, the World of Warcraft franchise drove record participation in value-added services. Sporting a PEG ratio of just below 0.8, Activision Blizzard could be a top stock poised to rebound.

Barrick Gold Corporation

Physical gold started 2016 off with a bang, registering its best quarter in 30 years during Q1 2016. After August, though, it all went wrong. The Federal Reserve has returned to its hawkish stance on monetary policy and the dollar has been strengthening, which is all bad news for gold stocks, including Barrick Gold ( NYSE:ABX ) , which has lost around 30% of its value over the past six months.

Image source: .

However, Barrick Gold is perhaps the most cost efficient of all gold miners. It's reduced its all-in sustaining cost (AISC) estimate multiple times this year, with the midpoint of its forecast now at $760 per ounce, a full $370 per ounce below gold's current spot price. What's more, Barrick believes that as it brings new sources of production online, it can push its AISC below $700 per ounce, which would give the company an exceptionally large margin buffer.

At the same time, Barrick has done a remarkable job of reducing its expenses and debt . After ending 2014 with $13.1 billion in debt, Barrick is on track to finish fiscal 2016 with just $8 billion in debt, which means lower interest expenses and more financial flexibility. It's also reduced its capital expenditures by roughly three-quarters in just four years. By focusing on only its highest ore-grade projects, Barrick has laid a foundation for success, even with gold around $1,100 per ounce.

Image source: .

Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC

Mid-cap specialty drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ:JAZZ ) is another top stock to have high up on your watchlist this winter. Jazz's stock has shed more than 20% year to date, mainly on account of both presidential candidates and now President-elect Donald Trump post-election criticism of drug-pricing practices in America. Jazz's lead drug, Xyrem for narcolepsy, increased in price by more than 840% between 2007 and 2014, meaning Jazz Pharmaceuticals could be a prime target should drug reform policies find their way to the president's desk.

But there are a lot of what-ifs regarding pricing reform. First, Trump has a laundry list of priorities to handle, and it's unlikely that drug-pricing reform is anywhere near the top of the list. Also, Republicans, who are in firm control of the House and Senate, are more likely to side with a free market than impose restrictions on drug developers. It probably means companies like Jazz Pharmaceuticals will be able to retain most of their pricing power.

The end result is that Xyrem sales should continue to shine for Jazz, and a new advertising campaign can only help. Xyrem's growth rate is probably going to top 10% once again in 2017. When coupled with its exceptionally low corporate income tax rate -- Jazz is based in Ireland -- that allows it to keep more of its profits, this single-digit forward P/E top stock looks to be an incredible value.

Image source: Skechers.

Skechers USA Inc.

Another top stock expected to take a step in the right direction this winter is footwear and accessories retailer Skechers USA ( NYSE:SKX ) . Skechers' rough 2016 sent its shares down by nearly 20%. Much of the blame can be credited to earnings weakness caused by a fire in its Malaysian warehouse, adverse currency effects, and a shift in its domestic whole business into a later quarter.

The best news for shareholders is that Skechers' issues in 2016 are probably going to be confined to just a few quarters. While a warehouse fire is unfortunate, it's not a recurring cost. Likewise, though currency can adversely impact Skechers' top and bottom lines, it's not as if we as investors can look past currency moves to get a feel for how the underlying business is performing. During the third quarter, Skechers wound up recording a 10.1% increase in year-over-year sales, which continues its recent trend of double-digit sales growth.

Skechers' aggressive expansion plans outside the U.S. should also intrigue prospective investors. Nearly three-quarters of Skechers' stores are located outside the U.S., which could be a smart strategic move that results in higher growth rates. Of course, it could also lead to high spending and a few quarterly hiccups. Investors who keep their eye on the long term are probably going to be rewarded with a superior growth rate compared to its retail footwear peers.

2431995409,"Location tag company TrackR has outed its latest, smallest, and most affordable trackers yet, the TrackR pixel and TrackR wallet 2.0. Revealed ahead of CES 2017 this week, the two new gadgets each use Bluetooth to link to a nearby smartphone. If you walk away from your keys, or can't find your TV remote, or have lost your wallet between the sofa cushions, the promise is that these trackers should help you find them.

That's much the same as TrackR 's previous dongles, but the watchword here is cheaper and more convenient. TrackR pixel, for instance, is up for preorder at $24.99, versus the $29.99 of the older bravo version , but is smaller and lighter than its predecessor. Available in nine colors, it's now 26mm in diameter and 5mm thick, or about the thickness of two quarters.

Despite that, the company has also found space to squeeze in an LED. That can flash when remotely triggered, making it easier to spot a missing item in a bag or purse, for instance. TrackR says it'll start shipping in the Spring of 2017.

As for TrackR wallet 2.0, that offers much the same functionality but a different form-factor. As the name implies, it's intended to fit into your wallet, and thus is shaped like a credit card. It's actually the thickness of about two such cards, or 2mm, and is made out of carbon fiber.

Despite the dimensions, TrackR has managed to keep the replaceable battery support from the first-generation wallet. When it runs flat, you can switch out the CR2016 rather than, as per some trackers on the market, having to buy a whole new device. It's up for preorder today, priced at $29.99, and will ship in the late spring of 2017.

Finally, TrackR's Atlas - the Bluetooth/WiFi bridge that plugs into a spare outlet and maps your home, allowing you to see the location of each tracking tag on a floorplan - is finally ready to ship. As well as notifications when items move from one room to another, and a history of where they've been, there's Amazon Alexa integration so users can ask where missing items are. Announced more than a year ago , it was intended to hit shelves midway through 2016, but is only just making it to full preorder today, priced at $39.99. TrackR says Atlas should ship in Spring 2017."

2431996955,"Phoenix Suns forward Dragan Bender (35) has continued to get better with playing time.(Photo: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports) LOS ANGELES - It was a veteran move. At least, something you might not expect from a 19-year-old playing in his 27th NBA contest.

With the shot clock winding down in the fourth quarter of Saturday's loss at Utah, Suns rookie Dragan Bender leaned in and drew a foul on Rodney Hood as he quickly attempted a 3-pointer, earning three free throws.

Problem: The sold-out crowd at the Vivint Smart Home Arena didn't like the call, especially once the replay ran on video boards throughout the arena. And so with the Suns leading 79-78 and Bender standing at the foul line, the Jazz fans voiced their displeasure.

""I haven't heard this crowd that loud in a long time, since I played here with Coach (Jerry) Sloan,'' said Suns coach Earl Watson, referring to three seasons he spent in Utah near the end of his playing career. ""It was a great learning experience for him.""

The 7-foot-1 Bender missed the first shot. The crowd roared.

He missed the second. The crowd roared even louder.

He swished the third.

""I haven't shot a lot of free throws,"" Bender said after the game, a 91-86 Utah win. ""I think I've shot like four or five (actually six) this season. That's something I don't do a lot because I spend a lot of time on the perimeter trying to space the court. I'm definitely looking forward to working and trying to improve on that.""

As the Suns enter 2017, Bender has become a rotation priority, which means learning a different NBA lesson each night. After playing sparingly for much of December, Bender - the No. 4 overall pick in last June's draft - has averaged 21.5 minutes over the last four games, scoring 7.8 points and hitting six 3-pointers.

Even if the results don't always show up in a major way on the stat sheet, Watson sees progress. He offered an example of Phoenix's Dec. 28 contest against the Spurs, when San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich went at both Bender and fellow rookie Marquese Chriss in the second half, dumping the ball into Pau Gasol and LaMarcus Aldridge.

""You see Dragan, and it's so funny just watching him in the game sometimes,'' Watson said. ""Sometimes you have to just fall in love with reality. Dragan is so skinny compared to Pau Gasol and he's fighting him on the post. And then he gets a deflection and you look in Dragan's eyes and you see this sense of conviction that 'I'm capable,' or' I'm ready,' or 'I'm competitive,' or 'It's not going to be that easy.'' '

Bender - listed at 225 pounds - knows teams will continue to target him.

""That's what happens to rookies in the first year, especially with me,'' he said. ""I'm not in a physical position to battle these guys at some point. Definitely, it's an experience for me to learn how to use my body to learn how to defend those guys.""

It's all part of learning on the job.

""He's coming out and playing hard,"" Suns forward P.J. Tucker said. ""He listens. As a rookie, that's all you can ask for.""

In 2016, the enterprise technology market had a wild ride: From explosive IPOs to mega-mergers to surprise acquisitions, it was rarely boring.

Here's what we think we'll see in 2017 - the continued rise of Amazon, a new day in the White House, and more.

Amazon will keep on winning... Mario Tama/

Amazon Web Services, the retail giant's $12 billion cloud computing business, is already the most profitable unit in the company .

And yet, pretty much everyone agrees that AWS has yet to peak, continuing to win over large and small companies alike.

...but Google and Microsoft will continue to be strong rivals as they jockey for position. Google

In 2016, Microsoft and Google - widely seen as the second- and third-place contenders in the cloud wars with Amazon, respectively - made big hires and masterminded partnerships and acquisitions to bolster out their sales pitch to enterprises.

Amazon may be the undisputed leader in the space, but Microsoft and Google aren't taking it lying down. Watch this space: The cloud computing market is still growing, and so vicious competition will be the order of the day.

Salesforce will hit $10 billion in revenue. Salesforce

Salesforce, one of the first (and still the biggest) cloud software companies for the enterprise, is on track to hit $10 billion in revenue in 2017.

It's a big milestone for the company, but it also proves that the world is really moving towards cloud computing in general. Salesforce is leading the pack, but it proves a lot for smaller companies, too, even as titans like Microsoft and Oracle rev up their competitive strategies.

2432006041,":: แปลแถลงการณ์ฉบับสุดท้าย ในเหตุระเบิดของ Falcon 9 - Falcon 9 พร้อมขึ้นบินอีกครั้ง :: 

ช่วงเวลาตลอด 4 เดือนที่ผ่านมา ทีมเจ้าหน้าที่จากสำนักงานบริหารการบินแห่งชาติ (FAA) , กองทัพอากาศสหรัฐฯ , NASA, NTSB และผู้เชี่ยวชาญในด้านอุตสหากรรมการบิน ได้ร่วมมือกับ SpaceX ในการตรวจหาความผิดพลาดที่เกิดขึ้นในวันที่ 1 กันยายน ณ ฐานปล่อย Launch Complex 40 ฐานทัพอากาศเคอเนอเวอรัล ทีมตรวจสอบได้ถูกจัดตั้งขึ้นตามนโยบายการตรวจสอบของ SpaceX และได้รับอนุมัติจาก FAA 

ทีมตรวจสอบได้อาศัยช่องทางกว่า 3,000 ช่องทาง ทั้งภาพ วิดีโอ และข้อมูลต่าง ๆ เราได้ตรวจพบข้อผิดพลาดเป็นเวลา 93 มิลลิวินาที ก่อนจะเกิดเหตุการระเบิด และเนื่องจากเหตุดังกล่าวเกิดขึ้นบนพื้นดิน ทำให้ทีมสามารถตรวจสอบข้อมูลเพิ่มเติมได้จากทั้ง ข้อมูลที่ส่งผ่านสาย (เชื่อมต่อเข้ากับ Falcon 9 โดยตรง) และที่สำคัญ ได้มีการรวบรวมเศษซากต่าง ๆ เพื่อส่งไปตรวจสอบยังสำนักงานใหญ่ของเราใน Hawthorne มลรัฐแคลิฟอร์เนีย และฐานทดสอบใน McGregor มลรัฐเทกซัส 

ทีมตรวจสอบได้พบความผิดพลาดในตัวอุปกรณ์ ชื่อ composite overwrapped pressure vessels หรือ COPV ซึ่งเป็นอุปกรณ์สำคัญในถังออกซิเจนเหลว ในท่อนที่สองของจรวด (Second Stage) ข้อผิดพลาดดังกล่าว เกิดจากการจับตัวกันเป็นของแข็งของออกซิเจน (ในอุณหภูมิที่ต่ำมาก ๆ) ซึ่งเกิดขึ้นในท่อนำของตัวอุปกรณ์ชุด COPVs

ในแต่ละส่วนของ Falcon 9 ได้มีการใช้อุปกรณ์ COPV ที่บรรจุแก๊สฮีเลี่ยม ไว้สำหรับการปรับความดันในถังออกซิเจนเหลว และ COPV แต่ละตัวจะประกอบไปด้วยท่ออลูมิเนียมที่หุ้มด้วยคาร์บอนไฟเบอร์ สำหรับ Falcon 9 ลำที่เกิดการระเบิด เจ้าหน้าที่ได้พบอุปกรณ์ COPV ดังกล่าว และสามารถสรุปสาเหตุได้ว่า ออกซิเจนเหลว (ณ อุณหภูมิเย็นจัดจนเกือบเป็นของแข็ง) ได้ไหลเข้าไปในตัว buckles ซึ่งอยู่ภายในแผ่นคาร์บอนไฟเบอร์ที่ได้หุ้มเอาไว้ เมื่ออยู่ในจุดที่ความดันนั้น ออกซิเจนเหลวที่ไหลเข้าไปจะค้างอยู่ภายใน และเมื่อเกิดการฉีกหรือแตกออกของไฟเบอร์ที่หุ้มเอาไว้ จะทำให้เกิดประกายเพลิงเพียงเล็กน้อย แต่ด้วยออกซิเจนแรงดันมหาศาล ทำให้เกิดเป็นการระเบิดออกมา ทีมตรวจสอบยังอธิบายเพิ่มเติมว่า การที่ใช้ฮีเลียมเหลวในการหล่อเย็นและปรับความดันนั้น อุณหภูมิที่เย็นจัด (ซึ่งเป็นเทคนิคที่ SpaceX ใช้ในการอัดแรงดันเสริม ทำให้บรรจุออกซิเจนเหลวได้เยอะ ๆ) จะทำให้ออกซิเจนแข็งตัว มีความหนืดสูง และเข้าไปติดได้ง่ายมาก 

ทีมตรวจสอบ ได้พยายามหาสาเหตุอื่น ๆ เพิ่มเติม ซึ่งทั้งหมดล้วนแล้วแต่สนับสนุนแนวคิดที่ว่าความผิดพลาดเดินจาก มีออกซิเจนเหลวที่เกือบเป็นของแข็ง หรือออกซิเจนแข็งเข้าไปติดในอุปกรณ์ชุด COPV ในการแก้ไขระยะสั้นเจ้าหน้าที่จึงได้ทำการเปลี่ยน ชุดอุปกรณ์ COPV และใช้ฮีเลียมเหลวที่มีอุณหภูมิสูงกว่านี้ (แรงดันต่ำกว่า) โดยอ้างอิงจากกระบวรการเติมฮีเลียมเหลว ที่ผ่านการใช้งานมากว่า 700 ครั้ง และประสบควาามสำเร็จ (ทั้งจาก Falcon 9 และจรวดอื่น ๆ) ส่วนในระยะยาว จะมีการออกแบบอุปกรณ์ชุด COPV ดังกล่าวใหม่หมด ซึ่งในส่วนนี้ จะทำให้กระบวรการเติมเชื้อเพลิงเร็วขึ้นด้วย 

SpaceX จะกลับมาบินอีกครั้งด้วยจรวด Falcon 9 จากฐานปล่อย ณ ฐานทัพอากาศ Vandenberg's ด้วยการปล่อยดาวเทียม ridium NEXT ในวันที่ 8 มกราคมนี้ 

SpaceX ขอขอบคุณทุกฝ่ายที่สนับสนุน รวมถึงลูกค้าของเราที่ช่วยเหลือให้เราผ่านเหตุการณ์นี้มาได้ เราจะทำทุกอย่างเพื่อให้บรรลุซึ่งภารกิจของเรา ตลอดปี 2017 นี้และตลอดไป

2432011122,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Hundreds of birders - mostly amateurs with a deep knowledge of identifying species on the wing - have been fanning out in New Jersey in organized groups. They have been counting how many birds of each of the state's species they can spot on a single day between Dec. 14 and Jan. 5.

In New Jersey, 27 counting groups each cover their own circular area 15 miles in diameter, William J. Boyle Jr., of Cape May, told The Press of Atlantic City (

http://bit.ly/2ijKXCg

 ). He's an author of books on the state's birds who compiles reports on data from New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

It's called the Christmas Bird Count, and it's going on around the state, nation and world. Sponsored by the National Audubon Society, it's the longest-running citizen-science bird-counting project in the nation. The data collected helps track the relative health of species globally.

Because of the work, we know the bald eagle population has rebounded after almost being driven to extinction by hunters and the pesticide DDT.

Another raptor, a small falcon called the merlin, has moved its wintering grounds north, increasing its numbers in South Jersey.

But a relative, North America's smallest falcon, the American kestrel, has plummeted in population here and elsewhere in the U.S. Researchers are still trying to understand why. The kestrel eats mostly insects and some mice. The merlin is mainly a bird-eater.

One of the last counts is the Cumberland Count around the Union Lake and Eugene D. Bevans wildlife management areas on New Year's Day, organized for the past 10 years by Michael Fritz, 51, of Seaville in Upper Township.

Fritz said 14 teams will cover the Cumberland area from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The Cumberland Count, which has been done for about 50 years, has one of the highest sightings of American bald eagles in the U.S., he said.

""We routinely see 70 to 80,"" Fritz said.

Barnegat Township and Marmora in Upper Township also count on New Year's Day.

Becky Hedden, of Manahawkin in Stafford Township, is president of Atlantic Audubon and runs the Marmora count, now in its 44th year. Her area is based around the Lester G. MacNamara Wildlife Management Area but goes as far east as Ocean City and as far north as Linwood, she said.

She will have 10 to 15 people helping that day.

When the Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act was passed in 1973, the state had just one nesting pair of bald eagles. Now, after decades of protection, there are more than 150 pairs, most in Cumberland and Salem counties, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.

The CBC started 116 years ago as a way to get people to count birds instead of shooting them.

""There was a tradition in England of going out on Boxing Day - the day after Christmas - to shoot wrens,"" Boyle said.

In North America, there were holiday competitions among hunters called the Side Hunt to see which teams could shoot the most critters, both birds and mammals.

Ornithologist Frank M. Chapman was among the scientists concerned about declining bird populations due to overhunting. So in 1900, he proposed a new holiday tradition, a Christmas Bird Census, according to the Audubon website.

The then-new Audubon Society adopted the practice. Today, hundreds of counts are held worldwide.

The CBC provides solid data on species facing population increases and decreases in winter and helps identify trends, such as a recent tendency for species to move north.

""One thing I have seen: There are a lot of southern species - what people in the birding world call half-hardy - that are pushing it to try to spend the winter in New Jersey. More and more of them are staying around,"" Boyle said.

Some southern species spending more winters here are the chipping sparrow, black and turkey vultures, and the merlin falcon, Boyle said.

""Years ago, the black vultures were not here,"" he said. ""And the merlin used to be very rare in New Jersey in the wintertime. Now it has become not common but certainly not rare by any means compared to 25 to 30 years ago.""

The CBC data are combined with the U.S. Geological Survey's Breeding Bird Survey taken during May and June to get population estimates.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency has used the CBC data in its reports as an indicator of climate change, and the North American Bird Conservation Initiative of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service used it in its overview of 40 years of data for the report, ""State of the Birds 2009.""

That report found that about one-third of the 800 U.S. bird species are in serious decline due to habitat loss, invasive species and other threats.

Struggling species include the eastern meadowlark, bobolink and savannah sparrow, Boyle said. All are grasslands birds that need successional habitat of tall grasses and small bushes, and that habitat continues to be lost in the state.

""Changing agricultural practices have resulted in farmers mowing their fields,"" Boyle said.

Counts always have been a social event, as well, said Mark Garland, director of the Monarch Monitoring Project at New Jersey Audubon's Cape May Bird Observatory.

He participated in the Cape May count earlier this month and plans to help with the Cumberland Count. It's a fun day out with other birders, he said.

Numbers from this year's count need to be compiled and verified, so they won't be available for a while, Boyle said.

A counting group that dropped out last year left the Belleplain State Forest area uncounted. That area had been counted for 28 years.

Boyle is looking for volunteers to lead a count again in Belleplain.

Pretty much all of the state's other areas are covered, he said.

With its non-expandable memory, one of the major bugbears for iPhone owners is the storage capacity. Whether you've got a 16 or 64GBer, you just know that dreaded ""Storage Almost Full"" message will pop up at exactly the wrong moment.

While there are steps you can take should that happen , it's also good practice to try and tread lightly on your memory in the first place. There are a few neat, easy tricks to try and make your iPhone's storage capacity last as long as possible.

1. Don't shoot everyday video in high res

While for some it may be essential to shoot video with their iPhones in the highest resolution possible, for most people's everyday cute kitty clips a lower resolution will suffice.

You can change how the iPhone capture film footage by heading to ""Settings,"" then ""Photos & Camera,"" then look for where your phone gives you the ""Record Video"" options. Click on this to select 720p at 30fps. Simply change it back when you do want higher quality footage.

2. Don't keep messages forever

By default, your iPhone saves all your text and multimedia messages forever. It's unlikely you really want iMessage, SMS and MMS correspondence going back years, so there is a way to have messages automatically delete after a sensible timeframe.

In your ""Settings"" menu, scroll down to see the ""Messages"" option. From here look for the ""Message History"" section, tap it and then you can choose to delete messages after 30 days or a year.

3. Don't keep all photos when shooting HDR

The iPhone camera's ""high dynamic range"" setting is a clever tool when used correctly, but can be a real memory hog if you use it often. This is because it takes multiple exposures before combining those snaps into the HDR version.

Rather than save down all the exposures, you can make your phone only save the final HDR pic. Find this option in ""Settings,"" then ""Photos & Camera,"" then scroll down to see the option to ""Keep Normal Photo."" Toggle it to off to save some storage space.

4. Don't automatically download purchases made on another iDevice

If you have multiple Apple devices, there's a default setting that sees all purchases across all devices automatically downloaded to every device linked with that iTunes account.

While there will be apps and content you want to double up on, this is almost certainly not the case for every single purchase.

To stop your iDevice doing this, go to ""Settings,"" then ""iTunes & App Store."" Here you can toggle off to stop the automatic download of music, apps, books and audiobooks and updates.

5. Don't keep high resolution photos on your iPhone

If you've activated the iCloud Photo Library service, then you can choose to enable a setting that saves you a ton of photo storage space.

The option to ""Optimize iPhone Storage"" saves your pics and vids to your Camera Roll as per usual, but in a smaller format. The full-res originals are stored in iCloud, ready to access whenever you might need them.

If you go to ""Settings,"" then ""iCloud,"" then ""Photos"" and select ""Optimize iPhone Storage"" you'll be all set up.

2432016924,"It's a computer game populated by floating, light-beam-wielding monsters, but ""Ghostlight Manor"" has another purpose beyond entertainment: to help newly minted grads better prepare for their first job.

That's the strategy behind the University of Washington Bothell's Digital Future Lab , which runs a gaming studio as a novel way to get students ready for life after college.

It turns out that developing a computer game involves using a raft of skills also necessary in most offices today, said Jason Pace, the lab's executive director and a former manager at Microsoft. Producing a game involves software development, creative and artistic skills, project management and marketing, to name a few.

And with its focus on diversity on a campus where minority students make up about half the enrollment, the lab may contribute to diversifying the region's tech workplace as well, Pace hopes.

Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.

Over three years, a roving cast of about 60 students created ""Ghostlight Manor."" The game is now being marketed commercially , the first time one created by UW Bothell has been released for sale. If it's a hit, students will share in the profits.

""It was so fun - it was ridiculously fun,"" said Jerri Roberts, a 2015 graduate of UW Bothell. The experience helped her land a job as a communications specialist at T-Mobile.

Roberts, who grew up in Woodinville and majored in media and communications, had only a casual interest in computer games before she joined the Digital Future Lab.

She has worked as a producer on two different games, ""Ghostlight Manor"" and the soon-to-be-released ""Corrupted.""

To do the job, she had to mediate among all the different student-interns - including developers, artists, designers and audio experts. She learned the production flow and how to problem-solve at crunchtime, when a deadline loomed. And she did a voice-over for one of the characters.

She said it was hard not to have fun when the products they were creating were all about entertainment. ""We would have arguments in meetings about what color a zombie should be,"" she said.

Workplace diversity

The Digital Future Lab works as an in-house internship opportunity for students studying on the Bothell campus, said Pace, the lab director.

Undergraduate and graduate students can work on games or do research, and that counts toward course credits. The lab also does virtual-reality research. About 40 to 60 students participate each quarter.

Pace, who worked for years as a Microsoft hiring manager, knows about the ""transition pain"" that happens when new college graduates join the working world.

""It takes about a year to understand the rhythm of business. One of the lab's goals is to mitigate that first-year pain.""

Video games are well-known for their levels of violence, and for appealing to an audience of mostly young men . So the lab makes a special effort to focus on diversity and does not produce violent games, said Pace and Aina Braxton, the lab's program coordinator.

""I'm a very out-and-proud queer person, and Aina is a woman of color,"" Pace said. ""And you're not going to find many interactive-media studios run by two people like us."" Both have also been active in social causes.

About half the Digital Future Lab students identify as women - the lab includes transgender and non-binary (not identifying as male or female) students, Pace said. About half are students of color.

And this year, the lab started a partnership with Bellevue College's Autism Spectrum Navigators program, and is offering students with autism a chance to intern.

Roberts, the graduate now at T-Mobile, said she liked the focus on a diverse workplace, and on using safe and inclusive language that made all feel welcome.

""That doesn't mean every idea got executed, or everyone got their way, but we all felt safe to express ourselves,"" Roberts said. ""It made it a very easy and fun space to work and create things.""

That diversity in the lab may have had a subtle influence on the development of ""Ghostlight Manor,"" Pace said. The next game release, ""Corrupted,"" has a main character who is female.

The lab also aims to teach that diverse teams benefit a company's bottom line, Pace said.

Mix of talents

Braxton, the lab's program coordinator, interviews each applicant for the lab's internships and tries to figure out what talents they bring that might not necessarily appear to fit in software development.

A student who wants to be an audio engineer, or who composed music in high school, might find his or her niche in making the sound components of the game, for example.

Even a student involved in geopolitical research can put their talents to use by combing through the games for ideas or representations that could be offensive in other cultures, Pace said.

""We're basically teaching the basics of software development, but we're also lining up with what they might need extra skills in,"" Braxton said.

Senior Malik Bseikri worked in the Digital Future Lab for two years. Bseikri, who is majoring in business, did project management for the lab, which includes creating three months of work planning schedules for students working on the game, and keeping people motivated and on-task.

He's also helped sell the game during marketing conventions.

""It really does parallel with exactly what I'm studying,"" said Bseikri, who grew up in Lynnwood and had little interest in video games before he started. ""It's been an awesome experience.""

UW Bothell has donated 10,000 copies of the game to a North Carolina nonprofit, Stack-Up, which will distribute them to military members, because there's research showing that playing certain types of video games can help veterans deal with stress, pain, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

""Ghostlight Manor"" tries to capture the ethos of an arcade game from the 1980s, one that requires skill but is easy to learn how to play. It's designed for a PC or a Mac and costs $14.99.

If it makes money, the profits will be shared among the students using a point system that gives them credit for the amount of time they worked on the game.

In March, the game will be available as a Windows 10 app with Xbox Live integration, allowing gamers to play against each other.

""We're attempting to re-envision video games as experiences that are fun for the widest range of people, in the same way that classic board games are fun for everyone,"" Pace said.

The night sky for the year 2017 busily begins with beautiful planets and shooting stars.

Venus and Mars loiter in the west-southwestern sky after sunset. The vibrant Venus, a spectacular beacon at -4.4 magnitude (very bright) gets more luminous toward January's end, and the dimmer, red Mars at 0.9 magnitude (bright) becomes slightly less bright.

The sliver of a young moon approaches Venus and Mars on Sunday - as the moon will be on Venus' side. On Monday, the slightly thicker moon hangs out between the two planets.

By mid-month, Venus and Mars appear closer by a few degrees in the west-southwestern sky after dusk and may need a cosmic chaperon to keep them apart. In the waning days of January, the far-less bright Mars and the ebullient Venus are about 5 degrees away from one another.

Jupiter - hanging out near the star Spica in the constellation Virgo - rises in the east at about 1 a.m. now. In the middle of January, the big gassy planet rises just after midnight. At dawn now, it will be high in the south. Jupiter is conspicuous at -1.9 magnitude (quite bright) early in January and -2 magnitude late in the month.

The ringed Saturn rises just ahead of the rising sun by mid-month in the southeast, and the fleet Mercury makes a cameo appearance in the morning sky - also, just ahead of the sun in mid-month - in the east-southeast.

Shooting stars! The Quadrantid meteor shower peaks on Tuesday morning, according to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The official peak occurs during morning daylight hours in the eastern United States, but devoted stargazers here may catch meteors in the hours before sunrise.

Generally, meteors occur when Earth passes through dusty comet trail. For the Quadrantids, asteroid 2003 EH1 (perhaps a comet, says Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory) likely forged the granular path.

The sun sets at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Jan. 4 here - that's the first 5 p.m. sunset we've seen since Nov. 7. Until Jan. 9, the sun rises here at 7:27 a.m., the latest sunrises of the year, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. New Year's Day offers 9 hours and 30 minutes of official sunlight for the Washington area, but Jan. 31 provides 10 hours and 14 minutes of glorious solar gleam.

2432022212,"Solar panels are quickly becoming one of the most popular options for green energy. Even Tesla, headed by Silicon Valley guru Elon Musk, has started marketing solar panels for the home. Musk has even gone so far as to power an entire island to show how efficient his new panels are.

With all of the new information available, however, it can be difficult to determine if solar is right for your home. That's where we can help.

Need-To-Know Information

When deciding whether or not solar power is the best option for your home or business, there are five pieces of information you need to consider, including:

Usable sunlight hours-How much usable sunlight your solar panels can collect during the day.

Energy usage-How many kilowatt hours worth of energy your home or business uses each month.

Square footage-How much square footage you have available, and how many square feet of solar panels you need.

Incentives-What incentives your state or local government offers for the installation of solar panels on your property.

Regulations-Any rules or laws regulating the installation of solar panels on private property in your area.

While this might seem like a lot of information to collect, we've got some tools to help you do it faster and easier than you might think.

1. Usable Sunlight Hours

How many hours of sunlight do you see every single day? Depending on where you live, that could be anywhere from less than 30 minutes to more than eight hours. Now, how many of those hours of sunlight are actually usable and could be utilized to produce electricity? It's less than you might think.

The first step is to know how much sun your house gets . By inputting your address or locating your property on a map, sites like SunCalc can show you the property's daylight hours. For example, if you look at the city of Miami, Florida, it shows that usable daylight hours are between 7:04am and 5:35pm local time. Those numbers are specifically for December 21 and they will vary slightly as the days pass.

Additionally, the actual usable daylight hours will depend on local weather patterns and a number of other variables. For example, an address in Redwood, CA, one of the sunniest places in the country, will receive an average of 1,830 hours of usable sunlight per year.

2. Energy Usage

How much energy does your household or business use? It often depends on where you live-homes in colder climates that utilize electric heating may use more electricity than those in warmer climates that do not. The U.S. Energy Information Administration found that, on average, the annual household energy consumption is 10,812 kilowatt hours each year , or 910 kilowatt hours per month.

Your monthly power bill can be a great resource for learning your home's average energy usage as well. Most power companies will outline your average power usage on your bill as well as compare it to the year before. This can be a great tool to help you calculate the cost ahead of time and keep track of your overall electricity usage.

3. Square Footage

You probably know the square footage of your home, but do you know the available square footage of your roof?

While you can get an accurate measurement by contacting a local solar contractor, that can be time consuming and costly. Google's Project Sunroof uses Google Earth's images to estimate the available amount of square footage available for solar panel installation, and all you need to do is plug in your address. The site also compares this estimated amount of square footage available with the estimated square footage of solar panels that would be required to power your home.

Let's look back at that Redwood home we mentioned earlier. According to Sunroof's estimations, the home has approximately 1,434 square feet of roof space available to build solar panels, and it would need to have approximately 264 square feet of panels installed to cover up to 100 percent of the home's electricity usage.

4. Incentives

Most states offer incentives for homeowners who choose to install solar panels on their homes or businesses. There are some incentives at the federal level as well. These vary from loans and grants to tax credits, and the exact details of each incentive often change from state to state.

Multiple sites offer up-to-date databases of all the incentives being offered in the participating states and territories. It might take a bit of time to research what your state has to offer, but it can help you save quite a bit on your initial investment.

5. Regulations

Are there any regulations in your area you might need to consider before you install solar panels? One of the most common requirements is to obtain the necessary permits-such as building and electrical-from your city's or county's building department.

Your solar panel provider often takes care of this step. Be sure to follow up with them, though, to ensure everything is taken care of.

Making the Decision

Now that you have all the information, how can you decide quickly whether solar is the right choice for you? Ask yourself these questions:

Does my property get enough usable sunlight?

Do I have enough available square footage to install the right number of solar panels to offset my energy costs?

Will this investment pay for itself in a reasonable amount of time?

If you can answer yes to all three of those questions, then solar is the best choice for you, and it's time to start calling contractors and looking into those incentives.

If you answered no to any or all of the questions, don't despair! While solar might not be the best choice for your home, due to whatever reason, it is not the only option in green energy. You can research other options that are available in your area. You might also be able to get together with your community to come up with the best green energy options for your city, town or neighborhood.

2432027458,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. - It was a decision Pete Carroll said went against every instinct in his body. But with roughly 10 minutes to play in the 25-23 victory Sunday over the San Francisco 49ers, the man who espouses to Win Forever suddenly went along with the idea that he had to worry more about winning next week than winning right now. So Carroll pulled quarterback Russell Wilson (officially with 9:29 left) and a few other starters to keep them out of harm's way once it became clear Seattle would have to open the playoffs on Saturday at home against Detroit in the wild-card round. That fate was sealed when Atlanta held on to its big lead to beat New Orleans, denying the Seahawks a chance at the No. 2 seed and a bye in the first round. Seattle, instead, will be the No. 3 seed and assured a home game next weekend and then go on the road to Atlanta in the divisional round if it wins. Photos | Box | Full coverage Seahawks secure No. 3 seed with 25-23 win over 49ers Grading the game: Seahawks again struggle in the run game Seattle sports world reacts to Seahawks securing No. 3 seed One word to describe Seahawks' win over 49ers? Unconvincing The biggest issue for the Seahawks? They still can't run the ball The Lions are a better matchup for the Seahawks in the NFL playoffs than the Packers Watch: Jimmy Graham shows off basketball skills with boxout and catch Watch: Luke Willson's TD catch get Seahawks back in the game vs. 49ers Carroll, though, described having to think about a game other than the one right in front of him as feeling like he was in outer space. ""I'm never in that frame of mind,"" Carroll said. ""And I will always challenge that thought. I hate backing off at any time ever. I can't remember doing it very many times, if ever. Just thought we needed to do something to do what we could to protect ourselves for next week."" Seattle was ahead 25-16 at the time, while Atlanta was ahead of New Orleans 38-13 heading into the fourth quarter. Both games then gave Carroll potentially even more reason to feel a little queasy as the 49ers scored with 5:42 left to close to 25-23, while the Saints mounted a last-gasp rally to get to 38-32. But ultimately, the decision worked out as backup quarterback Trevone Boykin led a drive to kill the last 5:42 while the Falcons held on to win and keep the No. 2 seed. Carroll said once he pulled Wilson he never wavered, even after the 49ers scored. Wilson, whose battles with three separate injuries this season undoubtedly played a factor in the decision, likewise said it was hard for him to come off the field - he had played the first two snaps of the drive before being replaced by Boykin. ""At the end of the day, you've got to trust coach and his opinions,"" Wilson said. ""He knows what he's doing. ""When coach made the decision, I was for it. I saw that some other guys weren't playing, too, (such as Thomas Rawls, Michael Bennett, Jimmy Graham and Doug Baldwin). We knew that we were going to have a home game (next weekend) so that was kind of our focus, trying to get some rest and trying to get ready and allow nothing crazy to happen."" Surreal describes much of what happened earlier as the 49ers played the game with the specter of the imminent firing of general manager Trent Baalke and coach Chip Kelly. Despite that, it was the 49ers who looked like the playoff team early, scoring touchdowns on drives of 75 and 79 yards on its second and third possessions of the game, at which point San Francisco had a 155-10 edge in yards. Seahawks middle linebacker Bobby Wagner said the 49ers crossed up Seattle with some different blocking schemes in their zone-read running game. Wagner said the Seahawks' front seven specifically had to change how it was filling in gaps on running plays. ""Once we made our adjustments we were fine,"" Wagner said. Still, the 49ers led 14-6 midway through the second quarter when Athyba Rubin forced a fumble that Frank Clark recovered and returned to the 49ers' 15. That set up a Wilson to Luke Willson touchdown pass that made it 14-13. The next time Seattle had the ball, Wilson threw a pass on which Doug Baldwin made a leaping grab over Rashard Robinson for a 41-yard gain to get the Seahawks out of a hole. ""A ridiculous catch,"" Carroll marveled later. Two plays later, Wilson scrambled and threw it up for grabs for tight end Jimmy Graham, who boxed out San Francisco safety Antoine Bethea to make the catch at the 1. ""I loved the fact that Russell saw Jimmy down there and threw the ball up for him to go make a play and he did,"" Carroll said. ""I thought that was awesome."" Seattle never trailed again. But neither did Atlanta, leaving the Seahawks to take solace in the fact that the win allowed Seattle to have 10 victories for a fifth consecutive season and go into the playoffs on an upbeat note, especially after the surprising home loss to Arizona the week before. But if the regular season had a few more bumps and bruises than expected, Carroll said that's all forgotten now. ""All these worries you guys have (about how the team is playing), I ain't got them,"" Carroll said. ""We are going to go play football the way we know how to play and go for it one game at a time, just like we always do."" As the locker room emptied out, it remained unknown who the Seahawks would play, as the results from earlier in the day meant Seattle would get the loser of the Green Bay-Detroit game. Wagner, asked who he wanted to play, said he didn't care. Then he smiled and recalled Seattle's 38-10 defeat at Green Bay last month. ""But if we play Green Bay, to get them back, that'd be tight,"" he said. Playoff picture The Seahawks finished as the No. 3 seed in the NFC playoffs and will face the Lions at CenturyLink Field on Saturday. Six teams make the playoffs in each conference, with the four division winners seeded by record, followed by two wild-card teams. The top two division winners earned first-round byes: Team W-L Playoff status 1. Dallas 13-3 NFC East winner 2. Atlanta 11-5 NFC South winner 3. Seattle 10-5-1 NFC West winner 4. Green Bay 10-6 NFC North winner 5. N.Y. Giants 11-5 Wild card 6. Detroit 9-7 Wild card

SpaceX Accident Investigation Update

January 2, 2017, 9:00am EST

Over the past four months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Air Force (USAF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), along with several industry experts, have collaborated with SpaceX on a rigorous investigation to determine the cause of the anomaly that occurred September 1 at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This investigation team was established according to SpaceX's accident investigation plan as approved by the FAA. As the primary federal licensing body, the FAA provided oversight and coordination for the investigation.

Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events - there were just 93 milliseconds from the first sign of anomalous data to the loss of the second stage, followed by loss of the vehicle. Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.

The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.

Each stage of Falcon 9 uses COPVs to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure, and each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap. The recovered COPVs showed buckles in their liners. Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail. In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.

The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.

SpaceX is targeting return to flight from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) with the Iridium NEXT launch on January 8. SpaceX greatly appreciates the support of our customers and partners throughout this process, and we look forward to fulfilling our manifest in 2017 and beyond.

2432042510,"India stock market failed to surpass 2015 high of 9119 and drifted towards 6825 mark just before the Union Budget 2016. Going forward as market failed to deliver major gains in the last year, so potential of performance is rising in equity market amid big-bang reform by the government. We look at stocks to watch out for in 2017.

The company plans to launch new products and improve coverage of the existing products by penetrating into Tier-II cities and the rural markets. It expects to improve productivity index without any expansion in the field force (current 1000 MRs). Further, increased registrations in the contrast media segment are likely to rev up growth in the ensuing quarters. We expect sustained growth in India led by focused portfolio (chronic) over FY2017-18E;

The new capex plan of about Rs 140 crore is being incurred for the creation of additional capacity for the formulations business including tablets, liquid, ointments, vials, eye drops and lozeges and for the creation of additional capacity for the API business is progressing well.

As per the latest results and also based on its FY2016, we estimate its net cash level (net of debt) at over Rs 315 crore. Net of cash, JB Chem trades at EV (Enterprise Value) to annualized sales of 2.2x, which is quite attractive as compared to many small pharma companies which trade more than 3 times its annualized sales.

The company accords high priority to domestic formulations business almost 37% of the total revenue is derived from the domestic formulation business. During the current year, the company also plans to continue to pursue focus on harnessing potential of the existing products, launch new line extensions and achieve increased productivity. The stock currently trades at attractive valuation of 12.6x its FY2018E EPS of Rs.27. Its business would be relatively least impacted by the demonetization. Hence, we continue to recommend a buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 440.

Polaris Consulting

The stock price of Polaris has got corrected by 8 percent in the last 1 month and is down by 30% from its 52 week high of Rs 217. The promoters made an offer-for-sale (OFS) of 18.9 lakh equity shares at a floor price of Rs.130 per share and still have a greenshoe option of another 18.9 lakh shares.

It is quite surprising to us to see Virtusa (new promoter) making an Offer to sell shares at Rs.130 per share when they had earlier acquired the shares at an average price of Rs.213.88 per share in an open offer. In the last 3 years, the stock price of Polaris became highly volatile - however, we have observed that those investors, who utilized the opportunity to accumulate the stock after substantial fall in its price, could make impressive returns. Considering the attractive valuation, we believe that the price correction gives an opportunity to accumulate the stock in phases.

We believe that OFS does not change the fundamentals of the company. The current OFS was made to meet the minimum public shareholding norm. According to SEBI norm, all listed companies should have minimum public shareholding of 25%. As of September 30, 2016, the promoters held 78.61% stake in the company.

The stock trades at 0.6x its EV to H1FY2016 Annualized Sales which is quite impressive as compared to many mid and small cap IT stocks. The stock at the current market price trades at 8.8x its FY2017E EPS of Rs.17 and at 7.2x its FY2018E EPS of Rs.21. We reiterate our BUY on the stock at the current market price with a target price of Rs 186.

Bharti Infratel

Tower is emerging a precious resource in this country and this business model is akin to rental revenue stream of real estate - these tower rentals will keep on rising over the years in future. Hence, this stock would remain as one of the safest defensive stocks in the long-term;

The stock price of Bharti Infratel has got corrected by 9% in the last one month. We believe that this correction is an opportunity to accumulate the stock at the current market price as we believe that Bharti Infratel will relatively remain least affected by demonetization as most of its clients are institutions where transactions through cash are almost NIL Hence revenues won't be affected by under recoveries or fall in revenues.

In our view, Bharti Infratel, with a 20 percent share of towers in India, pan-India coverage (>95% of the population) with a tenancy of 2.2x, and leading telcos as incumbent tenants for its consolidated tower portfolio, remains well entrenched to capitalize on the data-growth led network capacity requirement of telcos.

Bharti Infratel has reported an impressive performance during the September 2016 quarter:

Net profit for the quarter grew by 31% y-o-y to Rs 774 crore whereas consolidated revenues for the quarter grew by 8% y-o-y. EBITDA for the quarter grew by 30% y-o-y to Rs 401.3 crore;

The Operating free cash flow during the quarter was Rs.932.1 crore, an increase of 30.4% as compared to the quarter ended Sep 30, 2015 led by higher operating income;

Infratel remains a key play on rising demand of telecom towers emanating from ballooning data growth and opportunity owing to the huge quantum of spectrum and its subsequent roll out. We reiterate a BUY on the stock with a target price of Rs.405, based on 26x its FY2018E EPS of Rs.15.3.

{blurb}

KCP Sugars

The stock price of KCP Sugar and Industries has got corrected by around 33% from its peak. The fundamentals of KCP Sugar haven't changed to such an extent to warrant such a steep fall in the stock price.

As of September 30, 2016, KCP Sugar's net debt is just 7.5% of total capital employed (Net Debt: Rs 24 crore and Capital Employed: Rs 318 crore). While many sugar mills finance 3/4th of sugar inventories through borrowed capital, KCP Sugar finances 3/4th of them through own funds;

We expect the domestic sugar price to remain firm on account of lower production in Maharashtra and Karnataka on account of cane scarcity. Though prices are down from their recent peak, sugar prices are up by 26% on y-o-y basis.

KCP Sugar has around surplus land on Mount Road in Chennai which is, in our view, significantly higher (in value) than the companies' market cap of about Rs.330 crore. Apart from this, the company owns several residential properties in Chennai, Hyderabad and Industrial site with buildings in Industrial Estate TADA, Andhra Pradesh. The company has also invested in the equities of other leading sugar mills and corporate.

At the current market price the stock trades at 7.3x its FY2018E EPS of Rs 4.20.

We believe that the stock can easily reach our target price of Rs 45/ and in the long run this stock is a potential multi bagger, if it could unlock value from its surplus land bank.

Axis Bank

Axis Bank's Q2 FY2017 performance was quite below our expectations as dismal asset quality (multi-fold rise in slippages) took the sheen off an otherwise operationally stable Q2FY2017. However, we suggest a BUY on the stock as:

a. The stock price has fallen 26% from its 52-week high which, in our view, largely priced in recent spike in non-performing assets;

b. The bank has become cheapest stock among its peers after the recent correction;

c. We believe that, within a couple of quarters, it is likely to stabilize the NPAs;

d. Bank continues to grow its credit base about two-times the industry credit growth - hence, we believe that the current price is fairly a rock bottom for the stock;

Advances continued to grow above industry average-up 18.5% yoy (albeit, lower than run rate of 22% over past 6 quarters). The spurt was largely due to healthy momentum in retail. The retail piece (including retail agriculture segment) continued to clock good performance (up 25% yoy) across segments, with higher growth in auto loans (up 41% yoy) and high-return businesses like personal loans and credit cards (up 50% yoy).

Focused branch network strategy has helped Axis garner steady accretion in the retail segment.

Management highlighted that the bank will continue to focus on higher-return businesses and expects these segments to remain on growth path. Corporate and SME loans also clocked healthy growth of 14.1% yoy and 14.4% y-o-y, respectively.

Management expects loan growth to be in the 18-20% range, driven by the retail segment. The bank at the current market price trades at 1.8x its FY2018E adjustable book value of Rs 254.

We continue to reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock at the current market price with a revised target price of Rs 625 looking at the banks attractive valuation and its strong core business and rapidly growing franchise business.

Lupin

Lupin has received 7 ANDA approvals in last two months and 23 ANDA approvals from USFDA till date in FY2017 (including tentative approvals). The approval pace has picked up after receiving EIR (Establishment Inspection Report) for its Goa plant from USFDA. The approval pace would continue in coming quarters as well, considering strong pipeline of 142 ANDAs pending approval (as per Q2FY2017 results press release) including 45 FTFs.

US: Getting ready to take-off

With $915 million revenues in FY2016, Lupin is the fifth largest generic company in the US by prescription. It has grown at 16-17% CAGR over the past five years and is likely to grow over 20% CAGR over the next two years. With 142 filings, the company has one of the largest ANDA pipelines among Indian peers. Pending filings and additional 250 projects under development represents a market size of $ 70 billion for the company;

India: Robust and Growing...

From being the largest supplier of anti-TB products in India to becoming one of the fastest growing companies in chronic therapies (like CVS, anti-diabetic, respiratory and CNS), Lupin has come a long way. Currently, it ranks 8th in the Indian pharma market, according to the July AIOCD data. Lupin continues to rank first in TB products (53% market share) and third in CVS and respiratory therapies.

We believe the long-term growth outlook for Lupin remains strong and we expect the company to regain premium multiples (vs. peers) with pick up in US approvals. We value Lupin at 22.6x its FY2018E EPS of Rs 85.4 and reiterate our BUY on the stock at a current price of Rs 1,483 with a target price of Rs 1930.

Tata Sponge

Globally precious and base metal prices have rallied anywhere between 85% to 7% YTD with Iron Ore gaining the most amid a broad rally in commodities on expectations of a pick-up in global manufacturing and infrastructure spending. Following the global trend domestic prices have also rallied - with sponge iron prices gaining 36% from its May 2016 lows and gaining 9% in last 2 weeks. We believe that this rise in the domestic sponge iron prices will improve Tata Sponge Iron's performance in the coming quarters.

The stock has got corrected by around 18% from its 52W High of Rs.685 and trades at attractive valuations of 13.4x its FY2017E EPS of Rs.42 and at 9.4x its FY2018E EPS of Rs.60. Its Net Cash as of September quarter stands at Rs.522 crore which is ~60% of the current market cap.

For Q2FY2017, the company reported an over two-fold jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs.16.06 crore for the quarter ended September 30. The company had clocked a net profit of Rs 5.70 crore in the year-ago period. The company reported an operating profit of Rs.13.67 crore as compared to a loss of Rs1.99 crore reported in the same quarter last year whereas qoq it grew over 2 fold from Rs.5.10 crore reported in the previous quarter. Total consolidated income of the company, however, fell by 8% to Rs.153.55 crore in the July-September quarter from Rs.167.51 crore during the same quarter in 2015-16;

The company has also zero debt status and high cash balances, which makes its balance sheet stronger. At CMP of Rs.563 the stock is trading at 9.4x its FY2018E EPS of Rs 60/. We firmly believe that the prospects of sponge iron industry would improve substantially and hence, we reiterate our 'BUY' on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 730/-.

Bombay Burmah Trading Company

The stock price of BBTC has got corrected by around 10% in last 3 months and is down by around 24% from its 52W High of Rs.673 and trades around Rs.510 which is quite attractive. Consequent to this correction the valuation discount to its investment in Britannia has expanded to 79% vs. a 70% discount earlier. While the Enterprise Value of BBTC stands at Rs 3,684 crore, the market value of its investments in Britannia is at whopping level of Rs.17,520 crore (i.e. 50.75% of Britannia's market cap of Rs 34,524 crore). This results in BBTC's Enterprise Value being at about 79% discount to its investment value in Britannia! Many holding companies enjoy discount to enterprise value as low as 45% to 50%. We firmly believe that BBTC deserves much lower discount to its investment value.

The predominant portion (almost 95%) of BBTC's total investment value comes from a single company i.e. Britannia. For many other holding companies, generally they come from several group companies - theoretically speaking, unlocking possibility from a single investment is more than what one would think of from several group companies;

While many holding companies are shell companies on standalone basis, BBTC has diverse businesses on its own like plantations and automobile components. Further, being a 150-year old company it holds a lot of surplus land bank;

Moreover, BBTC, on consolidated earnings, trade at 9.3x FY2016 EPS of Rs 55/. Hence, we suggest our short term and long terms investors to accumulate the stock with a target price of Rs 650/- for short term, while our long term target price of Rs 1,130 remains intact. This target price is highly conservative in our view as at this target price also, BBTC offers a discount of 79% to its investment value of Britannia holding.

2432049526,"Airbus will Internet aus dem All anbieten

Was Airbus in einer Fabrik in Florida vorhat, ist eine Revolution für das Satellitengeschäft des europäischen Luftfahrtriesen. ""Bislang haben wir in guten Jahren nicht mehr als zehn Satelliten gebaut"", resümiert Airbus-Raumfahrt-Chef Nicolas Chamussy. ""Hier werden wir zwei Satelliten am Tag liefern.""

Serienfertigung
Für das ehrgeizige Projekt OneWeb, das mit einer Flotte aus 648 Kleinsatelliten rund um den Globus schnelles Internet anbieten will, soll Weltraum-High-Tech in die Serienfertigung gehen. Es ist ein Beispiel dafür, wie Airbus im Raumfahrtgeschäft neue Wege geht, um seinen Platz gegen aufstrebende neue Konkurrenz zu behaupten.

Denn das Geschäft mit Raketen und Satelliten ist seit einigen Jahren in einem spektakulären Umbruch. Neue Akteure wie der schillernde US-amerikanische Unternehmer Elon Musk mit seiner Firma SpaceX haben die Regeln der Sparte durcheinandergewirbelt. Sie drücken die Preise für Trägerraketen und machen Schlagzeilen mit hochfliegenden Zielen wie der Besiedlung des Mars. Im Satellitenmarkt öffnen kostengünstige Kleinsatelliten die Tür für neue Anbieter.

Umdenken in Europa
Europas etablierter Raumfahrtsektor muss umdenken: ""Wir Europäer haben eine Tendenz, vorsichtiger zu sein, vielleicht nicht risikofreudig genug"", sagt Chamussy im Interview der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. ""Aber die Dinge ändern sich.""
So hat Europa nach zähen Verhandlungen sein Trägerraketengeschäft völlig neu sortiert. Die neue, günstigere Rakete Ariane 6 soll 2020 das erste Mal fliegen. ""Die Umstrukturierung des gesamten Trägerraketensektors war ein harter Kampf"", sagt Chamussy. ""Die Struktur war nicht effizient genug, um gegen SpaceX und andere anzukommen - aber es war ein riskanter Schritt, das komplett umzubauen."" Ob das reicht, um die Falcon 9 von SpaceX zu schlagen? ""Wir werden sehen, aber wir tun alles dafür."" Ariane 6 sei auf einem guten Weg, ""aber wir dürfen davon nicht abweichen"".
Denn die Wettbewerber bereiten ebenfalls neue Raketen vor: ""Wir zählen weltweit ein Dutzend Projekte für Trägerraketen vom Typ Ariane 6 (...) und etwa 50 Projekte für kleine Trägerraketen"", erläuterte der Chef von Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL), Alain Charmeau, der französischen Zeitung ""Le Figaro"". Der Chef des europäischen Raketenbetreibers Arianespace, Stephane Israel, warnte: ""Die Konkurrenz wird nicht abnehmen.""

Internet für alle
Vorzeigeprojekt für Airbus' Versuch, im sogenannten New Space mitzumischen, ist OneWeb, hinter dem der Internetpionier Greg Wyler steht. Airbus hat mit OneWeb vor einem Jahr ein Joint Venture gegründet. Ziel ist bezahlbares Highspeed-Internet auch für abgelegene Gebiete. Ob sich der Traum des ""Internet für alle"" auch als Geschäftsmodell rechnet, muss sich aber erst zeigen.
""Für uns war das etwas Neues - wir gehen eine Wette ein"", sagte Chamussy. ""Eine reflektierte Wette natürlich, wir investieren in ein Projekt, das wir für die richtige Initiative halten."" Der erste Start ist für das erste Halbjahr 2018 geplant. ""Die Entwicklung läuft gut, wir haben fast alle Zulieferer ausgewählt."" Konkurrent auch hier: SpaceX-Gründer Musk, der mit Unterstützung von Google an einem ähnlichen Internet-Projekt aus 4.000 Satelliten arbeitet.

Satelliten-Boom
Wegen dieser Vorhaben erwartet das Beratungsunternehmen Euroconsult, dass von 2016 bis 2025 sage und schreibe 9.000 Satelliten ins All gebracht werden - gegenüber 1.480 im vorherigen Jahrzehnt. Auch wenn man Kleinstsatelliten herausrechnet, gehen die Experten davon aus, dass die Zahl der ins All geschossenen Himmelskörper um mehr als 50 Prozent zulegt. Der Markt für die Hersteller könnte demnach trotz des erwarteten Preisverfalls um 16 Prozent wachsen, der für Raketenstarts um 18 Prozent. Insgesamt erwartet Euroconsult für diesen Zeitraum einen Satelliten-Branchenumsatz von 280 Mrd. US-Dollar (266 Mrd. Euro) - mehr als drei Viertel davon für öffentliche Aufträge.

Weil das Raumfahrtgeschäft floriert, hat Airbus in diesem Bereich in den vergangenen beiden Jahren jeweils 1.000 Mitarbeiter eingestellt. ""Und wir streben für 2017 weitere 1.000 an"", sagt Chamussy. Der Bereich gehört zur Sparte Defence and Space mit rund 38.000 Mitarbeitern Ende 2015. Wie viele davon im Raumfahrtgeschäft arbeiten, schlüsselt Airbus nicht auf - nach Einschätzung von Branchenkennern ist es etwa ein Drittel.
Chamussy sieht in der neuen Raumfahrt-Welt für Airbus eine Notwendigkeit nach mehr Risikofreude und Beweglichkeit. 

Für OneWeb habe das Unternehmen etwa seine Arbeitsabläufe verändert, um die Entwicklung des Satelliten-Designs zu beschleunigen. Allerdings gebe es Unterschiede - technisch anspruchsvolle Großprojekte wie die europäische Antriebs- und Versorgungseinheit für die NASA-Raumkapsel Orion könnten nicht nach dem gleichen Schema laufen wie die Serienfertigung von Kleinsatelliten. ""Deshalb müssen wir vorsichtig sein, nicht vollständig von einer Seite auf die andere zu wechseln."""
2432049647,"A 404 error is a destination we never want to reach. It's an internet dead end, a webpage road block, perhaps an error message from a broken link that never ascended to Web 2.0.

For many creative types, though, a 404 error is an opportunity. It's still a webpage, right, may as well use it for something? If you've ever been lucky enough to chance upon a broken link on Motherboard, you would have arrived at our own magnificent offering of a 404 error: Filly . For Motherboard, Filly represents not a dead end but a new beginning.

""Every time I feel like I cannot continue on in this sick sad world I look at that majestic beast and its inexhaustible canter into the future and everything becomes sane again,"" Motherboard Editor-in-Chief Derek Mead said, describing Filly to me over Slack this week.

So towards the end of this truly bizarre year, Filly, and Motherboard, is proud to be part of a new curatorial project that applauds the true meaning of a 404 error. The 404error.gallery , a collaboration between Matthew Britton, an artist and lecturer and the University of South Wales, and friend Brett O'Connor, celebrates the potential of the 404's non-space on the internet, featuring a collection of imaginative 404s created by artists.

""I like to think of ways of subverting these every day online things that we take for granted, the mundane and the overlooked,"" Britton told Motherboard over email.

Previously, Britton has turned out of office auto replies into art distributors, in the form of email addresses assigned to business cards . He's also taken a single Google Doc and invited the internet to come and make art with him.

""These collaborative tools can be thought about in novel and more interesting ways,"" he said. ""So with www.404error.gallery I really wanted these spaces of disappointment on the internet-these spaces where content couldn't be found-to be filled with creative potential and to imagine how the overlooked could be interpreted by creative minds.""

Britton teamed up with Brett O'Connor and gave artists a week to respond to the concept of designing a 404 error page. The artist replies are now part of the ongoing archive at the 404error gallery online and there's 17 ace designs so far.

""It began as a kind of cool idea for an online show,"" said Britton. ""It was more of a statement that no space on the web should be overlooked for its creative potential. I like to put ideas for projects out into the world and see how the world responds, see if it can engage an audience and make them think differently about their everyday routine.""

Naturally, we had to ask Britton, obviously a respected custodian of 404 error pages, what he thought of our Filly. ""I do love the 404 horse, I could watch he/she all day. But I've never been overly fond of horses, so that should say something. It's more than a horse for me.""

She's more than a horse to all of us, Matthew.

2432052683,"SPACEX ANOMALY UPDATE AND RETURN TO FLIGHT PLANS:

Over the past four months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Air Force (USAF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), along with several industry experts, have collaborated with SpaceX on a rigorous investigation to determine the cause of the anomaly that occurred September 1 at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This investigation team was established according to SpaceX's accident investigation plan as approved by the FAA. As the primary federal licensing body, the FAA provided oversight and coordination for the investigation.

Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events - there were just 93 milliseconds from the first sign of anomalous data to the loss of the second stage, followed by loss of the vehicle. Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.

The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.

Each stage of Falcon 9 uses COPVs to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure, and each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap. The recovered COPVs showed buckles in their liners. Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail. In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.

The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.​

SpaceX is targeting return to flight from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) with the Iridium NEXT launch on January 8. SpaceX greatly appreciates the support of our customers and partners throughout this process, and we look forward to fulfilling our manifest in 2017 and beyond."

2432054883,"NEWARK, N.J. - An upscale New Jersey town violated anti-discrimination laws by insisting that a proposed mosque have more parking spaces than churches or synagogues because of its unique worship times and traditions, a federal judge has ruled.

The ruling issued Saturday by U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp stated that Bernards Township violated the Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act by applying a different standard to Muslims.

Shipp found the township's planning board had ""unbridled and unconstitutional discretion"" because of its vague parking requirements.

The Islamic Society's application to build the mosque was denied after more than three years and 39 public hearings. The group sued the township in March. The Islamic Society's attorney, Adeel Mangi, had argued that parking requirements were the tool municipalities used to thwart construction of mosques.

""This truly is a landmark ruling with national impact,"" Mangi told NJ.com.

Bernards Mayor Carol Bianchi issued a statement criticizing the judge's ruling. The town had argued that it was completely appropriate to insist a mosque provide more off-street parking than a comparably sized church or synagogue because of its unique worship times and traditions.

""The Township vehemently disagrees with the court's decision and awaits a full analysis of the 57-page decision by its attorneys, who only learned of the decision on New Year's Day,"" the statement said. ""The Township will consider how to best move forward including appealing the decision when ripe for appeal.""

The mosque has said its peak worship time was likely Friday afternoon prayers. Township planners determined that because congregants would most likely be arriving straight from work, every worshipper would require a parking space.

Shipp, though, noted that the township had not conducted individual assessments of worship habits when churches or synagogues came before its boards. By its own admission, the town applied a different standard to Muslims, he wrote.

Shipp did not take into account the sentiments expressed in emails from township officials that were revealed in documents filed in the case, Mangi noted. In those, officials disparaged the Islamic Society's president, former mayor Mohammed Ali Chaudry, and passed around jokes calling President Barack Obama a Muslim.

2432060592,"A day after closing out their 2016 season, Broncos players arrived at the team's Englewood headquarters to clean out their lockers, turn in their playbooks and prepare for an offseason of change. Many will return in a few months to new teammates and new coaches. Others will bid farewell.

This is the way of the NFL. This is especially the way of a team that failed to make the postseason and whose head coach resigned.

The Broncos' encore to their Super Bowl title ended with a 9-7 record, keeping them out of the postseason for the first time since 2010. The season finale against the Raiders on Sunday offered one final audition before general manager John Elway started to retool.

As the offseason officially gets underway for the Broncos, here's a primer on what lies ahead:

KEY DATES

(Player contract information via Spotrac, Overthecap and The Denver Post )

Jan. 2-May 3 : The Broncos can extend or exercise the fifth-year contract option on cornerback Bradley Roby, their 2014 first-round draft pick (No. 31). Fifth-year option salaries differ depending on the player's draft slot and position. For players drafted Nos. 11-32, like Roby, the salary is the average of the third- through 25th-highest salaries at a player's position. Last year, the fifth-year salary for a cornerback chosen No. 11-32 was $8.026 million. The option is guaranteed for injury and becomes fully guaranteed once the fifth contract year begins (in March 2018 for Roby).

Jan. 8-9 : Assistant coaches of playoff teams that have first-round byes can be interviewed for head-coaching positions through the end of the wild-card games.

Jan. 10 : Coaches of nonplayoff teams can begin to discuss employment if their contracts are set to expire.

Jan. 15 : Assistant coaches of playoff teams that won their wild-card games can be interviewed for head-coaching positions through the end of the divisional playoffs.

Jan. 28 : Senior Bowl at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama

Jan. 29 : An assistant whose team is in Super Bowl LI and who had an interview for a another team's head-coaching job can have a second interview with that team no later than the Sunday preceding the Super Bowl.

Jan. 29 : NFL Pro Bowl at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. Three Broncos players were selected: Cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, and outside linebacker Von Miller. If the three play and are on the winning team, they each receive $61,000. If they lose, they get $30,000.

Feb. 5 : Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium in Houston.

Feb. 6 : Waiver system begins for 2017.

Feb. 15-March 1 : Teams can designate franchise or transition players. Franchise tags are fully guaranteed one-year deals with set salaries based on a player's position. Teams can designate one franchise or transition player. The deadline to designate one is 2 p.m. on March 1.

Feb. 28-March 6 : NFL scouting combine at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

March 7-9 : Free-agent negotiation period. Teams can open talks with certified agents of players who will be unrestricted free agents.

March 9 : The 2017 league year and free-agency period begin at 2 p.m., meaning any agreed-upon deals during the negotiation period can be signed. The trading period for 2017 also begins at 2 p.m. Prior to 2 p.m. teams must:

• Exercise options for 2017 for all players that have options in the contracts and submit qualifying offers to restricted free agents with expiring contracts.

• Submit minimum salary tender to exclusive rights free agents with expiring 2016 contracts

• Be under the 2017 salary cap, projected to be between $163 million and $165 million, according to ESPN.

March 9 : Deadline for the Broncos to exercise LT Russell Okung's $1 million option for 2017. If exercised, Okung's $2 million base salary for 2017, $9.5 million base salary for 2018 and $8 million roster bonus all become fully guaranteed, for a payout of $19.5 million. He can also earn up to $1.5 million in per-game roster bonuses.

March 13 : OT Donald Stephenson's $4 million salary becomes fully guaranteed. Stephenson has a $5 million cap hit for 2017 with $2 million in dead money if released, which means the Broncos would save $3 million in cap space if he's cut before this deadline.

April 3 : Teams that hired a new head coach can begin offseason workouts.

April 21 : Deadline for restricted free agents to sign offer sheets.

April 27-29 : 2017 NFL draft in Philadelphia.

July 15 : Teams must sign franchise players to a multiyear deal or extension by 2 p.m. After the deadline, players may sign only the one-year franchise contract in order to play in 2017.

Mid-July : Training camps open.

2432062200,"Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., Stratford, Connecticut, a Lockheed Martin company, has been awarded a $35,708,378 other transaction (for prototype project agreement for Phase III of the Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program.

The goal of the ALIAS program is to create an easily installable/removable kit that is extensible across 80 percent of Department of Defense aircraft and some commercial aircraft, which automates co-piloting functions to enable reduced crew operations.

Phase III focuses on the fabrication and installation of the prototype ALIAS kits on multiple aircraft types for flight demonstrations of each.

The estimated government funding for the agreement is $21,300,000, and the Sikorsky cost share is $14,408,378.

Work will be performed in Stratford, Connecticut (93 percent); Westford, Massachusetts (3 percent); Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1 percent); Orlando, Florida (1 percent); Canton, Connecticut (1 percent); and East Hartford, Connecticut (1 percent).

The estimated completion date is February 2018. Fiscal 2016 and 2017 research and development funds in the amount of $3,004,285 are being obligated at time of award.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Arlington, Virginia, is the contracting activity (HR0011-17-9-0004).

Building on recent successes, program aims to enhance prototype's ability to decrease pilot workload, respond to airborne difficulties, and adapt to different missions and aircraft types.

DARPA's Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program envisions flight operations with reduced onboard aircrew while improving mission performance and flight safety-all through a tailorable, drop-in, removable kit that would provide advanced automation to existing aircraft. In two important steps toward that goal, DARPA has recently completed Phase 2 of this development effort and has decided to partner on Phase 3 of ALIAS with Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (Stratford, Conn.).

ALIAS' Phase 2 accomplishments included:

--Successful flight demonstrations of ALIAS technology installed in two different Cessna 208 Caravan fixed-wing aircraft, a Diamond DA-42 fixed-wing aircraft, and a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter

--Successful ground demonstrations of ALIAS responding to various simulated flight contingency events, such as system failures, that might cause pilots to deviate from pre-set plans or standard courses of action

--Demonstration of quickly tailoring ALIAS to new platforms, and showing that installation and removal of the kit did not impact airworthiness

Sikorsky's Phase 2 demonstration system fits under the cabin floor and within the airframe of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The system quickly connects to an aircraft's existing mechanical, electrical, and diagnostic systems. Through ALIAS, the pilot flies the aircraft by means of a tablet computer that recognizes familiar gestures such as swiping and tapping. Pilots can use the same tablet to fly ALIAS-equipped airplanes and helicopters.

""In Phase 2, we exceeded our original program objectives with two performers, Sikorsky and Aurora Flight Sciences, each of which conducted flight tests on two different aircraft,"" said Scott Wierzbanowski, DARPA program manager. ""In Phase 3, we plan to further enhance ALIAS' ability to respond to contingencies, decrease pilot workload, and adapt to different missions and aircraft types.

""We're particularly interested in exploring intuitive human-machine interface approaches-including using handheld devices-that would allow users to interact with and control the ALIAS system more easily. Ultimately, we want to design for and demonstrate the improved ALIAS system across as many as seven previously untested fixed- and rotary-wing platforms.""

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy have all expressed interest in ALIAS' potential capabilities and are providing support to the program. These stakeholders and DARPA intend to continue working closely with the commercial and government aerospace community to identify potential transition opportunities for ALIAS technology.

2432062281,"Saying goodbye: the IAF parts from the ""Netz"" (F-16A/B) jets that are completing their service in the IAF after 36 years of operational activity. In a ceremony that took place in Ouvda AFB, the engines of the first F-16 aircraft in the IAF were shut off, leaving behind operational achievements, great knowledge and countless memories. ""Moments ago, the 'Netz' landed from its last flight after 36 years of flight"", said Col. Itamar, Ouvda AFB Commander. ""Today, we say goodbye to an incredible aircraft that seems to have been created by an artist, an aircraft that fits its missions like a glove"".

""Today, we sign the last chapter of the 'Netz' aircraft in the IAF"", added Lt. Col. Udi, the ""Flying Dragon"" Squadron Commander that has been flying the aircraft in its final years. ""Only those who have touched the aircraft, only those who have been touched by the aircraft, know that the 'Netz' is not just an object - it has a soul"".

The aircraft that changed the Middle East

The first four ""Netz"" aircraft landed in Ramat David AFB on July 2, 1980. A few months after their arrival, it already had a significant achievement to its name: the aircraft's first shut down in the world. The historic shut down took place in April, 1981, when Brig. Gen. (Res.) Rafi Berkovitch shot down a Syrian Mil-Mi 8 helicopter.

Since that shut down and to this day, the ""Netz"" has conducted countless missions and partook in many operations; the 2006 Second Lebanon War, 1996 Operation ""Grapes of Wrath"", 2008 Operation ""Cast Lead"", 2002 Operation ""Pillar of Defense"" and 2014 Operation ""Protective Edge"" being just part of the operations the ""Netz"" took part in. In fact, during its years of activity, the aircraft has conducted 474,000 sorties and 335,000 flight hours. ""In the history books, the 'Netz' will be written as the aircraft that changed the face of the Middle East"", stated Brig.-Gen. Amir Eshel, IAF Commander, in the ceremony.

""A strategic achievement that will stay for generations""

The most known sortie by the ""Netz"" is the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor during 1981 Operation ""Opera"", that symbolized a significant milestone in the aircraft's activity and for the IAF. In an interview with the IAF Magazine, Maj.-Gen. (Res.) Amos Yadlin, then Deputy Commander of the F-16 Squadron and one of the eight combat pilots that took part in the operation, shared: ""The nuclear reactor was protected by SAM batteries that were brought there after the Iranians tried attacking it in January, 1981. The IAF had never flown such a far distance and the last 'leg' was in a flat zone filled with high voltage poles in which the Iraqi Aerial Defense forces could easily discover us"".

Despite the difficulty, it is clear that the attack on the nuclear reactor was one of the most impressive achievements in IAF history. ""I believe that this operation is proof of Israel's need of a strong and quality, creative and daring air force"", added Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Yadlin. ""This is an example of how one tactical sortie of eight attack aircraft and six interception aircraft, could achieve a strategic change that will remain valid for generations to come"".

Training the future generation

Alongside the successful operational work the ""Netz"" is credited for, one cannot forget its activity in the training fields: IAF Servicemen consider it simple and comfortable to fly. The ""Netz"" aircraft have a resume that also include training combat pilots and WSO's in the Combat Training Course and Advanced Combat Training Course, which the aircrews complete at the end of their pilots course.

Today, the ""Lavi"" (M-346) aircraft that landed in Israel two years ago and has entered service in Flight Academy and the

Flying Tiger"" Squadron near Hatzerim AFB will take the ""Netz's"" place as a combat training aircraft. ""Since 2000, 'Barak' (F-16C/D) and 'Raam' (F-15I) and 'Sufa' (F-16I) take part in most of the operational activity in the IAF"", explains Lt. Col. Udi. ""The 'Netz' took a step back in its operational activity but found a way to continue giving - it trained the next generation of pilots"".

Parting hour

The ""Flying Falcon"" may be completing its service, however it seems it will have a lasting influence for many more years as it seems those who learned from and flew the aircraft will be continuing their service in the IAF. Maj. Itzik: ""We are a few people, with few means, but with so many accomplishments and so much work"".

2432079491,"Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - Rioting inmates in Brazil decapitated and brutally assaulted their rivals, killing at least 60, when fighting erupted between two gangs at a prison in the Amazon region, officials said Monday.

The 17-hour riot broke out Sunday afternoon and lasted through the night at a prison on the outskirts of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, said state public security secretary Sergio Fontes.

He called it ""the biggest massacre"" ever committed at a prison in the state.

Police were only able to restore order on Monday morning, freeing 12 guards who had been taken hostage, he said.

They found a horrific scene inside the Anisio Jobim correctional center.

""Many (victims) were decapitated, and they all suffered a lot of violence,"" Fontes told a press conference.

He said the gruesome scene appeared aimed at sending a message from the Family of the North (FDN), a powerful local gang, to rivals from the First Capital Command (PCC), one of Brazil's largest gangs, whose base is in Sao Paulo, some 2,700 kilometers (1,650 miles) to the southeast.

""During the negotiations (to end the riot), the prisoners had almost no demands. Their only request was not to be mistreated by the police when they came in,"" Fontes told local radio network Tiradentes.

""We think they had already done what they wanted: kill members of the rival organization and get a guarantee that they would not be beaten by the police. The FDN massacred suspected members of the PCC and other rivals.""

Authorities have counted 60 bodies so far, all of them inmates, the head of the state's prisons administration, Pedro Florencio, told journalists.

Officials said they were working to determine whether any prisoners had escaped.

- Overcrowded, underfunded -

It was the latest eruption of horrific violence to hit Brazil's underfunded and overcrowded prisons.

In October, deadly riots broke out at three separate prisons blamed on fighting between members of the country's two largest gangs, the PCC and the Red Command (CV).

During that episode, rioting inmates took visitors hostage, beheaded rivals and burned others alive, authorities said. At least 25 inmates were killed at one prison, in Roraima state.

Brazil's prisons are often under the de facto control of drug gangs, whose turf wars on the outside are also fought out among inmates.

""Fighting between different criminal factions occurs all over Brazil, in every penitentiary,"" said Florencio.

Some 622,000 people were imprisoned in Brazil as of the end of 2014, most of them black males, according to a justice ministry report.

That makes it the world's fourth-largest prison population, the report said, after the United States, China and Russia.

Human rights groups have long complained about the conditions in Brazilian prisons.

Brazil's prisons need 50 percent more capacity to handle the current number of inmates, the justice ministry report found.

There were 1.67 prisoners for every available space, it said. In Amazonas state, the figure was 2.59 prisoners for every space.

"
2432079494,"The second day of January is National Science Fiction Day , an unofficial holiday that corresponds with the official birthdate of Isaac Asimov , the enormously influential and prolific scientist and writer of science fiction.

The start of the new year is also a good moment to reflect on the future - an exercise familiar to both writers and readers of science fiction. But where New Year's resolutions typically extend over weeks or months, the imagined futures of science fiction usually unfold years or centuries from the present. Interstellar travel and space colonization, if they come at all, aren't coming in 2017.

But maybe Jan. 2 is a good moment to take a longer view. What do the possible futures of 2067, or 3017, mean for the decisions we ought to make today?

In an essay published in 1978, Isaac Asimov advocated for a ""science-fictional"" way of thinking, a way of thinking that should inform the decision-making of the present. He wrote :

""No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the word as it will be - and naturally this means that there must be an accurate perception of the world as it will be. This, in turn, means that our statesmen, our businessmen, our Everyman, must take on a science fictional way of thinking, whether he likes it or not or even whether he knows it or not. Only so can the deadly problems of today be solved.""

Article continues after sponsorship

The ""fictional"" in Asimov's ""science-fictional"" thinking shouldn't be misread. Asimov wasn't calling for baseless speculation, but for systematic and scientifically informed prediction - an appreciation for possible futures, all the while acknowledging their contingency on our current actions and the many uncertainties involved.

If this form of thinking is for Everyman (and Everywoman), what does it mean for us, in 2017?

Adopting a longer view helps clarify which problems merit special attention. New Year's resolutions are often focused on the self - with dieting and exercise topping many people's lists. But looking a century into the future can change that focus from the self to future generations. For me, that highlights climate change and inequality as deadly problems of today, and science and education as crucial long-term investments.

Science-fictional thinking isn't a reason to give up on dieting or exercise. But it might be a reason to consider a more ambitious set of resolutions for 2017 (and for 3017, too).

2432090799,"AKA ""Composting Toilet Hunters.""

Matt Stopera BuzzFeed Staff 1. Every episode starts with two people with wildly different ideas of what a tiny house is. Like how these people even together? 2. One person is always waaay too into it. 3. The other person is always not. 4. She's basically dying inside wondering what the hell she got herself into. 5. Then there's always some domestic shot of them cooking dinner or drinking wine in a perfectly okay apartment/house that they're going to abandon to live in a shack. 6. Again, she's dying inside. Like they are def. gonna break up because of this. 7. The person *really into* the tiny house always says it's going to be cheaper than their current life. I mean, duh. 8. Meanwhile, the other person questions their sanity. She's miserable. 9. Now let's look at some houses! *Dies slowly* Every episode of Tiny House Hunters has tiny houses that have the same few things: 10. There's always a tiny house with a loft space and a mattress on the floor. It's always ""bigger than they thought."" 11. There's always a bathroom without a door and the people always freak out. 12. And there's always, without fail, a composting toilet drama. 13. The composting toilet is the biggest point of contention in every episode of Tiny House Hunters. 14. They literally talk about composting toilets for half of every episode. 15. It's awful. Just get the toilet, she's already dying inside. Moving on! 16. Throughout every episode of Tiny House Hunters you'll hear over & over phrases like: ""Wow, this is small"" or ""I can't believe how small this is."" Like duh, you're on a fucking show about tiny houses. 17. You'll hear how they're ""unsure of the small size"" or wonder how ""all of their stuff will fit."" Again, you are on a show about fucking tiny houses. You guys got yourselves into this! 18. Then there's always a customizable house. 19. The customizable houses always seem too good to be true because they are exactly that. TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. 20. At first, the people on the show are always like ""Holy shit, this is amazing! It's cheap!"" 21. But that illusion of it being cheap goes away quickly. 22. Everything always ""adds up."" 23. Don't even get me started on the plot of land. 24. In the customizable houses, they always talk about getting a ladder. 25. The ladder is always a huge point of contention because really, who wants to climb a big ass ladder to go to bed? Anyway... 26. They look at a third house and blah blah blah surprise! It's so tiny. 27. There's always one house that's missing something major like a stove, sink, or some essential thing humans need for survival and shelter. We're almost there! 28. Tiny House Hunters episodes always end with the hunters drinking wine or beer. You always wonder how they're still together because they are basically complete opposites. They make their decision... 29. One house is always good because it's under budget but they basically hate it. 30. One house is always bad because it's over budget. 31. And one house is always bad because it's a *project* 32. It seems like all the houses are awful but they make a decision. Suddenly we're in the future and they're happy for the first time we've seen all episode. 33. Every episode ends with the couple doing something domestic like cooking corn over a fire. Somehow the compost toilet didn't tear them apart. THE END.

2432100614,"Crunch Network Some tweaks to build employee loyalty Posted 5 minutes ago by Daniel Zimmermann 0

SHARES Daniel Zimmermann Crunch Network Contributor Daniel Zimmermann navigates emerging companies and tech startups through complex corporate transactions, financings and venture technology matters. How to join the network Two years here. Three years there. Another five somewhere else. Frequent job-hopping used to be a red flag, suggesting to prospective employers that a candidate was unfocused and disloyal. That stigma seems to be gone. Changing jobs might be the best way to score a significant salary bump and move up the career ladder. And younger workers - the fuel driving every startup machine - are more likely than older ones to switch employers. Employees ages 25-34 had a median tenure of just 2.8 years on the job in January 2016, compared to 7.9 years for workers ages 45-54, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Concern about turnover is yet another worry that keeps founders and management up at night. They know their business success depends in large part on keeping a stable and productive team on the job for the long haul - or at least long enough to make it through a key milestone such as a product launch, a critical round of funding or an exit event. Stock options are a powerful incentive. But in this supercharged era of unicorns and staggering valuations, are they enough, particularly if you have no plans to go public anytime soon? This has been an abysmal year for IPOs as companies readily draw capital from the private market. In this climate, are you providing enough access to liquidity to keep your critical team from dusting off their resumes? Let's take a closer look at some of the vesting schedules and exercise periods that companies are debuting and weigh their risks and rewards. Typical The default for startups is a four-year vesting schedule. A quarter of the options vest after the first anniversary of the initial option grant - the ""one-year cliff"" - and then employees can begin to exercise them. After that, one forty-eighth (1/48) of the employee's shares vest each month for the remaining 36 months. After four years, the employee holds them all, and the options are fully vested. This schedule is a sweet deal for long-term, early hires because exercising options is feasible when the strike price is a bargain. These employees can exercise all their options for just a few hundred dollars. Those who join the team several years later, however, might not be so enthusiastic. If the strike price skyrockets, exercising those options can set an employee back tens of thousands of dollars - or more. Or perhaps the company is a unicorn, valued at 13 figures but, tantalizingly, privately held; there may be little or no liquidity. The biggest hitch, though, is that an employee can walk away at any time with a chunk of vested options. There's no significant upside to sticking around.

Back-loaded vesting The standard four-year vesting schedule, as described above, has been recently reimagined by companies, including Snapchat. Some of these schedules vest 10 percent of the shares after the employee's first year on the job. Another 20 percent are available after the second year. A worker gets another 30 percent on his third anniversary. And the big payoff - 40 percent - comes in the fourth year, rewarding loyalty right around the time when they might otherwise have been tempted to start a job search. Sell but stick around As part of Airbnb's recent refinancing, the room-rental business threw a tasty bone to employees with at least four years of tenure. It arranged for investors to buy about $200 million in common shares held by employees as part of an $850 million funding round. The goal, according to The Wall Street Journal, was to ""relieve some of the pressure to go public"" and ""give longer-term employees the option to get cash for some of their shares."" You might want to explore this option if your company, like Airbnb, is a glittery-maned rainbow unicorn valued at $30 billion. If it's not, you'll need to consider other strategies. Wait a decade Employees who leave a job get a tasty perk if they exercise their incentive stock options within 90 days of their last day: They maintain the coveted incentive stock option status, which allows them to kick down the road the tax liability on the spread - until they sell or otherwise unload the underlying vested stock. Otherwise, the stock options morph into non-qualified options, and exercising them can trigger costly capital gains. This isn't an issue for early, longer-term employees, but it can be a problem for later hires, who might need six figures to purchase their options and cover their tax liability. So how about extending the exercise period in a big way, from 90 days to 10 years? That would give workers (and former employees) much more time to amass enough cash to cover the options and taxes. I'm not a fan of this tactic, though. It encourages job-hopping - which founders would rather prevent - as workers bounce from one startup to the next, scooping up options along the way and hoping that one of these companies will strike it big and the options will then be worth exercising. To prevent this problem, Andreessen Horowitz's Scott Kupor suggests requiring a period of tenure to activate the 10-year window or implementing a sliding scale that ties length of the exercise period to number of years on the job. Both strategies enable founders to reward talent for sticking around. What to do? If your company has a high valuation and your stock options are flirting with a high strike price... congratulations. That's good news for your employees, too - or at least for those few who can cough up enough money to cash out their options. But to keep everyone else incentivized, it's time to explore some alternative vesting options. Your plan cannot operate retroactively, so you might face some pushback from longer-term employees. Explaining in detail that you want to reward loyalty and enable workers to exercise their options might help allay fears - and go a long way toward keeping your team loyal and engaged.

Share Just in time for new spinoff 'Rogue One,' we chronicle the Star Wars series in a two-minute timeline. Janet Loehrke, Ramon Padilla, Jim Sergent and Brian Truitt, USA TODAY Ben Mendelsohn stars as Imperial officer Director Orson Krennic in 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.'(Photo: Jonathan Olley) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story still dominates in 2017, taking the box office for a third weekend in a row.

Disney's $64.3 million four-day New Year's weekend haul for Rogue was enough to push the one-off Star Wars film to $439.7 million, which means it's only behind Disney/Pixar's Finding Dory (which has earned $486.3 million to date) as the highest-grossing film that opened in 2016.

Rogue's prequel tale of the Rebels who steal the plans for the Empire's Death Star weapon has earned worldwide total of $775 million with box-office heavyweight China yet to open.

The scenario is a near remake of one year ago, when Star Wars: The Force Awakens kept control of the box office on its way to $2 billion worldwide.

""It's the second straight year that a Star Wars film has owned New Year's,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the tracking service comScore. ""It's the irresistible gravitational pull of the brand, along with Rogue One just being a flat-out great movie.""

Animated musical comedy Sing, which boasts an all-star singing cast that includes Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon, belted out some power notes of its own, taking second place in its second weekend with $56.4 million ($180 million total). The movie enjoyed a rare increase from last weekend's four-day opening of $56.1 million.

""That shows an incredibly strong hold for this movie because word of mouth is hitting all the right notes,"" says Dergarabedian.

Passengers, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as stranded space travelers, took third place with $20.7 million ($66 million total). Animated hit Moana showed surprising strength at No. 4 with $14.3 million, for $213.4 million total since opening Thanksgiving weekend.

Rounding out the top five was the dysfunctional family holiday comedy Why Him? (starring James Franco and Bryan Cranston), which pulled in $13 million ($37.6 million total).

Awards contender Fences, directed by and starring Denzel Washington along with Viola Davis, continued to perform well over New Year's with $12.7 million, for $32.4 million total and sixth place overall.

Musical favorite La La Land danced to an impressive $12.3 million for the long holiday weekend. The film starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling finished seventh and has earned a powerful $37 million total before next weekend's Golden Globes Awards, where it leads the pack with seven nominations.

The Casey Affleck drama Manchester By the Sea finished No. 9 in the weekend's top 10, earning $5.5 million ($29.9 million total).

Final numbers are expected Tuesday.

2432106608,"By Alonso Soto

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Around 60 people were killed in a bloody prison riot in the Amazon jungle city of Manaus sparked by a war between rival drug gangs, officials said on Monday, in the worst violence in over two decades in Brazil's overcrowded penitentiary system.

The head of security for Amazonas state, Sergio Fontes, told a news conference that the death toll could rise as authorities get a clearer idea of the scale of the rebellion sparked by a fight between rival drug gangs.

Fontes told reporters that several of the dead had their decapitated bodies thrown over the prison wall - and that most of those killed came from one gang.

""This was another chapter in the silent and ruthless war of drug trafficking,"" he said.

Pedro Florencio, the Amazonas state prison secretary, said that the massacre was a ""revenge killing"" that formed part of an ongoing feud between criminal gangs in Brazil.

The riot began late Sunday and was brought under control by around 7 a.m. AMT (1100 GMT) on Monday, Fontes said. Authorities were still counting the prisoners to determine how many had escaped, he added, with reports that up to 300 fled.

Just as the riot began in one unit of the Anisio Jobim prison complex, dozens of prisoners in the second unit started a mass escape in what authorities said was a coordinated effort to distract guards.

Overcrowding is extremely common in Brazil's prisons, which suffer endemic violence and what rights groups call medieval conditions with cells so crowded prisoners have no space to lie down and food is scarce.

The Anisio Jobim prison complex currently houses 2,230 inmates despite having a capacity of only 590.

Watchdog groups sharply criticize Brazil for its prisons where deadly riots routinely break out.

""These massacres occur almost daily in Brazil,"" said Father Valdir Silveira, director of Pastoral Carceraria, a Catholic center that monitors prison conditions in Brazil. ""Our prisons were built to annihilate, torture and kill.""

The violence was the latest clash between inmates aligned with the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang, Brazil's most powerful, and a local Manaus criminal group known as the North Family.

The Manaus-based gang is widely believed to be attacking PCC inmates at the behest of the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command (CV) drug gang, Brazil's second largest.

Security analysts have said that a truce that held for years between the PCC and CV was broken last year, resulting in months of deadly prison battles between the gangs and sparking fears that chaos will spread to other prisons.

In the latest riot, a group of inmates exchanged gunfire with police and held 12 prison guards hostage late on Sunday in the largest prison in Manaus, an industrial city on the banks of the Amazon River, Globo TV reported.

Fontes said that 74 prisoners were taken hostage during the riot, with some executed and some released.

A video posted on the website of the Manaus-based newspaper Em Tempo showed dozens of bloodied and mutilated bodies piled atop each other on the prison floor as other inmates milled about.

Brazil's prison system is precariously overcrowded and conditions in many institutions are horrific. That has sparked a rash of deadly riots in recent years.

Sunday's riot was the deadliest in years. A 1992 rebellion at the Carandiru prison in Sao Paulo state saw 111 inmates killed, nearly all of them by police as they retook the jail.

Maria Canineu, director of Human Rights Watch for Brazil, said the most recent violence was the result of ""no government in 20 years giving much attention to the penitentiary system.""

Canineu said that for years it's been very difficult for states to receiving any funding help from the federal government for prisons.

President Michel Temer announced last week that the federal government would furnish states with 1.2 billion reais ($366 million), mostly to improve infrastructure and security in existing prisons and to build new ones.

($1 = 3.2744 reais)

Se trata del tren supersónico del futuro, mejor conocido como Hyperloop, el cual podría llevar sello español, ya que un equipo de la UPV trabaja en el que sería un prototipo cuyo objetivo principal es conectar las grandes capitales de europa en tal solo menos de 1 hora.
Tienen el firme objetivo de revolucionar el transporte. Y hasta el momento momento, nada ni nadie lo va a impedir (según lo que indica el equipo de expertos). Estamos hablando nada mas y nada menos que del Hyperloop UPV Team, el cual es un equipo español que trabaja por conseguir y hacer una total realidad el tren supersónico Hyperloop, el cual es un proyecto que ya no tiene marcha atrás.

Este equipo de origen español no ha nacido de la nada, ya que en febrero del año pasado ganaron en la ""Hyperloop Pod Competition"", el cual es un importante concurso organizado por la famosa SpaceX, la compañía responsable del revolucionario transporte. La diferencia es que, desde ese entonces, algo les ha cambiado completamente la vida. ""Tras ganar, tuvimos un impacto que no nos imaginábamos"", cuenta Daniel Orient, quien es uno de los miembros del Hyperloop UPV Team, de la Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (UPV). ""Tanto del sector como de la Comunidad Valenciana como de otros puntos de España, nos apoyan para seguir adelante así que decidimos continuar con nuestro prototipo"", indica el integrante del equipo.
Por esa razón, el equipo ha aumentado su cantidad de integrantes. De hecho para aquel febrero eran tan solo cinco personas. Y en la actualidad ahora son unos 35 jóvenes los que conforman el Hyperloop UPV Team. Todos los integrantes trabajan en sus horas libres en la puesta a punto del que sería el primer prototipo del Hyperloop UPV, el cual ha sido denominado como el tren del futuro, para presentarlo en verano de 2017 en California (Estados Unidos), en la sede principal de SpaceX.

De momento, los planes se están desarrollando excelentemente y sin ningún tipo problemas. ""SpaceX nos va a dar acceso a la pista de pruebas. Es decir, una vez tengamos diseñado y construido el prototipo, pasaremos a probarlo en Los Ángeles"", explica Daniel.
Gracias al gran apoyo y soporte que ha recibido este equipo, será solo cuestión de tiempo cuando podamos ir de Madrid a Francia en tan solo 1 hora, todo esto gracias al que han denominado el tren del futuro, mejor conocido como el Hyperloop."

2432161482,"Apple and Google have been in a heated race to take over the automotive space for some time now, and both companies have had middling success. Today, the battle for the touchscreen on the dashboard of your next new car may have swung dramatically in Google's favor thanks to a new partnership between Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler. In a pre-CES press release, Fiat Chrysler announced that its Uconnect in-vehicle infotainment system will now be integrated with Android.

Most new vehicles that come with some form of a touchscreen interface utilize whatever operating system the manufacturer managed to cobble together. They're often slow, clunky, and not terribly attractive. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto have thus far existed on the fringe, allowing owners of supported vehicles to use the platforms if they want, but as a secondary option behind the default built-in software.

Now, Fiat Chrysler is using Android 7.0 to support its Uconnect software, taking over the job of designing and maintaining its own custom Android skin, and fully integrating Andriod's app support and other features on a core level. A working concept of the Android/Uconnect marriage will be on display at CES 2017.

It's a smart move for Google, who is a seasoned veteran when it comes to handing over the keys to its mobile platform to manufacturers. Apple, on the other hand, keeps things much more locked-down, and it's hard to imagine Cook and company giving anyone - especially an automotive manufacturer - the freedom to tweak iOS in a similar way.

It's interesting to note that many brands under the Fiat Chrysler umbrella are on Apple's list of CarPlay proponents , including Chrysler, Fiat, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Alfa Romeo. It's unclear if any vehicle that would utilize the Android-flavored Uconnect software would also support CarPlay, but that's probably a long shot.

2434140118,"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is letting 1,000 customers try out the latest version of the brand's Autopilot system, another step forward on the way to fully self-driving cars.

The new system being activated on the limited basis is dubbed Autopilot HW2, or Hardware 2, a reference to the Tesla electric vehicles built after October that are loaded with advanced radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors. The limited dissemination of the Autopilot software upgrade is meant to ensure that any glitches are debugged before a broader rollout.

After initiating the Version 8.1 software update over the weekend, Musk tweeted that Tesla would then ""hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.""

The update includes new features to Tesla's Autopilot partial self-driving system, some of which remain in ""beta"" test mode and are explained with cautionary language that in many cases requires drivers to not only stay vigilant but also keep a grip on the steering wheel.

According to a report on Electrek, a site that closely follows the electric vehicle market, the Enhanced Autopilot now has Forward Collision Warning, which allows drivers to set the distance at which they want to alerted with a chime that a collision might be imminent. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control allows the car to speed up or slow based on traffic around it. And there's Low-Speed Autosteer, in which the vehicle uses lane markings to inch along in traffic while staying centered in a lane.

Tesla was in the spotlight throughout 2016 due to a handful of crashes both in the U.S. and abroad that may have been related to either improper use or compromised operation of Autopilot software.

The most publicized incident occurred last May, when Tesla enthusiast and owner Joshua Brown died after his Model S sedan plowed into a truck crossing its path. The Autopilot system didn't see the truck's white side as an object and failed to apply the brakes. Federal regulators are investigating.

Musk has said that Tesla's new HW2 generation vehicles pack so many sophisticated sensors that ultimately they'll be able to provide fully autonomous driving capability by the end of the year. That said, in its 8.1 update, Tesla noted that the rollout ""will be measured and cautious until we have generated confidence across several hundred million miles of real-world usage.""

The coming months are likely to see big strides in autonomous car tech, as companies such as Google, Uber, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Volvo and others look to woo and wow consumers with self-driving features.

The year also promises to be a pivotal one for Musk and his upstart automobile company.

Tesla aims to begin producing its entry-level electric sedan, the $35,000 and up Model 3, next summer. Musk has pinned high hopes on Model 3, specifically a brisk production target that will see Tesla's total vehicle output rocket from 50,000 to 500,000 units a year.

Although Tesla has a market cap of $33 billion, Musk recently decided to make things financially interesting by buying SolarCity, a large solar panel company run by his cousin Lyndon Rive.

Musk had been a majority investor in SolarCity, and his mission now is to turn Tesla's stores into one-stop shopping emporiums for solar panels, electricity storage units (so called Powerwalls and Powerpacks) and electric cars.

To make things even more complex, Musk is busy building out a massive Gigafactory in the desert east of Reno, which will make batteries and, eventually, cars. And that's when he's not at the controls of SpaceX, his rocketry company.

Musk also will sit on a business advisory committee assembled by President-elect Donald Trump that includes Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.
