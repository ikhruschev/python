2430888938,"WASHINGTON - Teams competing in the Google Lunar X Prize, facing an end-of-the-year deadline to obtain a verified launch contract, may not know until some time in January if they will be able to continue in their race to the moon.

The competition, which offers a $20 million grand prize to the first private team to land a spacecraft on the moon, travel at least 500 meters, and transmit video and other data, requires the 16 remaining teams to submit a launch contract to be verified by the X Prize Foundation, which runs the competition, by Dec. 31. Teams that fail to do so will be dropped from contention, while those who continue will have until the end of 2017 to launch their missions.

To date, four teams have verified launch contracts: Moon Express, which will launch on an Electron rocket from Rocket Lab; SpaceIL, which will launch its spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9; Synergy Moon, which will use a Neptune rocket being developed by Interorbital Systems; and TeamIndus, which will launch on a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from the Indian space agency ISRO. A fifth team, Hakuto, announced Dec. 20 it had a verified agreement to fly its rover on the TeamIndus lander.

A German team, PT Scientists, announced Nov. 29 it had a launch contract to fly its lander and rover as a secondary payload, likely on a Falcon 9, through a deal arranged by Spaceflight Industries, the same company that arranged the SpaceIL contract. At the time, the Berlin-based team said its contract was pending verification by the X Prize Foundation.

Team spokesman Sven Przywarra said Dec. 28 that PT Scientists was still awaiting word on the status of their launch contract, and did not expect to hear from the X Prize Foundation until next month. ""X Prize is still verifying our launch contract and will make their decisions public later in January,"" he said. ""We have no further details so far and are awaiting the results.""

In a Sept. 27 talk at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, Andrew Barton, the director of technical operations for the prize, said the Dec. 31 deadline for launch contracts was the deadline for the X Prize Foundation to verify them, not for teams to submit them. It's not known how many launch contracts besides the one PT Scientists submitted are being evaluated. Neither Barton nor X Prize Foundation spokesman Eric Desatnik responded to inquiries Dec. 28 about the status of the competition.

At least two teams are dropping out of the competition. In an op-ed published in SpaceNews Magazine Dec. 19, John Thornton, chief executive of Astrobotic, announced it was leaving the competition. Thornton said the company would continue to develop a lander for a 2019 launch, but said it was unwise for the company to be ""chasing unrealistic prize deadlines"" to remain in the Google Lunar X Prize.

Also leaving the race is Budapest-based Team PuliSpace. Tibor Pacher, team leader and chief executive of Puli Space Tecnologies, said Dec. 29 that his team was retaining an option to fly its rover on Astrobotic's lander and was not planning to find another ride to the moon in order to remain in the competition.

The status of eight other teams remains unknown. Synergy Moon, in a Dec. 24 statement posted on Google Lunar X Prize web site, said it was joining forces with four other teams: Independence-X, Omega Envoy, Team SpaceMeta and Team Stellar. In the statement, Synergy Moon team representative Kevin Myrick said the arrangement was not a merger of the teams but instead a partnership ""such that each team remains a separate entity and retains their current status as an official Google Lunar X Prize team.""

The statement didn't explain the details of the partnership that would allow the teams to remain in the competition as separate entities without launch agreements of some kind. The four teams mentioned in the statement as partnering with Synergy Moon did not respond to requests for comment about their status.

Four other teams that have yet to announce launch contracts or other arrangements - AngelicvM, Euroluna, Plan B and Team Italia - also did not respond to inquiries about their status. One of the four, AngelicvM, had previously planned to fly its rover on Astrobotic's lander.

Pacher said that he was skeptical that any team would be able to claim the prize before it expires at the end of 2017. ""I think there is little chance for whatever team to meet the current deadline,"" he said. ""Signing a contract mere one year before the planned launch date looks anyway extremely risky.""

Barton, speaking at the IAC in September, said there were no plans to further extend the competition, whose deadlines have been stretched out several times. When the Google Lunar X Prize was unveiled in 2007, the competition's grand prize was set to decrease from $20 million to $15 million if no team won it by the end of 2012, and would expire at the end of 2014.

Pacher said he accepted the X Prize Foundation's plans not to extend the deadline again, but added that, should the foundation reconsider that view, it should ""consider a fair reopening of the contest"" for all 16 teams currently in the race.

PT Scientists' Przywarra said his team would likely continue developing their lunar mission regardless of whether their launch contract is verified in time for them to continue in the Google Lunar X Prize. That mission plans to land near the Apollo 17 landing site, with their two rovers approaching the lunar rover left behind by that mission, the last human expedition to the moon to date.

""Our mission to the moon will take place in any way and as it stands today has a good chance of being highly competitive to be the first private mission to the moon,"" he said, ""with the added scientific value of visiting Apollo 17.""

2431636009,"There was a time when NASA was singlehandedly driving America's dream of exploring outer space. But that has changed over the last 15 years. A slew of private space companies have entered the market with ambitious plans to build rockets and colonize new planets. SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin-each led by well-known entrepreneurs-have become household names.

But over the last seven years, hundreds of smaller startups have also popped up, each trying to accomplish something different in the new space race. Astrobotic, for instance, has launched a lunar delivery service, charging $1.2 million per kilo to take anything you want to the moon. World View is developing enormous balloons that can take passengers or equipment to the very outer reaches of our atmosphere. Saber Aeronautics is using video game technology to help people create missions and operate satellites with little training.

Chad Anderson has seen these exciting new developments firsthand as the CEO of the Space Angels Network, an organization that surveys and invests in emerging space startups. It began tracking private space companies in 2009, when SpaceX had its first successful launch, and he says that VC investments in private space companies have been on an upward trajectory every year. (This does not include infusions of corporate capital, such as Google's $1 billion investment in SpaceX last year.) He says that seven years ago, there were fewer than 50 private space companies, but this year, the number has grown to almost 200 that have received non-government funding to execute their business plan.

""There's a robust ecosystem in the space industry now,"" he says. ""In the past, the government would have been a space company's customer. Now they might have the government as a customer for some of their data, but other private customers as well. Then they might buy parts from another space company.""

I sat down with Anderson to discuss some of the big trends that he believes will take off next year.

Governments Play A Bigger Role

While the private space industry is booming, government still has an important role to play in driving space-age technology forward. Space startups often build on primary research that began at NASA, and many also rely on the government to be a customer. ""The exploratory science that NASA is doing translates to private-sector activity eventually,"" Anderson says.

The good news is that Congress appears to be in favor of giving NASA the resources it needs to thrive. It received a $19.3 billion budget in 2016, a nearly $1.3 billion increase from the year before. It is unclear how the Trump Administration will handle NASA. So far, the president-elect has said very little about his plans for the country's space program, and it is unclear whether his pro-business policies will play out in the space sector. ""If it comes at the expense of investing in the longer term gain, his pro-business approach could be harmful,"" Anderson says.

What we do know is that there's growing interest from governments around the world in investing in space. This year, Luxembourg's government invested $227 million in asteroid mining research, which included funds that went to two American companies-Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources-that would create European operations.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency invested $290 million on a probe to orbit Venus, and China's president announced a plan to land ""taikonauts"" on the moon by 2036 and Mars thereafter. Both countries say these space missions are designed to boost the local economy and spur innovation in robotics, aviation, and AI.

Anderson says we can look forward to more private-public partnerships in the future as governments realize the value of investing in space. All of this will be a boon to the space startup community. ""The government has a big role to play as a customer,"" he says. ""It's good to see more agencies, in more countries, interested.""

We'll Figure Out Intergalactic Property Rights

The Outer Space Treaty, which was first signed in 1967, is still the basis of international space law. It was developed right before the U.S. went to the moon and stated, among other things, that no country could place a weapon of mass destruction in orbit in outer space or claim any celestial resource. ""It's a different time in space now from back then,"" Anderson says.

Many within the private space industry are lobbying to modify the treaty to allow companies to claim some portion of what they mine or discover on a space mission. ""What is the incentive to invest private capital and take on so much risk by going to space if you don't even know if you have any claim to resources once you get there?"" Anderson says. ""This creates that incentive.""

He says that one model for a new treaty could be the Homestead Acts of 1866, which the U.S. government created to entice Americans to settle in less inhabited parts of the country, mostly in the West. The law gave applicants ownership of land at little or no cost, which led to more than 270 million acres of public land given to 1.6 million people. By creating similar legislation for the ownership of property in space, many in the private space industry believe more people will be willing to invest in the technological infrastructure to get there.

Space Tourism Will Attract More People

Right now, the idea of space tourism appeals to a small, self-selecting group of people who love the idea of space so much that they are willing to take on the many risks of being among the first private citizens to go to space.

But this is slowly changing. At the National Aerospace Training and Research Center in Pennsylvania, scientists have been trying to understand who can actually withstand the physical stress of flying on a Virgin Galactic rocket, for instance. They're finding that even very old people or people with pins in their bodies after surgery can handle the gravitational pressures and exertion.

As space tourism becomes less pie-in-the-sky fantasy and more concrete reality, and as more people begin to seriously prepare for space flight, the whole concept will seem less daunting. This might even begin happening as early as next year. Again, Anderson compares the voyage to space to the early days of traveling out West. ""At first it took a very special kind of person to leave their families and go off with a shovel and a wheelbarrow,"" he says. ""But once they had developed a train to go out there, a different demographic started traveling. We've seen this scenario play out multiple times over history, and I don't see how this will be any different.""

More Launches

Anderson says that 2017 will be exciting for launches. Blue Origin is planning to start sending trained astronauts next year, and paying commercial passengers the following year. Rocket Lab is set to begin test flights on its Electron small satellite launch vehicle in 2017 as well. There are many other companies depending on these launches to get their satellites and instruments to space. ""Even one new launch system will do a lot to relieve the pressure and backlog we have at the moment,"" Anderson says.

In the past, companies relied on NASA's much bigger launchers to get to space, but companies like Rocket Lab are testing out smaller launch vehicles. While the price of a payload is about the same on either type of vehicle, smaller vehicles tend to be able to launch more frequently and can have smaller customers. ""What they are selling you is the opportunity to be the primary payload,"" Anderson says. ""If the launch is delayed, it is because you were delayed, not because the primary payload you were flying with was delayed. It will take you to the orbit you want to go to, whereas if you ride as the secondary payload you are likely going to another orbit and must figure out how to get to where you wanted to go.""

The moon will continue to be the destination of choice for these spacecraft. While a lot of attention has been paid to NASA and SpaceX's plans to go to Mars, a growing number of companies are working on lunar missions. Astrobotic, for instance, is partnering with a range of organizations-from scientific groups to companies who want to use a lunar landing as part of a marketing campaign-to deliver equipment and materials to the moon. Others are thinking about using the moon as a staging area or a launch site for travel to other parts of our solar system.

All of this extraterrestrial activity is causing concern about the trail of orbital debris that might be left behind. Space law requires companies to clean up after themselves, so expect more of them to invest in creating enormous harpoons that pull trash down from space. There will also be an increase in technologies that help us track where objects are in space.

Next year should bring lots of new developments. But there is an infinite area to explore beyond our planet, so there's a lot left to do. ""Space is a long game,"" says Anderson.

2431710573,"SpaceX is amazing. Not only has Elon Musk's space start-up shaken up the industry by proving that rockets can launch from Earth, and then land back on Earth -- and even on a boat . Not only has it cut the price of such rocket launches enormously -- and forced its rivals at Boeing ( NYSE:BA ) and Lockheed Martin 's ( NYSE:LMT ) United Launch Alliance (ULA) to do the same . And not only has SpaceX published a plan to finally land humans on Mars .

No, SpaceX is also amazing for the fact that it has introduced the concept of customer service to the rocket-launch industry -- and forced its rivals to play catch-up.

How much does it cost to launch a rocket? ULA has the answer. Image source: United Launch Alliance.

Surprise! SpaceX has a menu

Up until recently, SpaceX was unique among major space-launch providers by publishing its launch prices right up front on its website and committing to send ""up to 5.5"" metric tons of payload into geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) for the low, low cost of $62 million.

Shopping for a launch on SpaceX, a customer no longer needed to cold-call a launch company without having any idea what price it might need to pay. At SpaceX, the customer would know what to expect before even placing the call. That removed one small but important (and entirely unnecessary) obstacle to making space accessible to the masses.

What's more, this tiny improvement to the provision of space services is already snowballing. Believe it or not, it's resulted in an improvement in service at ULA, as well.

United Launch Alliance enters the internet age

Thanks, in part, to competition from SpaceX , United Launch Alliance can no longer depend on government largesse to provide all the revenue it needs. Under the administration of new(ish) CEO Tory Bruno, ULA has embarked on a search for more commercial customers . And with its entry into the commercial marketplace, ULA has already learned one valuable lesson: Customer service matters.

To prove it, ULA has taken a page from SpaceX's playbook, announcing last month a new "" RocketBuilder "" website that ""sets a new standard for pricing transparency."" RocketBuilder.com lets a customer input variables for launch date, orbit, rocket configuration, and additional services. This allows the customer ""to build a rocket based on [its] needs,"" and emerge at the end with an all-inclusive launch cost.

Additionally, ULA says its website will provide context for customers, such as savings on insurance costs and the value of ""schedule certainty"" -- the economic value of knowing that a launch won't be delayed, costing the customer millions in lost revenue. (This might happen when a SpaceX rocket blows up on its pad and shuts down operations for the next four months. Speaking hypothetically, of course ).

Service with a smile -- and a dollar sign

How does RocketBuilder work? If you've ever ""built a car"" on Ford.com or GM.com, well, it works a whole lot like that. Start with a basic GTO mission, launching, say, a one-ton satellite aboard an Atlas V rocket sometime in the next three months. That will run you $109 million.

Click a button to transition into geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO), and your price total automatically rises by $6 million. Want a polar orbit instead? Add $2 million more.

Need to launch a bigger payload? No problem. You can triple the size of your satellite without incurring any additional cost. You can even launch 10 tons ... for another $6 million.

And then there's the ""added value."" According to ULA, launching with ULA -- instead of with a company that cannot boast "" 115 missions. 100% success "" on its launches -- saves a customer about $12 million off the cost of insuring a $300 million satellite. Insurers charge $34 million less for a $1 billion satellite launched via ULA than for one launched with ""the other guys.""

ULA will also be happy to explain to you how much money you can save by knowing your satellite will launch when it's supposed to, reach the orbit it's supposed to, and so on. Granted, this facet of the RocketBuilder website seems more like advertising copy than anything else. Still, it gives ULA a chance to argue that its $109 million rock-bottom launch cost only really costs $44 million once you figure in all of the ""extras"" that ULA offers for free.

What it means to investors

Believe it or not, with this new website, ULA has finally outdone SpaceX in the transparency department. Neither SpaceX nor Airbus ' ( NASDAQOTH:EADSY ) Arianespace -- (Airbus is really ULA's main rival in the commercial market) -- offers anything like what ULA has put together with RocketBuilder.

Granted, it shouldn't take SpaceX and Airbus too much work to throw something together if they want to match ULA's ""new standard for pricing transparency."" But for now, ULA has officially become the leader in customer friendliness. It's a big change for the company, but a welcome one.

And if it helps ULA attract more commercial business, generating more revenue and profit for shareholders in its parent companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin -- all the better!

2431958657,@ryanpritchard14 Don't know. The investigation updates are for SpaceX or the FAA to update.
2431990401,"Four months after an explosion tore through its signature Falcon 9 rocket during fueling, destroying the rocket and its multimillion-dollar cargo in just 93 milliseconds, SpaceX says it has isolated what went wrong and is ready to fly again.

If the Federal Aviation Administration issues the company a license, likely following the completion of a full-scale engine test scheduled for Jan. 3, the company will launch 10 communications satellites for Iridium on Jan. 8, including an attempt to land the reusable first stage of the rocket on a sea-going robotic platform.

In a statement, Elon Musk's space company said the problem had to do with special tanks inside the rocket's engine, known as composite over-wrapped pressure vessels, or COPVS. Made of carbon fiber and lined with aluminum, the tanks are designed to hold cold helium under incredibly high pressure. They're fastened inside larger containers of super-cool liquid oxygen that is consumed to propel the rocket.

In a series of tests, SpaceX found ""buckles""-spaces between the aluminum liner and the carbon-fiber wrapping of the COPVs-where the liquid oxygen could pool; at the super-low temperatures SpaceX is working in, the oxygen could even become a solid. As the pressure in the tank increases, oxygen trapped in those buckles could be ignited if the carbon fibers crack or rub together to generate friction, an even higher risk when the oxygen becomes a solid.

For upcoming launches, the company's engineers will re-configure the helium COPVs to keep them warmer, and also load propellant according to a method the company has previously used without incident more than 700 times. But, over the long term, SpaceX acknowledged that it will need to re-design its tanks to keep these ""buckles"" from occurring at all.

This could pose a problem for the company's goal of making its rockets largely reusable to drive down the costs of space access. In 2016, SpaceX began a new pre-flight fueling process that allowed it to use even colder liquid oxygen in its rockets; because the cold liquid oxygen is so dense, more can be stored into in a tank of the same volume, allowing the rocket to fly further, including returning to earth after a mission.

The innovative fueling process was considered important to creating full reusability of the rocket, with Musk telling MIT students in 2014 that ""when the propellants are cooled close to their freezing temperature to increase the density, we could definitely do full reusability.""

COPV technology has long been seen as useful for rocket construction, but engineers at NASA and other companies have encountered problems when the organic material in the carbon interacts and even combusts with the liquid oxygen frequently used as a propellant. SpaceX appeared to have solved these problems and takes great pride in its carbon-wrapping technology; Musk's company is currently testing an enormous COPV intended for use in the company's mooted inter-planetary vehicle.

A successful launch in the days ahead would be a boon for SpaceX, which has a crowded manifest of commercial launches to attend to after missing the last quarter of 2016. The company also promises to debut its new Falcon Heavy rocket this year and is planning for a fall test flight of its Dragon 2 spacecraft, which the company hopes to be the first private vessel to carry astronauts in 2018.

SpaceX watchers had been expecting the company to return to flight soon; it had originally anticipated a mid-December launch date. Over the weekend, there was another preview when Iridium reported that its satellites had been loaded into the shell that will protect them when the rocket takes off:

"
2431996949,"SpaceX has concluded its investigation into the cause of an accident on a Cape Canaveral launchpad during which one of its rockets exploded, the company reported Monday . The investigation, conducted in partnership with federal safety and space agencies including the FAA and NASA, involved closely reviewing all recorded materials and data, as well as running tests at SpaceX's facilities in Hawthorne, CA and McGregor, TX.

The results of the investigation point to the issue that caused a Falcon 9 rocket to explode in September during pre-launch fueling. SpaceX's investigation team found that there was a failure of a pressure vessel found inside a tank used to store liquid oxygen for the rocket's second stage fuel burn. The problem in this case was that oxygen built up between the liner and overwrap of the vessel, which was probably made worse by loading helium so cold it turned the pooled oxygen from liquid to solid. SpaceX says it will enact both short- and long-term fixes to address these problems and is confident they will ensure a safe fueling process both immediately and in the future.

Now that the investigation is concluded, SpaceX hopes to get back to flying on January 8, the target date for its launch with client Iridium satellites. SpaceX will use a Falcon 9 to deliver a payload of 10 Iridium satellites to orbit, which the telecommunications network is using to create a voice and data network. The satellites from Iridium are already loaded into the Falcon 9's transport capsule .

If SpaceX does indeed meet their launch window and successfully return to active mission status, their turnaround time between the September accident and getting back to launches will be unprecedented, and would go a long way toward returning full confidence to the other clients on its launch manifest.

"
2432006728,"Four months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a Florida launch pad, SpaceX has determined that the cause was a failed composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store liquid helium.

In the final update to its investigation released Monday, the Hawthorne space company said one of three such tanks in the rocket's larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank failed, probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel's aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited. In November, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk described the cause of the explosion as something that has ""never been encountered before in the history of rocketry.""

The company said its accident investigation team - made up of officials from SpaceX, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts - found ""buckles,"" or valleys, in the vessels' inner liners.

Super-chilled liquid oxygen can gather in buckles, and when pressurized, the oxygen can get trapped. Then, ""breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap,"" causing the vessel to fail, SpaceX said.

The company also said the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, ""which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.""

To fix this issue in the short term, SpaceX said it will change the configuration of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels ""to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded."" It will also change helium loading operations to a ""prior flight proven configuration"" that is based on procedures that were used in hundreds of successful loads.

SpaceX plans to eventually change the design of the vessels to prevent buckles, which the company said will allow for faster loading operations.

The company is now targeting Jan. 8 for its return to flight, pending FAA approval. SpaceX plans to launch 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc. from Vandenberg Air Force Base."
2432011119,"After the explosion in September of one of its rockets, SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space, the company announced on Monday, with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday.

In a statement, SpaceX - or more formally, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation - said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum.

The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence.

The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations - the fueling of propellants - about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.)

The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the two-stage rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa.

Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites.

With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor's building nearby.

""The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,"" SpaceX said in its statement.

The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the second-stage liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank.

In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used for rocket propulsion. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust.

But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid.

""Really surprising problem that's never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,"" Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November.

Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said.

Tests at SpaceX's facilities in Hawthorne, Calif., and McGregor, Tex., supported that conclusion, the company said.

The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said.

The next SpaceX launch is to carry a 10-pack of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car.

A month ago, Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in mid-December, but less than a week later, SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January.

The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

For launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month."
2432014428,"SpaceX plans to resume Falcon 9 launches on Jan. 8 after completing the investigation into the pad explosion that destroyed another Falcon 9 four months ago.

In a statement posted on the SpaceX website Jan. 2, the company said the explosion was caused by the failure of one of three helium tanks, known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), inside the liquid oxygen tank in the rocket's second stage. The company had previously indicated that a COPV failure was a leading cause of the accident.

Each COPV is made of an aluminum liner surrounded by a carbon composite overwrap. Other COPVs recovered from the Falcon 9 showed buckling of their liners, although what caused the buckling isn't stated.

SpaceX said that the buckling, in and of itself, did not cause the tanks to fail. Instead, the company believes the buckles created voids between the liner and composite overwrap where liquid oxygen could pool. ""When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail,"" the company said. The temperature of the helium in the COPV is also cold enough to freeze some of the oxygen, exacerbating the problem.

In its statement, SpaceX said that investigators did not find a single, most likely cause of the failure, but all the potential causes were similar. ""The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled [liquid oxygen] or [solid oxygen] in buckles under the overwrap,"" the company stated.

SpaceX's return-to-flight plans call for changes in procedures for fueling the rocket rather than design changes to the COPVs. According to the company, it will use warmer helium in the COPVs and also change the process for loading helium into those tanks ""to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.""

The company didn't state what effect these changes would have on launch preparations or vehicle performance. The current version of the Falcon 9 uses so-called ""super-cooled"" propellants, where liquid oxygen is chilled to near the freezing point to increase its density and improve the vehicle's performance. Those propellants are loaded into the Falcon 9 shortly before launch.

Those procedural changes are intended only to be short-term solutions. ""In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations,"" the company stated, but did not give a schedule for making those design changes.

The short-term fixes, though, should allow the Falcon 9 to resume launches that were put on hold after the Sept. 1 pad explosion. That includes the first of seven launches of Iridium Next satellites, which is now scheduled for no earlier than Jan. 8 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

""Iridium is pleased with SpaceX's announcement on the results of the Sept. 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight on Jan. 8 with the first Iridium Next launch,"" Iridium said in a Jan. 2 statement.

That schedule is pending the issuance of a launch license from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA has not granted that license yet, but sources say the FAA has received and is reviewing SpaceX's report on the pad accident. In its statement, SpaceX noted that the FAA ""provided oversight and coordination for the investigation"" as part of the investigation team.

Should SpaceX successfully return to flight with the Iridium mission, its next launch is expected to be of the EchoStar-23 communications satellite later in January. That launch will be the first SpaceX mission from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a former space shuttle pad that SpaceX is leasing primarily for Falcon 9 launches of its Crew Dragon spacecraft and launches of its Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX will be using the pad for other Falcon 9 launches because of damage sustained at Space Launch Complex 40 in the September pad explosion."
2432017830,"SpaceX is targeting a Sunday return to flight of its Falcon 9 rocket from California, where the company will adjust fueling procedures believed responsible for a Sept. 1 explosion that destroyed a rocket and satellite on their Cape Canaveral launch pad.

A four-month investigation pinpointed failures in the system that uses cold helium gas to pressurize propellant tanks filled with super-chilled liquid oxygen, SpaceX said.

Investigators found buckles had formed in the aluminum lining of helium tanks that are about as large as a person.

When the system was pressurized, the buckles trapped pools of liquid or solid oxygen between the linings and an outer layer of carbon wrap covering them. That build-up of oxygen probably created friction or caused carbon fibers to break, SpaceX said, which ignited the oxygen in the rocket's upper stage during a countdown rehearsal at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 40.

The Falcon 9 and Spacecom's $200 million Amos-6 commercial communications satellite, which Facebook had hoped to use to extend Internet access in Africa, were lost, and the launch pad was severely damaged.

In an update posted online Monday morning, SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, said the helium tanks will be redesigned, but did not specify when that longer-term change would be implemented.

To prevent buckling in the short-term, the company said it would revert to ""a prior flight proven configuration"" for loading helium, including loading the gas at a warmer temperature. Those procedures have worked safely more than 700 times, SpaceX said, but take more time.

The planned Sunday launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base will carry the first 10 of at least 70 communications satellites that SpaceX is contracted to launch for Iridium Communications.

As it did through much of the first half of last year, SpaceX plans to try to land the Falcon 9's first stage on a modified barge in the ocean, continuing efforts to recover and re-launch Falcon boosters.

Before Sunday, SpaceX plans to fuel the Falcon 9 for a practice countdown like the one performed Sept. 1, intended to end with a brief firing of the rocket's nine Merlin main engines. This time, no payload will be on top.

If the return to flight succeeds, a Falcon 9 could try to launch an unmanned Dragon cargo ship to the International Space Station from Kennedy Space Center before the end of the month.

The Sept. 1 explosion was the second time in 14 months that a Falcon 9 suffered a catastrophic failure. In June 2015, another breach in the upper-stage liquid oxygen tank doomed a Dragon mission to the International Space Station about two minutes into flight. SpaceX said that problem, attributed to a failed strut, was unrelated to the Sept. 1 explosion.

SpaceX led the recent investigation with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches. Other partners included NASA, the Air Force, the National Transportation Safety Board and several unidentified ""industry experts.""

""SpaceX greatly appreciates the support of our customers and partners throughout this process, and we look forward to fulfilling our manifest in 2017 and beyond,"" the company said in a statement.

Drawing from more than 3,000 channels of data from video and telemetry, the investigation focused on an instant - less than a tenth of a second - from the first sign of trouble to the rocket's destruction.

For weeks after the accident, Musk did not rule out the possibility that someone might have fired a shot at the rocket.

NASA has been performing its own, independent investigation and has not yet released any findings.

The space agency relies upon SpaceX to deliver cargo to and from the space station, and also hopes to see the company launch astronauts to the outpost in early 2018.

SpaceX's late fueling of the Falcon 9 during the final half-hour of countdowns, when a crew would be sitting atop the rocket, has been a source of concern to NASA and some of its independent safety advisers."
2432018328,"Over the last several years, we've seen a rise in private companies valued at over a billion dollars - the so-called ""unicorns.""

But when too many startups became unicorns, a new class of startups emerged: "" decacorns ,"" or companies valued at over $10 billion.

These are the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world, the startups that steadfastly remain private companies as they seek more millions in funding at higher and higher valuations.

Below are the US startups valued at more than $10 billion.

8. Dropbox

Valuation: $10 billion

CEO Drew Houston

Dropbox reached its $10 billion valuation in 2014 after a $617 million funding round. Since then, the company has shifted its focus to business customers, launching Dropbox Enterprise last year.

The company began to cut back on lavish spending an employee perks in 2016, something that was costing the company $25,000 per year per employee. While Dropbox doesn't disclose its financials, it's reported to have generated more than $500 million in revenue last year. CEO Drew Houston said in June that the company is free cash flow positive now , which is a milestone for a fast-growth tech company.

Various reports have pegged a Dropbox IPO as taking place sometime in 2017, but as of August , no final decisions had been made.

7. Pinterest

Valuation: $10.47 billion

CEO Ben Silbermann

In May 2015, Pinterest raised a $533 million Series G from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, First Mark, and Goldman Sachs, bumping the New York-based company's valuation up to $10.47 billion.

The virtual discovery and pinning platform has more than 100 million monthly active users, over half of whom are international. The company has expanded its focus in recent months to overseas markets like the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil, and has doubled down on growing advertising on its platform. In August, Pinterest acquired online bookmarking service Instapaper .

Rumors have been swirling throughout 2016 that Pinterest is on the brink of going public, and in October, the company named its first chief financial officer , a signal that Pinterest could be inching closer to an IPO.

6. SpaceX

Valuation: $12 billion

CEO Elon Musk

After raising a $1 billion funding round from Fidelity and Google in January 2015, Elon Musk's SpaceX reached a $12 billion valuation.

Less than a year later, SpaceX made history when it launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space, dropped off a satellite, then landed back on the ground safely. The success of the launch and landing proved it was possible to reuse expensive rockets , rather than letting them fall into the ocean.

But 2016 has been a more challenging year for the company. In September, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a launch-pad test, destroying a satellite Facebook intended to lease. SpaceX has since delayed the debut of another, more powerful rocket system - the Falcon Heavy - and delayed launches crewed by NASA astronauts until 2018.

5. WeWork

Valuation: $16.9 billion

WeWork cofounders Miguel McKelvey and Adam Neumann

Coworking startup WeWork closed on $690 million in funding in October, putting its valuation over $16 billion and making it the fifth-most-valuable startup in the US. 

But in July, reports surfaced that the company was cutting its revenue forecasts by 14% and telling employees to change how they spend money. 

The startup has also run into labor board issues: WeWork is facing a formal complaint from the National Labor Relations Board, which has asked an administrative law judge to order WeWork to change policies that ban employees from filing class-action lawsuits. 


4. Snap

Valuation: $18.19 billion*

CEO Evan Spiegel

In November, Snap Inc. - formerly Snapchat - quietly filed for an initial public offering that could value that company at $25 billion (some sources peg it closer to $40 billion). The company aims to raise ""as much as $4 billion"" when it goes public early next year, according to recent reports.

The company made a big shift in 2016 when it launched its camera-equipped glasses, Spectacles. The move shifted Snap away from being just a mobile app and into the hardware world. Snap now calls itself ""a camera company.""

But Snap's app Snapchat remains one of the most popular consumer internet services, challenging Facebook, Twitter, and Google for users and advertising dollars; the startup has said it expects to make anywhere between $250 million to $350 million in advertising revenue this year.

*Snap is working on an initial public offering for March 2017

3. Palantir

Valuation: $20.53 billion

CEO Alex Karp

Palantir has raised nearly $2 billion in investment, reaching a $20 billion valuation last year. But despite a reported $1.7 billion in ""bookings"" in 2015 (revenue under contract), Palantir may not be profitable yet. 

The data-mining startup is notoriously secretive, and in June, reports surfaced that Palantir was buying back $225 million in stock from employees in exchange for their silence. 

Palantir is backed by the CIA's venture-capital arm and is said to have worked with the government, at one point being implicated as a player in Edward Snowden's revelations about government spying. It was also said to help the US find Osama bin Laden, and help police sift through massive amounts of video, using facial recognition, to find the Boston Marathon bombers.

2. Airbnb

Valuation: $30 billion

Product chief Joe Gebbia, CTO Nathan Blecharczyk, CEO Brian Chesky

Home-rental startup Airbnb had a challenging 2016, but the company is still the second most-valuable startup in the US. 

In August, Airbnb filed to raise a massive, $850 million round of funding that would value the company at $30 billion. But shortly thereafter, the startup became embroiled in legal battles in two of its most crucial cities, San Francisco and New York. 

In October, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill that bans the advertising of rentals for less than 30 days if the tenant isn't present. In November, the company faced a legal setback in San Francisco when a judge ruled that the city's law mandating hosts register does not run afoul of free speech rights.

But the company hasn't slowed down, launching a new service called Trips in November with the intent of becoming a more full-service travel company. 

1. Uber

Valuation: $68 billion

CEO Travis Kalanick

Uber is the most valuable startup in the US and across the globe, outpacing its closest global rival, Xiaomi, by more than $20 billion. 

The ride-hailing startup raised several billion dollars in 2016, including $3.5 billion from a Saudi Arabian investment fund and $2 billion in the form of a leveraged loan. 

But the startup also closed a major deal with its chief rival, China's Didi Chuxing, with Didi making a $1 billion investment in Uber global and acquiring Uber's Chinese arm in a $35 billion mega-merger.

Now, Uber is focused on expanding its self-driving car testing and tackling ride-hailing rivals in Southeast Asia."
2432022202,"The tech industry has talked long and hard about democratizing industries. Democratizing content, democratizing taxi-cabs, and democratizing bed and breakfasts. But what about democratizing democracy?

Disruption is the word of the moment in Washington, thanks to an incoming president who counts his inexperience in government as an asset. It remains to be seen what kind of disruption Trump will bestow upon the White House, but efforts at disruption from the technology world have refined and chipped at only the topmost layer of inefficiencies. Mark Zuckerberg has poured cash into a broken school district; programmers have toyed with ways to secure digital ballots ; and analysts have sought (and failed) to hone the political poll. The team of engineers Barack Obama lured to Washington has been tasked with fixing podunk websites and backend systems. But what they have failed to identify as a problem is the very system that elected their boss. Because beyond the topmost layer of government gunk lies a broad and broken structure: the idea of representation itself. In the era of the internet, the very premise of sending a man to Washington or a woman to city council is badly in need of an upgrade.

The idea of a political representative evolved out of necessity. Townspeople couldn't afford to take a day off and ride a horse to the capital. They needed to agree upon one guy who would more or less say what they were thinking, and they voted to pick the right guy for the job.

Horses became model T's became jets flying politicians from their constituencies to the District of Columbia, ostensibly to have an ear to the ground in their home state and a hand to the buzzers on the Senate floor. But travel-and voter awareness-requires cash that drives up the price of running for office.

The Republican President-elect scored votes by calling Washington ""corrupt"" and ""criminal,"" ""rigged"" and ""stagnant,"" but ""quaint"" is the first adjective I think of. In the era of the iPhone, sending a man or woman to Washington to ""represent"" a district back home can feel about as forward-thinking as sending an intern to Amazon headquarters to pick up the new DeLillo. Why do congressional offices read bills in hard-copy, in private, while their constituents draft their work in Google Docs? Why does a senator have to stand on the Senate floor to hear arguments or to vote, when her constituents watch proceedings on C-Span and vote for which Game of Thrones heroine her hair most resembles on BuzzFeed?

So why do we still send politicians to Washington to read bills and press buzzers? For the in-person schmoozing politicians call ""compromise,"" but which their constituents see as ripe ground for a sherry-drinking, old-boy oligarchy? (For the ""swamp"" Trump vows to his voters that he will ""drain""? ) Nowadays, American voters appear to be unhappy with the very premise that would require a politician to be a living, breathing human being.

What if your city council member was an empty vessel whose every decision you voted for on your smartphone?

Hear me out for a minute. Secretary of State offices across the country hold data on their voters by region. That data allows politicians to gerrymander or election commissioners to establish polling locations. That data is also publicly available. At your local library, you can use LexisNexis to look up your next-door neighbor's party affiliation and their contributions to candidates. (And also, much to the amusement of snoopy government reporters, the price of their house, the last few apartments they lived in, their registered businesses, and their criminal and bankruptcy records.) But among the people who currently make use of that public data for gain are pollsters and political operatives. Their mission is not to make government the most cost-efficient or most effective for communities; it's to figure out how to put a wealthy man on a horse and send him to Washington.

Why not use that public data to define a set of local voters in a single district--a district defined by geography and population numbers, not by political gerrymandering. Send out an app for download to those voters--call it something like ""LocalGovernment"" but sexier--and supply those voters with a login and two-step authentication? So rather than electing a representative to vote in their district's interest bill by bill, those district members, using that secure token, and perhaps a system like the blockchain, could each cast votes on issues in their district.

Which is to say that rather than voting on a human to represent us from afar, we could vote directly, issue-by-issue, on our smartphones, cutting out the cash pouring into political races, and embodying the highest ideals inscribed in our founding documents regarding the ""will of the People.""

Eliminating the waste and the influence of celebrity and personality in order to bring consumers exactly what they want is part of what Silicon Valley has already defined as its progressive, political mission. Where we once called cab companies at phone numbers advertised on yellow pages and business cards, we now conjure by app the cheapest, nearest driver. Where once we plucked CDs from Borders' bins based on a cover image of Shania Twain-analytics now drive our Spotify playlists. The list goes on.

Personality and celebrity play an inarguably smaller role in Swiss politics than they do in the US. This is due in part to the country's use of system called a ""direct democracy""--a version of which took place in ancient Athens. Swiss voters can put forward ballot measures which can gain traction and be voted on directly. Voters receive information on issues and ballot papers through the post office, and can send votes back in sealed envelopes. Passing wider measures at higher levels requires a higher proportion of the electorate--a natural check on trending activism.

The price of running for office is now astronomical, literally; a New Hampshire senate race tops the cost of sending your satellite to low earth orbit with SpaceX's rocket

America's founding fathers considered this method of government and decided to reject it. James Madison warned that a direct democracy would result in what he called a ""tyranny of the majority""; he worried voting on issues by direct majority rule would allow that majority of the electorate to oppress the minority. The world saw this first hand when California voted on Proposition 8 in 2008. And they saw it in 2009, when Switzerland's direct democracy moved to outlaw minarets as a response to Islamophobia.

But both problems have been righting themselves through the now all-powerful courts: a Muslim community in Switzerland is planning to take its fight over a Minaret to the federal court, where the fight for same-sex marriage found its finish line in the US. And any Clinton supporters who now praise the inherent fairness of electing a president based on the popular vote rather than the electoral college would be hypocritical to back any system premised on a fear of the ""tyranny of the majority.""

Meanwhile, the ""republic"" system our founding fathers selected has proved itself broken. In 2016, parties can gain power in our Republic by re-mapping districts not to help constituencies, but to hold seats. The strategy of suppressing votes is so mainstream it has become banal. And the price of running for office is now astronomical, literally; a New Hampshire senate race ($120 million) tops the cost of sending your satellite to low earth orbit with SpaceX's rocket ($62 - $90 million).

But the most disturbing fact of our Republic is an upsurge of anti-intellectual rhetoric . An ongoing protest of California's default direct democracy-its barrage of referendums- is fueled by the disturbing fact that voters are likely to base their decision on a television advertisement. Referendum protesters rightly note that a system reliant on advertising hardly cuts money out of politics or ensures an informed electorate. But the premise of this protest rests on the assumption that a Representative is more informed than a television advertisement; that a Representative makes decisions by speaking with experts, using paid time and expertise. I should note here that the President-Elect has appointed a man who believes ancient Egyptians used the pyramids as grain silos to head America's housing department.

Thomas Jefferson once wrote that if he were ever to decide between a ""government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."" But we now appear headed toward a country where there isn't much faith in either. And both parties would agree that the Fourth Estate has lost its check on power. Democrats blame consumers who down only sound-bites; readers who fail to seek facts; a business model that has forced papers to abandon investigation; and politicians who vaunt the power to block access. Republicans see the press as financially-inclined to protect the status quo and morally-inclined to predict outcomes from glass towers rather than to mix with the good people of Kansas.

Critics put forward solutions: a Chrome extension that tags fake news; rewriting old-school newspaper rules on bias and false equivalency; and the wholesale relocation of sneering pundits to Midwestern towns, trying to make sense of them. All of these provocative, progressive ideas would add a nice polish to any turd. But the real disease remains lodged in the throat of the system.

Because what the media loves to consume and what it has no power to destroy is the power of a personality. Film scholars have written long on the power of a face to keep viewers' rapt. Cable news doesn't fill airwaves with talking heads to keep viewers frustrated; producers book talking heads because people like to watch heads, talking. And if TV reporters seem allergic to the reporting of studies, journal articles, and data investigations, that's because to grab viewers a story requires a human face. TV news and papers have been blamed for failing to report t hat the emperor wears no clothes. But blasting such a headline on screen or above the fold tends to make any naked man an emperor.

Technologists will likely continue to work on developing new ways to stop ""fake news"" and clickbait media, but if they really want to improve the functioning of democracy , they could apply their skills to a bigger challenge. By stripping away the human personality engrained in our politics-and migrating from a republic to a direct democracy-we might circumvent the media's appetite for a face altogether, and the public thirst for personality in its politicians.

Online direct democracy isn't a new idea. In Australia, a direct democracy app called Flux is also a political party, which this summer put up 13 candidates for election to Australia's Senate in federal elections. Built by Bitcoin enthusiasts using the blockchain platform, the app aims to let Australians who can prove they are registered voters tell proxy senators how to vote on laws. Flux also allows for vote trading, allowing voters to have bigger say in issues they really care about, and let others vote on issues they're more passionate about.

In Argentina, meanwhile, a band of engineers has been developing a set of tools to engage directly with an electorate. Political scientist Pia Mancini said that she created DemocracyOS to shrink the distance between elected officials and their constituents. She was dissatisfied with the personality and cash in politics, and with the way elected officials were only inclined to engage their constituents ahead of a vote. Her group's platform allows governments to reach out and interact with voters--and vice versa--and has been used by activists in Tunisia and the Mexican government to gather feedback on policy proposals. Her new project, co-founded with fellow Argentine Santiago Siri, is Democracy Earth, a Y Combinator-funded non-profit that designs software to enable decentralized governance in any organization.

A similar model is already in use in over 1,000 governments and organizations around the world: participatory budgeting is a process that allows people to submit ideas for what government should spend a portion of its money on and then vote on the best ideas, giving people direct control over a portion of a budget. Recently, Portugal became the first county to implement a nationwide participatory budgeting process , starting with a modest €3 million for its first year.

Hacktivists are toying with implementing a so-called ""liquid democracy;"" a platform that would allow voters across the US to go about creating a kind of third party. Its representatives would be required to follow the orders of constituents who deliberated and came to a consensus around issues online. But political parties harden, and close out voters who don't already see their ideas gaining sway; the very minority whose ideas are already shut out of the process.

I propose an idea that would force representatives to respond to their engaged electorate vote-by-vote, but would never harden along a party line. The system could grow to include the US president. But it should start where it can start tomorrow: at the lowest-level of political representation, the local government.

Let's start at the beginning, with arguably the most complex head-scratcher: how could a smartphone app draft a new and relevant bill for the people of a certain district to put forward?

Every political office in the nation already employs a staff paid by taxpayers who typically write those bills. Today, they are hired and fired at the will of an elected official who steers their work to what he or she judges to be a priority. At-will political staffers are not hired transparently-a source of consternation for government watchdogs who monitor their rising salaries, connections to landed interests, and the patterns of their political donations.

The viral model voters use to criticize an existing system and argue for its destruction (see r/The_Donald ) might also be used to create fixes.

With the ""LocalGovernment"" app, this staff's hiring becomes more transparent. Headhunting firms could reply to a public request to ""bid"" for the challenge of interviewing candidates. The people of the district could vote on their smartphones to hire both the headhunter and the candidates. The staff could serve under the same guidelines that work to prevent civil service boards from becoming overtly political: they could be appointed to rotating terms, with a termination set by a vote of the people. Personality and political donations would be cut from the process. Candidates would be more accurately hired on merit.

These staff members would be the ones to draft legislation. And what they are tasked to draft would not be chosen by the horse-riding politician, but rather through the people's will directly. Here's how: A resident could bring a problem in his or her community to a neighborhood's attention by starting a Change.org-type petition on the app. Those who click ""Agree"" could upvote the petition in a Reddit-like user-driven forum. And once a certain number of people click ""agree,"" the petition could go out as a text alert to other voters within a certain distance of the original poster. With 1,000 more ""agrees,"" it could go to a wider field, and so on.

Once a petition snowballs to a certain number, the issue could, as in the Swiss system, go before administrators who could reach out to the initial petitioner to draft legislation. Finally, the legislation would be ""voted"" as ready by a majority of the electorate. In short, the viral model voters use to criticize an existing system and argue for its destruction (see r/The_Donald ) might also be used to create fixes.

Think of it from the perspective of a government administrator who serves your neighborhood or district. Rather than take orders from a human boss with pesky, human failings beholden to the interests of big donors, the administrator would instead take their orders from a computer screen that has been vetted by constituents. Which boss would you prefer?

Fixing an existing problem with new technology often fuels new and terrifying questions. Displacing power simply raises the same questions of control and ownership in new places. For example, even without the risk of politicians becoming susceptible to lobbyists, voters could still be influenced by special interest groups that can afford to bombard voters with their message. But by distributing the power for change among the electorate, a direct democracy model would effectively make lobbying efforts much more expensive and inefficient.

And displacing power raises questions of how informed our progress can be. We want our representatives to know the law and speak with experts, using paid time that their citizens lack. Voters might be more informed than a personality politician who runs on an anti-intellectual campaign. But can they be as informed as, say, Amy Klobuchar or John Lewis?

The architecture of our app could try to correct the problem. Unlike a ballot box in a high school gymnasium, our app could require our electorate to engage with an issue. For instance, before casting a vote, voters could be required to spend a certain amount of screen time reviewing prospective legislation-just as a company requires employees to view a silly H.R. video. Or we could also decide as a community to hire an outside monitoring group such as the Better Government Association to review the legislation and report to our voters its potential effects. (Frankly, why this isn't already done on a regular basis is a question that consternates every local government reporter.)

And those who develop any app that allows us to govern directly would have to take into consideration how it might function to counter personality politics and combat misinformation. The app's security should work to prevent the Putin-paid trolls who have reportedly skewed America's political discussions by restricting conversations that cover a district to the residents of that district. Its platform should be developed in a way that relies only minimally on imagery, penalizes click-bait, and allows for the flagging and quick removal of hateful material. And like Wikipedia, it should encourage a reliance on sources and facts. None of this will be easy of course, but Silicon Valley says it's now thinking seriously about solutions.

And then there's the question of who could afford to develop and distribute this system, to control and protect it, and to allow for its ongoing modification in the service of the people. For this I look where our founding fathers looked: to the will of the people. If the app can allow the people to govern themselves, can the people not also govern the app: setting up a foundation, collectively deciding on hires, and in short, founding a co-operative?

These are questions I am not prepared to answer. But I have two ideas about how we can get started thinking about them in earnest. First: a politician could put forward a referendum along these lines: ""Approving a new property tax for the public funding of an administrative office, and the distribution of 1.6 million smartphones to the people of Smallville in order to put forward legislation directly and to allow the people to vote, directly, issue-by-issue."" (Because of course the first problem is how to get a phone and a free phone plan into every hand.) Or a candidate could run on a platform of direct democracy. ""If I win,"" he or she could pledge, ""I will set up a system for you to rule yourselves.""

They might invoke the line that the founding fathers used in the Declaration of Independence? ""We hold these truths to be self-evident... That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""

What I do know: our system is broken. Voters crave transparency, an end to political photo-ops, an end to the influence of television, of Facebook, a way to flush the lobbyists out of Washington and drag the cash out of politicians' pockets. As a citizenry, we hold relatively little power to destroy lobbying; to reform pay-to-play; to transform the media industries; re-engineer Facebook, or temper the bad behavior of the wealthy and powerful. But our new technologies also mean that there's one central component we might have the power to remove from government completely: the politicians.

"
2432023965,"Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is preparing to resume rocket launches on Jan. 8, according to industry officials, using revised operational procedures developed in response to a fiery accident that occurred during routine ground preparations last fall.

The tentative blastoff date for the Falcon 9 from North California's Vandenberg Air Force Base is subject to results of testing later this week, these officials said, and still could change.

But if everything checks out, they said, Iridium Communications Inc., which has been eagerly waiting to get the first 10 of its next-generation communications satellites into orbit since the September 2016 fireball, anticipates a launch next Sunday morning.

SpaceX, as the closely held Southern California company is called, previously said the explosion on the launchpad, which destroyed the rocket and a single commercial satellite, was the result of problematic fueling procedures rather than a design or manufacturing flaw.

About eight minutes before a scheduled test firing, according to the company, a pressurized helium bottle inside the rocket's second stage ruptured, leading to a nearly instantaneous explosion.

Investigators have determined that a complex interplay of variables during fueling, including temperature and pressure, caused a breach in the helium vessel that resulted in ignition.

In its latest statement, SpaceX said the extensive investigation concluded the accident ""was likely due to accumulation of oxygen"" between the vessel's aluminum liner and what is called the composite overwrap. The company said testing revealed that supercooled fuel can pool in ""a void or buckle in the liner,"" subsequently breaking carbon fibers or creating an ignition source.

But the statement also highlighted the complex, somewhat tentative nature of the detailed conclusions. SpaceX noted that in the end, investigators ""identified several credible causes"" for the failure of the helium container, and that ""corrective actions address all credible causes.""

For the short term, the company plans to load helium into the rocket at a slower pace than previously, and it said the temperature of the helium will be higher than it was the day of the 2016 accident. In the long term, however, SpaceX said it intends to implement design changes to prevent such buckling altogether, ""which will allow for faster [fuel] loading operations.""

Mr. Musk, SpaceX's founder, chairman and chief executive, previously said the explosion prompted the most challenging investigation in the company's 14-year history. He also has said that fueling practices involving supercooled fuel can result in the formation of solid oxygen, which can interact with layers of carbon-fiber wrapped around helium vessels and lead to ignition.

Monday's statement confirmed that the helium being loaded last September was ""cold enough to create solid oxygen, which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen being trapped"" between layers of the helium vessel, creating an ignition source. SpaceX also said part of the operational changes entail returning to ""flight proven"" fueling procedures that have been used successfully hundreds of times over the years.

SpaceX has been heading up the accident probe, with cooperation from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force and other government and industry experts. The company is responsible for determining the cause of the explosion, while the FAA has authority to accept the final report and issue a launch license

The Falcon 9's return to flight has slipped from mid-November to mid-December to early January, as investigators wrapped up their probe and continued to assess a number of specific variables that may have caused the explosion.

The impending mission carries huge stakes for both SpaceX and Iridium. Mr. Musk's company, which has a roughly a $10 billion backlog of launch contracts, seeks to show commercial and U.S. government customers it can bounce back and speed up its launch tempo.

SpaceX suffered an earlier rocket explosion, 14 months prior to the 2016 accident, when a Falcon 9 broke apart shortly after launch carrying cargo destined for the international space station. The company determined the 2015 accident was caused by the rupture of a substandard metal piece supporting a pressurized helium vessel.

The initial accident prompted SpaceX to revise its quality-control procedures, step up testing of subcontractor parts and reassess some broader safety practices.

Satellite-services provider Iridium seeks to allay investor concerns about the fate of its multibillion-dollar constellation of replacement spacecraft. Last month Iridium released a statement indicating ""we remain as confident as ever"" in SpaceX's ""ability to safely deliver our satellites into low-Earth orbit.""

Iridium, which supplies voice and data services world-wide, is relying on an aging satellite fleet operating without adequate in-orbit spares. By early 2018, the company expects six additional Falcon 9 launches carrying 60 more of its satellites.

Airlines and air-traffic control organizations also are closely monitoring the launch schedule because Iridium's new satellite fleet includes navigation and tracking technology designed to help track aircraft in regions lacking ground-based radar coverage."

2432026055,"Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is slated to launch several Iridium communications satellites Jan. 8 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's central coast, marking the company's first return to flight since a Sept. 1 fireball destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on a Florida launch pad.

An accident investigation team ""concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels inside the second stage liquid oxygen tank failed,"" SpaceX said Monday in a statement on its website . The September failure was likely because of an oxygen buildup or a void in the buckle in the liner of the vessel, the company said.

The announcement of a launch date means that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has accepted SpaceX's investigation report regarding the Sept. 1 mishap, which founder Elon Musk has called the company's most perplexing failure in 14 years. The blast occurred during a test firing of the rocket's engines, destroying a Falcon 9 rocket and Amos-6, an Israeli communications satellite, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. No one was injured.

SpaceX is making design changes to the overwrapped pressure vessels and ""corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led"" to the potential reasons for the September accident, the company said.

The fiery explosion, photos of which were splashed across front pages, was a major setback in a year that also saw a spectacular, first-ever landing at sea. In April, thousands tuned into a live-stream to watch a Falcon 9 rocket launch and, roughly eight minutes later, touch down on an unmanned drone-ship bobbing in the Atlantic ocean. Reusable rockets are key to Musk's vision of opening access to space and ultimately building a human colony on Mars.

The Iridium NEXT constellation will replace the world's largest commercial satellite network of low-earth orbit satellites, Iridium Communications Inc. has said."
2432029428,"@marsbeyond @SpaceX Redmond is still flying below radar - not much info. SpaceX likely focusing on return 2 flight, then Falcon reuse."
2432030814,"After an exhaustive investigation, SpaceX engineers have identified the most likely cause of the spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket during a pre-launch test Sept. 1 that destroyed the booster and its $195 million satellite payload, the company announced Monday.

SpaceX engineers believe the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station mishap was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank.

Putting corrective actions in place, the company said Monday it plans to resume flights with a launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to boost 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations into orbit.

It is not yet known when SpaceX plans to resume flights from Cape Canaveral. Launch complex 41 at the Florida Air Force station was heavily damaged in the Sept. 1 mishap, and the company plans to use a repurposed space shuttle launch pad at the nearby Kennedy Space Center for its next Falcon 9 flight from Florida. Sources indicate the first flight from Kennedy will be another commercial mission. The next SpaceX flight to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, the company's 10th under contract to NASA, is expected to take place some time after the commercial mission.SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket uses super-cooled, or ""densified,"" liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene fuel to provide additional performance during ascent. To achieve and maintain the desired low temperatures, propellant loading begins just 35 minutes before launch.

To push propellants to the rocket's engines, the Falcon 9 uses highly pressurized helium stored in aluminum bottles, wrapped in a tough, insulating carbon composite material. The bottles, known as composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, are mounted inside the propellant tanks, submerged in frigid liquid oxygen and chilled kerosene.

On Sept. 1, about five minutes before a planned test firing of the Falcon's nine Merlin 1D first stage engines -- a routine pre-launch test for SpaceX -- the second stage suddenly exploded in a spectacular conflagration that was caught on video and widely seen around the world.

The rocket and its $195 million payload, a commercial communications satellite, were destroyed, causing heavy damage to launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Just 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first signs of trouble to the explosion.

""Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events,"" SpaceX said in a statement posted to its website. ""Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. ""To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.""

SpaceX is generally tight-lipped when it comes to technical details, and the statement posted Monday provided only a general overview of the team's findings. It said accident investigators ""concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed.""

""Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner,"" the company said.

Investigators believe those extremely low temperatures may have caused some of that trapped oxygen to solidify. In any case, when the tank was pressurized, trapped oxygen pushing against the carbon overwrap fibers likely generated friction ""leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.""

Liquid oxygen has a temperature of around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit, but SpaceX chills the propellant to around minus 340 degrees for use aboard the Falcon 9. The RP-1 kerosene fuel, which normally is stored at a room temperature 70 degrees, also is chilled. The lower temperatures increase the propellants' density.

A rocket engine's thrust is directly proportional to the rate propellants are consumed and expelled. By ""densifying"" the Falcon 9 propellants, more fuel can be stored and pumped through the engines, increasing performance.

While earlier rockets, including the Titan 2 booster used to launch NASA's Gemini spacecraft in the 1960s, used propellant cooling to increase density, and thus engine performance, the upgraded Falcon 9 is believed to be the first utilizing super-cooled cryogenic oxygen.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in 2015, when propellant cooling was first implemented in the Falcon 9, that ""we're sub-cooling the propellant, particularly the liquid oxygen, close to its freezing point, which increases the density quite significantly.""

Failure investigators ""identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solidified oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,"" the company said in its statement.

""The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.""

The company did not provide any details about those earlier helium loading procedures but said it plans to redesign the helium bottles in the long term ""to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.""

The Sept. 1 failure was the second involving the Falcon 9's second-stage helium pressurization system.

During a June 2015 launch to deliver supplies to the space station, a strut holding a second-stage helium tank in place inside the liquid oxygen tank failed, allowing the helium bottle to shoot up and crash into the top of the oxygen tank, triggering a catastrophic rupture.

It was SpaceX's first outright Falcon 9 failure in 19 launchings dating back to the rocket's maiden flight in June 2010. After taking steps to ensure all internal struts met design specifications, SpaceX launched nine successful missions in a row before the Sept. 1 launch pad disaster, all of them using densified propellants.

2432037407,SpaceX - go for launch in Jan 8th https://t.co/Y9yY7EaLWm
2432039453,"SpaceX says an investigation has concluded that the Sept. 1 explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket occurred due to the failure of a helium pressure vessel, and it's taking steps to avoid the problem for its return to flight, set for Jan. 8.

That launch will send 10 Iridium Next communication satellites into orbit from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. Meanwhile, repairs are continuing at SpaceX's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, where September's blow-up occurred during a pre-launch fueling test.

The California-based launch company's founder, Elon Musk, had said previously that the supercooled helium tanks played a role in the accident, which led to the fiery loss of the rocket and its commercial Amos-6 satellite payload. Today's update adds lots more detail to that diagnosis, and explains what SpaceX is doing to address the issue.

The investigation - led by SpaceX but also involving experts from the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Air Force, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board and elsewhere - checked readings from more than 3,000 channels of data, focusing on the 93 milliseconds between the first sign of an anomaly and the loss of the Falcon 9's second stage.

The analysis led investigators to focus on the composite-wrapped vessels that sit inside the second-stage liquid oxygen tank. Those vessels hold superchilled helium that helps maintain pressure in the oxygen tank.

After reviewing the data and video of the blow-up, and checking the debris, the investigators concluded that liquid oxygen pooled up in a void or a buckle between a helium vessel's aluminum inner liner and the carbon composite layer wrapped over the aluminum.

""When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap,"" SpaceX explained in today's update.

Investigators concluded that this is what caused the helium tank to fail, setting off a chain of events that resulted in the second-stage explosion. The helium was so cold that some of the liquid oxygen could have turned solid, increasing the likelihood of failure. SpaceX said it ran a variety of tests at its facilities in California and Texas to validate the investigation's findings.

SpaceX came up with corrective actions that it said would address the credible causes in the short term as well as in the long term.

In the short term, the company will go back to a tried-and-true, albeit slower, procedure for loading helium into the tanks at a warmer temperature. In the long term, SpaceX will change the design of the pressure tanks so that there are no buckles in which the liquid oxygen can pool. That should allow for faster helium loading procedures to be used again, SpaceX said.

""SpaceX greatly appreciates the support of our customers and partners throughout this process, and we look forward to fulfilling our manifest in 2017 and beyond,"" the company said. SpaceX's next customer, Iridium, voiced its approval as well.

""Iridium is pleased with SpaceX's announcement and targeted launch date of January 8 for the first #IridiumNEXT launch. #NEXTevolution https://t.co/zWdkK8FrLG

- Iridium Corporate (@IridiumComm) January 2, 2017

There was no official word on whether the FAA had signed off on the investigation's findings or the Jan. 8 launch date, but the fact that SpaceX provided a detailed update today suggests that it's anticipating the FAA's approval.

The months-long suspension of Falcon 9 launches had caused uncertainty for SpaceX's customers, and put a crimp in the privately held company's finances. SpaceX's next resupply mission to the International Space Station and its first reflight of a previously flown Falcon 9 booster are among the key launches that have been held up.

The end of the investigation is also likely to clear the way for the first flight of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, a heavy-lift rocket that's due to make its debut this year."

2432050644,"It's an exciting time to be alive as NASA, along with billionaires and their rockets, continue to push the envelope when it comes to space travel and exploration.

But it all comes at a pivotal time, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. As president, Trump will nominate a NASA administrator and will be tasked with setting a budget for the space program, which will then have to be approved by Congress.

The current proposed budget for NASA in 2017 is $19 billion - down $300 million from the previous year but still an improvement from the past decade, which saw the end of the space shuttle program. President-elect Donald Trump will step into his new role during a pivotal time for future space endeavors, as well, with NASA setting its sights on a Mars mission in the 2030s and preparing to end its dependence on Russia for rides to the International Space Station.

Whomever Trump nominates could set the tone for the future of the space program, including how NASA partners with the commercial space industry, according to Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space Systems and a founding member of SpaceX.

With Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel acting as a close Trump adviser, Cantrell said ""some of the more commercial thinking"" he brings ""is very healthy, and if Trump continues to do that, it will be very positive for NASA.""

Presidents are usually relatively hands-off with NASA; however, Cantrell sees an opportunity for Trump, who has previously called space ""terrific.""

""Occasionally you see presidents come in and provide a clear change in direction of leadership,"" he said, referring to John F. Kennedy's decision to go to the moon and George W. Bush's appointment of a NASA administrator who helped paved the way for partnerships with the private space industry.

""The potential is there for Trump to do the same thing,"" Cantrell said.

Since NASA grounded its shuttle program in 2011, the space agency has been buying seats aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule in order to send American astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

It likely won't happen in 2017, but expect to hear updates from NASA partners SpaceX and Boeing as both make strides in their testing of commercial crew vessels: When they are ready to shuttle humans, SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner would cost about $58 million per seat, according to NASA. By comparison, a seat aboard the Russian Soyuz has the heftier price tag of $81 million.

A Return to Flight for SpaceX

SpaceX is planning to return to flight in January - just four months after an anomaly destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and the satellite it had been set to carry into space.

Elon Musk's company is targeting a January launch, exact date to be determined, for Iridium's mobile communications fleet.

SpaceX's timeline is ambitious, but the company has pulled it off in the past. After its Dragon capsule exploded en route to the International Space Station, the company was sidelined for six months.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a member of the billionaire rocket club. As CEO of Blue Origin, he's largely kept quiet about the company's plans, instead telling the world after they've pulled off something impressive.

""They have been unpredictable from the start because there isn't much known about what their core path is,"" said Cantrell. ""I am fascinated to see what it is the guy has in mind. His style is very different from Elon's. Elon says what he wants to do and goes and gathers the money to do it. Bezos suddenly shows up with a fully functional vehicle that blows your mind.""

Blue Origin has been following a cycle of ""launch, land, and repeat,"" with its reusable New Shepard rocket and vehicle, which goes into sub-orbital space.

""I see it as a very bright year for the space internet,"" Cantrell said.

Building a space-based internet is not a new idea, but it's one that has taken off once again largely due to new technology and lower launch costs.

While a number of companies, including SpaceX, have expressed a desire to build a space-based internet, it's shaping up to be a big year for OneWeb.

The company, whose investors include The Virgin Group, Coca-Cola, Airbus, and Qualcomm, announced earlier this month it had received a $1.2 billion injection of capital, which will support production in a high volume satellite facility, according to the company.

""My bet is on OneWeb to get it going first,"" Cantrell said.

Virgin Galactic suffered a major setback with its SpaceShipTwo when it broke apart over the Mojave Desert in 2014, killing the co-pilot and seriously injuring the pilot, who was able to parachute to safety.

Earlier this month, Virgin Galactic marked its first major milestone since the crash when its new spaceship, the VSS Unity, successfully completed its first glide test.

When it comes to space tourism, Virgin Galactic has been one of the most visible companies setting imaginations wild with the idea of actually letting human tourists visit space.

""They aren't going to move as aggressively forward as the smaller companies launching unmanned stuff,"" Cantrell said. They'll work on ""getting the risk of losing human life down"" and showing their more than 700 customers who have been patiently waiting that they have a ""strong future."" Having spent nearly 20 years on the move in space, NASA's Cassini space probe will end its mission in September when it dives head-on into Saturn.

Before it slams into the ringed planet, Cassini will come as close as 1,012 miles above Saturn's clouds before it makes a fatal plunge into the atmosphere.

In a statement posted on its website, the company says they've isolated the problem that led to the September 1 explosion: a buildup of oxygen in the aluminum liner likely led to the failure of one of three composite overwrapped pressure vessels. They also said they've devised solutions to avoid these conditions and make sure a similar explosion doesn't happen again.

The conclusion comes after an investigation that included experts from NASA, the FAA, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board. Experts pored over 93 milliseconds of footage and worked through an ""extensive fault tree analysis"" to conclude what went wrong.

Space X's next rocket launch will be Jan. 8, from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex.

"
2432066951,"After months of uncertainty and delays, SpaceX can finally say when it expects to resume rocket launches following its September launchpad explosion. The private spaceflight outfit is now aiming for a return to flight on January 8th, when a Falcon 9 will carry an Iridium Next satellite into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. And crucially, SpaceX has narrowed down accident's likely cause to the point where it has solutions that should prevent a repeat accident.

Investigators have determined that the September incident was likely caused by super-cooled liquid oxygen building up in a ""void or buckle"" between a pressure vessel's aluminum liner and its carbon overwrap. If the oxygen gets trapped in a buckle, it can create friction that ignites the chemical... and, well, the whole rocket. To make matters worse, the loading temperature of helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, which increases the odds of it getting stuck and producing friction. The stopgap solution is to change the pressure vessel configuration to allow warmer helium, and to return to a ""proven"" helium loading setup. In the long run, however, SpaceX is planning to redesign the vessels so that buckles aren't even possible.

The timing of both the launch and the associated fixes is critical for the company. The 2016 explosion not only lost a valuable vehicle and its payload, but shook the trust for both clients and advocates of private space travel. Were Elon Musk and crew moving too quickly? SpaceX needs to show that it learned from its mistakes, and that catastrophic failures won't happen again for a long time, if ever."

2432103049,"New years bring new beginnings, and for SpaceX, that means a return to flight after a five-month dry spell. Having officially determined the cause of the infamous Falcon 9 ""anomaly"" at Cape Canaveral on September 1st, the rocket company is eyeing January 8th for its first launch of 2017.

SpaceX has been grounded ever since a Falcon 9 rocket loaded with a $95 million internet satellite exploded in an epic fireball last fall, taking with it a chunk of Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 40. The company has spent months investigating the anomaly under the oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration. Today, SpaceX released the final nitty gritty details on what went wrong-and with that, it hopes to put the incident in the past.

As Gizmodo previously reported , September's Falcon 9 failure was traced to a helium tank in the rocket's liquid oxygen second stage. Specifically, one of the second stage's ""composite overwrapped pressure vehicles"" (COPVs), which are used to maintain tank pressure, seems to have failed after oxygen accumulated between an inner aluminum liner and a carbon overwrap. ""When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail,"" SpaceX wrote on its website.

The company reports that it is taking corrective actions to address ""all credible causes [of failure] and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes.""

Having concluded the investigation into what Elon Musk described as SpaceX's "" most difficult and complex failure "" yet, the company is targeting next week for a return to flight. Its next launch payload, a fleet of Iridium NEXT communications satellites, is scheduled to blast off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on January 8th.

Soon after , SpaceX is expected to begin flying from Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Complex 39A, the site of myriad Apollo and Space Shuttle-era launches. The launchpad, which NASA leased to SpaceX in 2014, was originally slated for crewed Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights. But over the past year, SpaceX has been dropping hints that 39A may be used in the nearer term for un-crewed launches, as well. By the end of 2017, SpaceX may very well have four launch options-Kennedy, Cape Canaveral, Vandenberg, and a new site in South Texas."
2432154556,"SpaceX is ready to resume launches this month after finishing its investigation into the spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket last September.

The company plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket on January 8 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base outside of Los Angeles, boosting 10 Iridium NEXT communications satellites into orbit. The launch date is contingent upon Federal Aviation Administration approval, according to satellite manufacturer Iridium .

SpaceX and the FAA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

SpaceX launches have been suspended since September 1, after a pre-launch test at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida failed in a massive explosion . The rocket and its $195 million payload were destroyed, causing heavy damage to launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral.

SpaceX has been investigating the rocket failure with several federal agencies and believes the explosion was triggered by a problem in the Falcon 9's fueling system.

The investigation team ""identified several credible causes"" for the system failure, SpaceX said in an update posted to its site Monday, and the company has put fixes in place to ""address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes.""

It is unclear when SpaceX plans to resume launches in Cape Canaveral. Instead, the company reportedly plans to repurpose a space shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center for its next Falcon 9 flight from Florida. The first SpaceX launch from Kennedy will be a commercial mission, reported CBS News , with a delivery to the International Space Station expected to come some time after that commercial launch.

2432166812,"GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine Seen as Top Choice for NASA Chief, Wall Street Journal

""Boeing and other legacy contractors have rallied behind Doug Cooke, a former senior NASA official under President George W. Bush, people with knowledge of the situation say. Mr. Cooke is known as a critic of some commercial initiatives. Many of those serving on the formal NASA transition team share those views, while favoring greater emphasis on manned exploration missions to the moon and deeper into the solar system. The plans are largely built around NASA's proposed heavy lift rocket, dubbed the Space Launch System, and companion Orion capsule. By contrast, champions of commercial space interests, including supporters of billionaire Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Blue Origin LLC, a closely held rocket-making company run by Amazon.com Inc.'s founder and chairman Jeff Bezos, favor less federal direction and more public-private partnerships, people with knowledge of the situation say. They have pushed hard for Mr. Bridenstine as a likely change agent, and at this point seem to have the upper hand, the people added.""

Why the Moon Matters, Rep. Bridenstine

""While most satellites are not currently powered by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, next generation satellite architectures could utilize the lunar propellant if low-cost in-orbit servicing were available. Commercial operators will follow if the United States leads with its own constellations. Such leadership would require a whole-of-government approach with the interagency support of the newly reconstituted National Space Council. The objective is a self-sustaining, cis-lunar economy, whereby government and commercial operators save money and maximize the utilization of space through lunar resources.""

 Keith's note: The NASA Landing Team resumes work tomorrow. Charles Millier should be joining the festivities. No word yet as to whether Alan Lindenmoyer and Alan Stern's conflict of interest background checks have been completed. These three were added at the direction of Trump Tower in response to concerns that commercial space was not getting an equal seat at the table. As such there is a lot of nuancing going on with this Landing Team. Indeed, the commercial space faction sees this this as an ""away team"" opportunity while the status quo factions sees it as a ""boarding party"".

Meanwhile, anyone who claims to have an idea what is going on in the confusing world behind the scenes of the still-embryonic TrumpSpace policy effort has an equal chance of being wrong - or right - or both. Andy Pasztor has had a tendency to get things confused on this story, so ... that said, were I to venture a guess as to where the selection might be headed I would agree that the commercial faction within Team TrumpSpace has the edge, and, unless he decides to go for USAF, the job is probably Bridenstine's to decline. There is no obvious second choice from the commercial faction should Bridenstine not be named NASA Administrator - so do not count out the Status Quo/SLS/Alabama crowd just yet.

A personal opinion, if I may: Doug Cooke and the other members of the Griffin Clan on the Trump Landing Team and NASA represent the past - old fashioned ways of thinking that requires decades, eschews innovation, is addicted to political favoritism, and needs ever-larger buckets of money to keep going. That is the last thing that NASA needs right now - more of the same - especially when discretionary spending has a big bullseye painted on it. Bridenstine himself may be short on management skills, but he has managed to attract an impressively large amount of support from across the commercial space sector - where innovation and cost effectiveness are pre-requisites - and good management is the key to profitability. Going with the old way of doing things will inevitably doom NASA to increasing irrelevance. Alas, there is no guarantee that moving U.S. space efforts in more of a commercial direction will solve all of NASA's problems - but it does at least offer a chance to try things that have worked elsewhere.

2432216255,"SpaceX is aiming to return their workhorse Falcon-9 rocket to flight next Sunday with a fleet of 10 Iridium NEXT satellites. The mission, currently scheduled to lift-off on Jan. 8 at 10:28 a.m. Pacific Time from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., will mark SpaceX's 30th Falcon-9 and the first launch for SpaceX since a Sept. 1 explosion took out their rocket, Cape Canaveral launch complex, and their customer's AMOS-6 satellite.

The 10 satellites flying next weekend represent the first set of 70 total that Iridium is launching with SpaceX to replace their current constellation; all of which are contracted to fly on seven Falcon-9 launches over the next 18 months (prior to the AMOS-6 accident, Iridium wanted all their launches flown by the end of 2017).

A landing attempt of the Falcon-9 booster will occur far offshore minutes after launch, using the company's autonomous ""Just Read The Instructions"" drone ship as a landing pad.

In the time since the Sep. 1 explosion, the accident investigation has focused heavily on a breach in the cryogenic helium system of the rocket's second stage liquid oxygen tank, with special attention narrowed to one of the three composite over wrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the LOX tank.

Having worked with numerous agencies, including NASA, the FAA, U.S. Air Force and NTSB, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company today released final results of the investigation, as well as outlined some of the actions they intend to take moving forward to prevent another AMOS-6 incident from happening again.

-----------------------

Over the past four months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Air Force (USAF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), along with several industry experts, have collaborated with SpaceX on a rigorous investigation to determine the cause of the anomaly that occurred September 1 at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This investigation team was established according to SpaceX's accident investigation plan as approved by the FAA. As the primary federal licensing body, the FAA provided oversight and coordination for the investigation.

Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events - there were just 93 milliseconds from the first sign of anomalous data to the loss of the second stage, followed by loss of the vehicle. Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris. To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.

The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.

Each stage of Falcon 9 uses COPVs to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure, and each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap. The recovered COPVs showed buckles in their liners. Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail. In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.

The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.

SpaceX greatly appreciates the support of our customers and partners throughout this process, and we look forward to fulfilling our manifest in 2017 and beyond.

-----------------------

Launch Complex-40 took serious damage from the explosion Sept. 1, and Space Florida recently requested $5 million in funds from the Florida Department of Transportation for help with ""infrastructure improvements"" on KSC pad 39A for SpaceX, who currently has a 20-year lease for the historic launch pad, since December 2014.

The next SpaceX launch from Florida will fly off historic pad 39A, the same pad where missions to the moon and numerous space shuttle missions left the Earth from."
2432226602,"Barely three months after one of its rockets blew up on the launchpad - destroying a $200 million Facebook satellite with it - SpaceX said Monday that it plans to try again this weekend.

The new launch date was on the at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 1.

The ""anomaly"" - SpaceX's word - was caused when supercold helium led carbon fibers and aluminum to cool at different rates on the second of the rocket's two stages, the company said. That opened gaps between two layers of overwrap, where liquid oxygen escaped and got trapped, it said.

That, in turn, caused one of the protective layers to ""buckle,"" or fail. Static ignited the trapped oxygen, setting off a chain of catastrophic explosions, SpaceX said. The Falcon rocket was to have launched an AMOS-6 communications satellite for a Facebook-Eutelsat joint venture to extend Internet access to underserved parts of the world. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the loss but promised that ""we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.""

SpaceX, a private space venture run by billionaire inventor Elon Musk, said Monday that its engineers have managed to rejigger the configuration of the rocket's helium containers, moderating the temperature of the helium and presumably eliminating buckling in the overwrap layer.

If it's successful, the next launch, tentatively schedule for Sunday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, will put 10 satellites into orbit to upgrade and replace some of the units in the Iridium Communications satellite constellation, a system of 66 satellites that provide voice and data coverage around the world.

"
2432244555,"SpaceX plans to resume flights as early as next week after finding the cause of an explosion that destroyed a rocket and satellite on a Florida launch pad in September.

The Hawthorne, California-based company is aiming for a Sunday, Jan. 8, flight from Vandenberg Air Force Base, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday (http://lat.ms/2irBTvc). The launch still needs approval by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The company said its investigation of the Sept. 1 explosion found that a tank failed within the larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank.

SpaceX plans to launch 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc. on a Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites will be used to provide mobile communications on land, sea and air.

Iridium says it in a tweet that it is pleased with the SpaceX's announcement and target launch date.

SpaceX had said it expected to return to flight as soon as November. But that anticipated launch date slipped back to December, and then January.

""Clearly, they're being extra cautious,"" said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst for the Teal Group. ""SpaceX usually pushes ahead a lot faster. So it seems like they're not rushing ahead at this point, which is a good thing.""

The explosion at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station destroyed a satellite that was to be managed by Israeli satellite operator Spacecom and was also to help Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg bring high-speed internet access to remote parts of Africa.

SpaceX said Monday that it pored through 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data that spanned just 93 milliseconds from the first sign of trouble to the explosion."

2432266024,"2017 and my first big post.

Number one, and most importantly, welcome to a new year and a fresh set of possibilities and opportunities that could help us change the world.

Clearly, we have all followed the overwhelmingly expressed social media view that 2016 was a bust with fear expressed for what 2017 might bring.

Time to move on... we get what we allow and we get what we tolerate. Many have gotten what they wanted, even if you didn't.

So, take your passion, your commitment, your hope or fear, and your desire to better the world and channel it into positive ideas, actions, programs and activities to make it happen. No one is stuck with anything, and that is the beauty of it all.

Which leads me to my blind guesses for 2017...

Now, some call them forecasts, others label them as predictions, and the most audacious as prophecies.

And what they all have in common is that for way too many years most of the industry seers have been wrong time after time after time.

Don't get me started on 2016... Brexit, Trump, ISIS, Pokemon Go. Pathetic really, but the reasons are always the same:

""Polls apart: UK experts red-faced after failing to forecast win for Cameron's Conservatives."" - Fox News

""Sanders' Michigan victory will count as among the greatest polling errors in primary history."" - Nate Silver, FiveThirtyEight.com

""Understanding American politics just got a lot more difficult and, not coincidentally, a lot more interesting to figure out than what it was a couple of months ago. ... This year, one could be smart, reasonable and, nonetheless, very, very wrong because this time it is different."" - Dante Scala

Yet, interestingly enough, I see a common thread. A simple theme that weaves in and out of all of the excuses.

""The world is so unpredictable. Things happen suddenly, unexpectedly. We want to feel we are in control of our own existence. In some ways we are, in some ways we're not. We are ruled by the forces of chance and coincidence."" - Paul Auster

""No one really knows why humans do what they do."" - David K. Reynolds

""But,instead of what our imagination makes us suppose and which we worthless try to discover,life gives us something that we could hardly imagine."" - Marcel Proust

People are not machines. People are not numbers or symbols in an algorithm. There is a power and beauty to human spontaneity that transcends the latest so called disruption, that defies the DIGIBABBLERS.

Now, having said that, and to give you an incentive to continue, I will tell you that my thematic blind guess for 2016 was that there would be consequential data blips, causing events like surprise elections. And, I am proud to say, I remained a naysayer all year long and saw no surprises other than my continued amazement that others were constantly surprised.

All of which proves nothing more than that my cloudy crystal ball--as murky as ever--is as good as anyone's.

A word on crystal balls.

In my favorite movie of all time, MGM's 1939, never-equaled classic The Wizard of Oz, crystal balls play a prominent role and best portray their use and impact.

You see, both the wizard and the witch manipulate simple data, but more importantly, manipulate their audience by showing, predicating and suggesting scenarios and situations that were already in the head of the watcher-in this case Dorothy. Call it confirmation bias, a topic I have written on before.

Frankly, it's the oldest con in the world, and in my opinion, the basis for so much of the disfunction we seem to be swirling in.

So, if you expect to hear about on-going disruption, brilliant world-changing innovation at CES, a drone-based society controlled from our VR existence...read no further. I apologize, this ain't for you.

However, if you are ready to take a leap, be a dissident, not follow the herd...stay with me a paragraph or two more. Ok, maybe three...

Thematically, I believe we will see a continued shift back towards a PEOPLE FIRST orientation. The bottom line of which is that finally we will see a slowing down of the insipid discussions of digital first or mobile first or VR, AI, wearables, drones, autonomous cars, planes, boats or anything else first.

Let's be clear. We live in a digital world that enables all of the above and more. Yet in and of themselves, they are merely tools that we employ to make our lives better (one would hope), make the world better (one would equally hope), and ensure our continued future (one can only hope and pray).

But let me be specific as to how I see it playing out...or not (I said it was a blind guess).

1. Algorithms and anything programmatic will lose their luster this year. Not that we won't use them, in fact, we have always relied on versions of the same-long before digital-but there will be a movement towards adding human insight, human emotion, appreciation for the serendipity of it all. My sense is that the luddites will be those who still insist that they can make you buy the purple pants with the pink embroidered whales that you don't want, simply by following your so called data trail. Frankly, I'd stay away from them and instead gravitate towards the folks who combine the two.

2. Media will also return to its human roots. After all, it is humans who consume it...no? LOL...except for the trolls. By this I mean we will see a return to more accountability for placement of advertising and yes, by using that term I mean anything that is out there to influence an audience in any way. The excuse that your beautiful brand content (I'm being PC, call it what you will) shows up in the center of racist incitement because you bought audience programmatically will no longer wash. The dilemma, of course, is that those racists must be your audience...no? After all it was the algorithm that chose them. Another PEOPLE FIRST issue...

3. A follow up to this is the fake news online that has become such a big business for all. The creators make money, the platforms and publishers make money, and the brands find audience. My personal view is that we will swirl around this one for a long time.

I don't believe that any of the platforms can or should be held liable for fake news. It is not a new problem nor will it go away. It plagued us long before Facebook and will continue long after. Only publishers can be liable. So number one, the big publishers like Rolling Stone and even The New York Times need to police themselves and employ more fact checkers. Number two, brands, as I mentioned before, will have to adopt stricter guidelines regarding placement, and some will. And again, I believe we will see a people's movement begin to coalesce around this issue. Where we will see movement is on hatred. Platforms can no longer allow loose definitions of what hatred is or allow incitement to masquerade as free speech. I see both of these issues related (see the libel case involving David Irving and Deborah Lipstadt in the UK which actually dealt with both)...lies that incite have ulterior motives and come from places that cannot be countenanced by a free society.

News media will grow in importance again. At least those that are able to be convincingly open and news focused. The world is craving authenticated and trusted sources, particularly in times of crisis and upheaval. I expect to see some interesting developments here.

4. TV will continue to grow in importance. And by this I mean TV in all its glory across all its platforms and devices. The trend of buying great series and shows from countries other than your own will continue, as Netflix has shown that subtitles do indeed work. However, the issue will not be content or what platform or device you watch it on-as confusing as it is... do I watch on my big TV through Samsung, Fios, Xbox, Amazon or link my iPad? I see the real issue being how do I pay for it all? Everyone will keep producing their own unique content forcing me to buy in to their platforms or service, but 80% of their offering will be the same as everyone else's and btw I want that live content too-sports, news and whatever else. My cloudy view? Watch for the next cable-like consolidation offer. I'm ready to bet that advertising will play a key role in reducing the price.

P.S. take a look at Apple's new app icon for video entertainment before you comment...

5. Experiences ...let me not forget experiences. A term that has been perverted, subverted and highjacked by the worst of the DIGIBABBLE crowd. Experiences are as old as living organisms and continue to evolve as we do. But there are no experiences like live events, where the crowd becomes a living, breathing entity, bringing more life to each participant.

The power of the place transcends mere physical rules. Through live broadcasting the longer tail of the tale itself lives on. New Year's Eve around the world, The Super Bowl in the US, Cup games anywhere, concerts and plays....Experiences will remain...EXPERIENCES...and yes VR and AR and whatever will enhance their afterlife-but such has always been true... they're an evolution of how we remember and not a proxy for being there.

6. There will be another shakeup in the social platform world . Facebook will continue its dominance but if it continues in the path of Yahoo (that is thinking it can be everything) it will water itself down. Snapchat will continue to ""pivot"" as it opens itself up to more revenue opportunities and as its IPO looms, expect more changes like data sharing... after all, these were the folks who said they'd never sell advertising. Twitter needs to find a place for itself. Donald Trump will keep it alive but it needs purpose. People will begin to realize that 15mgs of fame is fleeting and that in the ever-shrinking, we-serve-you-what-we-think-you-want universe their ""choices"" are limiting them and also limiting their development. There will be pushback.

7. Finally, I think that people will once again seek to take back some control of this planet's destiny. Disruption is stale. We will see more dissidence...more coalescence of people in movements to solve problems and not the DIGIBABBLE of believing that a drone delivering you pizza is anyway better than the kid who has brought it for over a hundred years.

To that end...

We will see a shift from public to private development . The political climate will give birth to highly innovative and ambitious private companies and causes that seek to change the world for the better. DISSIDENT companies, a conspiracy to change the world: Tesla, SpaceX, Hyperloop, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic.

A case in point is Bill Gates' new energy venture fund:

Bill Gates is launching a $1bn fund for new energy technologies in a sign of how the private sector is continuing to invest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions despite the shadow cast over US climate policy by the election of Donald Trump...Learning from the failures of other funds investing in emerging energy technologies, Mr Gates said his $1bn Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund aimed to be ""patient capital"", potentially holding investments for 15-20 years.- FT

Think about that ""patient capital"" breaking the quarterly cycle that spanned DIGIBABBLE and the shallowness of disruption...profit will be judged by the success of the mission and not by the appetite of Wall Street for hype.

And last but not least, as this is CES week, going in, all the hype will be on innovation of every sort you can imagine. Going out, watch for the stories on the next big screen you will buy...and so it goes.

Like I do every year, I will hold myself accountable and will report back on how wrong or right I was....meanwhile let's turn to a real expert.

Robert Kahn is the co-inventor of the TCP/IP protocols and was responsible for originating DARPA's Internet program. In December 1997, President Bill Clinton presented the U.S. National Medal of Technology to Kahn and his colleague, Vinton Cerf, for founding and developing the Internet. This is what he said:

""You can't gaze into the crystal ball and see the future. What the Internet is going to be in the future is what society makes it.""

And there you have it...what will be is what we decide...not some algorithmic AI or DIGIBABBLE disruption."

BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Good evening, everyone. Happy New Year and welcome to this special holiday edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Sue Herera is off tonight.

Well, 2017 is here. With the fresh calendar, of course, comes renewal and resolutions. And while we can`t help you fulfill your promises to work out more and lose that five or ten pounds, we can help you get your finances in shape by shedding light on what may happen in the coming months.

And we begin, as we often do, with the markets. Stocks are coming off a powerful year-end rally. But there are questions now about how much gas is left in the market`s tank.

Bob Pisani takes a look at what may shape equities in the year ahead.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stock rally, oil rally. Everyone`s bullish right now. But that`s going to get tougher in 2017.

Here`s three predictions. First, the stock rally will continue but will hit major headwinds. The S&P 500 will hit a series of historic highs again within Donald Trump`s first 100 days but that will be it. The problem? Market participants are anticipating higher revenues and earnings due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus but the actual company guidance will not match those high expectations.

Second, the oil rally will be a bust. As oil heads towards $60, American producers will ramp up production. That will keep prices down and the much-discussed agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members to cut oil production will collapse among charges of widespread cheating.

Finally, 2017 will be the year stock ownership expands. The American public has seen declining levels of stock ownership for years. Only 52 percent of households own stocks and most stock is own by the top 10 percent of households. But rising GDP and greater optimism on the economy will finally reverse those trends in 2017 and folks who abandoned the market after the financial crisis in 2008 will return and start buying stocks once again.

For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.

MATHISEN: Technology, financials, and health care are three sectors that could majorly influence your portfolio this year. And that`s because they are the largest groups in the S&P 500.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The NASDAQ surged to new highs this year and 2017 promises more fireworks. With dynamic gadgets, services, and the ongoing cloud wars.

First, Google`s head is in the cloud.

The search giant controls just 5 percent of the cloud infrastructure market. In 2017, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will double that, putting pressure on industry leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Second, Trump doesn`t scare Cook.

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump went after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for manufacturing overseas, saying he wants apple to bring iPhone production home to the U.S. That`s not going to happen. The economics of bringing large scale, low-skill assembly line work back here don`t make sense. Tim Cook will counter that he already directly employs some 80,000 people.

Third, the tech IPO pipeline heats up for enterprise.

Snap makes its public debut next year. But it`s the smaller, enterprise- focused startups that will dominate the IPO market in 2017. Okta, MuleSoft and App Dynamics will go public.

Big established companies want to see the financials of their vendors before opening up their wallets.

WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Coming in to perform not just for 2016 but most of the last decade, banks have taken off in the fourth quarter, not least because of the election. As we head into 2017, here are the things to watch:

The year curve will be key. Of all the fourth quarter factors that have driven the bank`s rally, the most important is the rise in interest rates. Whether the yield curve maintains its recent rise and steepening will be the major factor for banks` share prices.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) remains the most geared toward interest rates, which is why it has performed so well since the election.

Other Trump related changes -- the key thing for Trump is whether he can deliver more positive surprises as 2017 arrives.

In terms of deregulation, low corporate taxes and repatriation of cash overseas, all of which is positive for banks. But how much is already priced in? A glance at how valuations have changed in the last few months shows the improvement in investors` sentiment to the sector, but also the scope for it to improve still further based on long term averages.

Risks remain. The main outstanding risk is credit quality.

Loan growth has been fairly strong in 2016, and fears remain about how late in the cycle the economy is. A spike in provisions would derail the positive turn in sentiment we`ve seen in recent months. The improvement in oil prices in Q4 has been another short term positive in this regard.

BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Repealing Obamacare is easy. The challenge for the Trump administration and Republicans in 2017 will be coming up with a replacement plan and pulling off a smooth transition.

Three predictions?

First, repeal and maintain Obamacare. Republicans will repeal the ACA, especially the unpopular individual mandate, early next year. But replacing it could take a couple of years.

In the meantime, they`ll keep Obamacare subsidies and to prevent a collapse of the market, they may come up with funding to offset insurers` losses, funding they opposed under Obama as a bailout.

Second, M&A on pause. With uncertainty surrounding changes to the Medicaid and Medicare government health programs, which are driving growth and health care.

Insurers and hospitals will refrain from big mergers in 2017 and instead work on partnerships aim at bringing down costs.

Which brings us to more pay for value. Hospitals are already feeling the pressure.

Next year, drug makers, distributors, and pharmacy benefit firms will be on the hot seat to deliver lower prices too.

MATHISEN: Let`s turn now to Mark Luschini for his outlook on the U.S. stock market. He`s chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Happy New Year, Mark. Good to have you with us.

MARK LUSCHINI, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Thank you. Same to you, Tyler.

MATHISEN: You know, who can forget last year when the stock market for the six weeks had about as rocky a start as I remember, and I`ve been following this a long time. There are a lot of -- there are some similarities. One would be a December interest rate hike, both years that happened, but a lot of differences.

What are the odds that we get off to a rocky start in 2017?

LUSCHINI: Tyler, my judgment, those odds are pretty low. The dissimilarities I think outweigh the similarities by some order of magnitude, particularly since a lot of it was concerned about the fact that we did get a rate hike, but it was the first one in almost a decade. And so, while it took quite a while, a year, in fact, to get the second one, I think it was so widely anticipated, and the Fed has nurtured along a certain narrative with regard to how delicate they`re going to be in subsequent rate hikes, that the market is prepared for that.

Secondly, we`re not seeing the exogenous issues lurking quite to the same order of magnitude as we had last year, particularly as it relates to China, a lot of questions about exactly what the pace of Chinese economic growth is. But nonetheless, while it`s decelerated, the worry last year at this time was that it was decelerating towards something like a hard landing and it was going to suck in with it all of the emerging market complex that rely on Chinese growth for exporting commodity related goods and services.

That`s not the case this time around. And, therefore, I have a more sanguine view about how we start the year, even if we have to overcome some correction here in the meantime, simply to work off some of the euphoria in equity markets.

MATHISEN: How can I make money this year? What sectors, what individual names do you pinpoint for 2017?

LUSCHINI: Sure. Well, giving the aforementioned with regard to one of the sectors that was mentioned, financials, I agree that`s a sector that I think is likely to prosper. A steeper yield curve ought to help net interest margins, banks are still from evaluation standpoint, attractive. Stronger, certainly steadier economic growth ought to bode well for lending activity. And at the end of the day, if we see any kind of deregulation regarding Dodd/Frank, that ought to boost the ability to put capital reserves to work.

(CROSSTALK)

MATHISEN: Do you love the money center banks that have multiple platforms and big trading operations? Or do you like banks that do banking?

LUSCHINI: I like banks that do banking more so than the former, Tyler. An example would be PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC) on their front, kind of a super regional, if you will.

(CROSSTALK)

MATHISEN: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) play there.

LUSCHINI: Well, I`ll eat my own cooking on that one as well. But nonetheless, yes, I think it has a great footprint up and down the East Coast, and a great franchise and one in which, again, should benefit from all to things I`d mentioned, economically and/or structurally.

MATHISEN: A lot of the defense sectors led the way in the first half of 2016. Is this a year to get defensive on the defensives?

LUSCHINI: I don`t think so. I think, though, that the prospects for interest rates moving measurably higher from here, which is to say something with a 3 1/2 to 4 handle seems unlikely. But I think directionally, that`s going to be the way prices work. And so, that`s going to be a bit of a headwind into those classic interest rate sensitive sectors, the so-called defensives. And therefore, I think what you want to be poised to do is take advantage of this pullback particularly, to walk into the some of the economically sensitive sectors like financials, like energy and some of the consumer discretionary basing industries.

MATHISEN: Got to leave it there. Mark, thanks, and happy New Year again. Mark Luschini with Janney Montgomery Scott.

LUSCHINI: You`re welcome.

MATHISEN: Now to the economy. More broadly, it hit a number of milestones, of course, back in 2016. The Federal Reserve did raise interest rates, as we were just discussing. Growth accelerated, especially toward the end of the year. The unemployment rate continued to drop.

And the housing market saw prices hit a new peak. So, what should you watch over the next 12 months?

Diana Olick has a look at housing. But, first, Steve Liesman with an outlook for the broader economy.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Predictions for the economy in 2017 depend chiefly on how much a President-elect Donald Trump`s ambitious agenda gets through the new Republican Congress. All of that leads to one easy prediction for 2017, we`re about to see a whole lot more stock and bond market volatility when it comes to the making of economic policy than we`ve seen in the past.

Congress leaks like a sieve and everyone likes to talk. So, the chance of one proposal or another becoming law will go and up down with each newsflash. It goes without saying that Congress will become at least as important as the Fed at moving if not the whole market, and certain parts of it, like banking stocks when it comes to reforming or repealing Dodd/Frank or health care when it comes to Obamacare.

Second prediction, the Fed will hike twice, but likely three times, depending upon how quickly new fiscal programs get put in place.

And the final prediction, growth will accelerate to the 2.5 to 3 percent range sustained growth north of 3 percent will likely elude the next president, at least for next year.

DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The housing market was on a tear this year. Sales and construction surging ahead. But 2017 will see big changes.

Home sales will slow. Don`t get me wrong, there is plenty of demand for homes. But listings continue to drop and mortgage rates are starting to rise. Younger potential buyers may want to get out of those pricey rentals. But with affordability weakening, they may just not have the means.

Mortgage rates will rise. Mortgage rates spiked after the presidential election and the gains will continue, albeit at a more moderate pace. A potentially stronger economy and job growth are fueling the rates, but will not be enough to counter the higher cost, especially for first time buyers of getting a loan.

On the other hand, if the president-elect does make a big move into banking deregulation, it could get easier to get a mortgage. Mortgages more expensive but more available.

Home prices will cool. The spike in mortgage rates has already made homes for expensive for buyers. So, sellers may have to come down a bit if they want to get that fast offer. Tight supply has been pushing prices higher far faster than income growth and in a lot of markets, prices are becoming unsustainable.

They`re unlikely to drop, but the gains should shrink, if only that were true for rents, which continue to push through the roof.

For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MATHISEN: Still ahead, the one prediction many are making for 2017 is that Washington will be -- unpredictable.

(MUSIC)

MATHISEN: One of 2016`s biggest surprises, of course, was perhaps Donald Trump`s White House win. And later this month, he`ll be sworn in as the 45th president of the U.S.

So, what can investors expect from a Trump administration?

John Harwood takes a look.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If the 2016 campaign taught us anything, it is the unpredictability of everything about Donald J. Trump. So, anyone making predictions about his first year in the White House, not to mention those of us who thought he would never get there in the first place, better do it with a lot of humility.

So, here goes. In 2017, President Donald Trump will sign tax reform into law. But it won`t be comprehensive tax reform of both the individual and corporate systems. He`ll focus on international tax reform with the goal of returning corporate profits to the U.S. and raising money to finance his infrastructure spending plans.

At least one of President Trump`s cabinet picks will be defeated by the Senate. Even though Republicans control more than enough votes, opposition Democrats will look for opportunities to peel off a few moderate Republicans to block Trump picks they consider too far out of the mainstream. Target (NYSE:TGT) number one: Health and Human Services Secretary Designee Tom Price who favors big changes to Medicare and Medicaid.

And finally, the incoming president will not rip up the nuclear deal the outgoing president struck with Iran, even though Donald Trump criticized it during the campaign. U.S. allies Britain and France were part of that deal and so was Russia, the U.S. adversary Mr. Trump wants better relations with. The new president may embrace stricter monitoring of the deal, but getting rid of it altogether is just not worth the trouble and the risk.

For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m John Harwood.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MATHISEN: An across the board tax cuts is what President-elect Trump has promised from the wealthy down through the middle class and below. But how could his proposed tax cuts impact you?

Patrick Chovanec is chief strategist at Silver Crest Asset Management.

Patrick, welcome. Good to have you with us.

John Harwood just said that he expects that the focus in tax reform will be on international corporate taxation and repatriation of monies held overseas and maybe not so much on individual tax reform. Do you agree with that?

PATRICK CHOVANEC, SILVER CREST ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST: I think we have to see. You know, the Congress wants to move forward with tax cuts, both personal and corporate. There is certainly a windfall to be gained from bringing back profits from overseas.

But, you know, I think you`re hearing a lot of different things from a lot of different people in the Trump administration and from Congress about what the priorities are going to be.

MATHISEN: I remember writing a cover story for my former employer, the last time there was tax reform, 1986, and I basically led by saying tax reform equals lower rates plus less deductions. Is that the same formula this time around?

CHOVANEC: The question is whether they intend for tax reform to be revenue neutral or not. If it`s revenue neutral, you have to -- if you lower rates, you have to broaden the base. You have to get it back through getting rid of exclusions, deductions, credits. If they just want cuts, well then, they`re going to have to deal with the consequences of a much larger deficit.

MATHISEN: A lot of people watching this program are active investors. Will capital gains rates go down next year?

CHOVANEC: I think they will. But again, this is the thing. A lot of people are all excited about tax cuts. And they need to look at the other side of the equation, which is how are they going to pay for these tax cuts. There`s the --

MATHISEN: How is the government going to pay for those tax cuts?

CHOVANEC: How is the government going to pay for the tax cuts, especially if they want it to be not ballooning the deficit? So, you have a situation -- people are saying, for instance, Wall Street analysts are saying, 35 percent corporate taxes go down to 15 percent or 20 percent, that`s a big windfall for companies, but not if they lose a lot of the deductions.

MATHISEN: Lose the ability to deduct interest, for example.

CHOVANEC: Exactly.

MATHISEN: Or they don`t have as rapid depreciation as some have been saying. Which deduction on the individual side of the ledger is the one that you think is the most vulnerable in the sort of game-playing situation here that`s going to go on on Capitol Hill?

CHOVANEC: Well, the think that they`re talking about is the deductibility of state and local taxes.

MATHISEN: Whoa.

CHOVANEC: Which is --

MATHISEN: In a high tax state, that`s a big matter.

CHOVANEC: Exactly. And that`s why in 1986, when that was put on the table, that was immediately shot down by representatives from high tax states like California and New York. The question is whether they`ll have the same firepower in a Republican Congress to block it.

MATHISEN: Those were not Trump states, New York, California, New Jersey --

CHOVANEC: They were not. But there are Republican congressmen from those states. And for many of the people in those states, that would turn a tax cut potentially into a tax hike.

MATHISEN: It is going to be a fascinating year to watch taxes.

CHOVANEC: Indeed.

MATHISEN: Patrick, thank you. Happy New Year.

Patrick Chovanec with Silver Crest Asset Management.

All right. The defense sector could see big changes in the year ahead. President-elect Trump has pledged to increase military spending. And he has already focused attention on some of the biggest companies in the industry.

Morgan Brennan looks at what`s ahead for defense.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In 2016, Syria`s civil war escalated. North Korea tested more nukes. And U.S. agencies linked Russia to election-related hacks.

In 2017, Russian tensions will mount. The Iranian nuclear deal will be questioned, and China will further flex its muscle in the South China Sea.

First, it`s all about the budget. And the budget will increase, despite sequestration. Details will be key with more focus on cost efficiencies, when President-elect Trump releases the proposal this spring.

Second, the nuclear triad could become a diad as contractors jockey for the new Minutemen 3 contract. Under the new administration, the fate of the land-based leg of the nuclear arsenal could come into question, even as modernization moves forward for the Navy`s Ohio class replacement subs built by General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and the Air Force`s B-21 stealth bomber from Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).

Third, the race to secure space will take off. Call this the other infrastructure plan. As the Pentagon fortifies a satellite system that China and Russia have been developing weaponry to be able to disable. Expect more contracts, more launches, more potential business for Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and others.

One wild card? SpaceX, which finally landed a big military contract for a 2018 launch. But on the heels of a Falcon rocket explosion, first, it`s got to get back into space.

MATHISEN: Coming up, will Americans hit the road and head to showrooms to buy a record number of cars this year?

(MUSIC)

MATHISEN: Changes may be in store for the biotech and pharmaceutical industries this year. The sectors garnered a lot of attention last year from both Congress and the president-elect for the high price of medicine. So, what`s ahead for 2017?

Meg Tirrell takes a look.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If investors expected smooth sailing for drug company stocks after Republican swept the U.S. election, they were in for a surprise. Uncertainty in the drug industry is as high as ever. And the focus for 2017 will continue to be on drug prices, the FDA, and M&A.

Here is what to expect:

First, pricing pressure. Donald Trump says he`s going to bring drug prices down. He could look to legislation to do it but most likely, it will be continued public pressure on drug companies. Expect also increasing scrutiny of the rest of the health care system with mounting pressure on middlemen like drug distributors and pharmacy benefits managers.

Next, an eye on FDA. After two years of historic highs on new drug approvals, medicine cleared in the U.S. sank to six-year lows in 2016. 2017 brings multiple pieces of legislation affecting how we regulate drugs, both branded and generic.

Finally, M&A hope or hype? Investors` hopes for a biotech rebound rest on a Trump tax holiday boosting buying. Big pharma and biotech companies hold billions in cash overseas. And the expectation is that if they bring it back at a lower tax rate, they`ll gobble up smaller companies.

On buyers` wish list, companies working on drugs for cancer and rare diseases, seen as more insulated from pricing pressure.

MATHISEN: A recent report by the International Air Transport Association shows the airlines sector is poised to pose a record profit in 2016, helped largely by low fuel prices. Another group that also benefitted from cheaper gas was, of course, autos. That industry on pace to deliver record sales for 2017.

But as Phil LeBeau reports, 2017 may paint a different picture for both sectors.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Pardon the pun, but in 2017, airlines are trying to fly through the type of turbulence that could keep profits and airline stocks from flying higher.

First, the battle of basic airfares raises the question of whether airlines can finally grow passenger revenue.

In the fight to keep from losing passengers to low cost carriers, larger airlines like Delta have rolled out basic fares. They may be filling seats, but those cheap seats and that competition is keeping airfares down. Good for travelers. Not for the bottom line of airlines.

Second, congestion at America`s biggest airports is not going away.

For all the talk about fixing America`s airports, it`s the air traffic control system that needs to be upgraded. The FAA has made progress. Still, at the largest airports, you can expect some rough days in the next year. The good news? The TSA security lines that we saw in 2016 are unlikely to return due to greater staffing by airlines and airports.

Finally, some fliers could be in store for a better experience in the air.

United`s new Polaris brand is a major upgrade of its business class service. Meanwhile, American is adding premium economy to more international routes. And Delta is experimenting with bringing back complimentary meals on some of its transcontinental flights. Overall, if you`re flying in the U.S. next year, be prepared for packed planes.

Buckle (NYSE:BKE) up and get ready for the auto industry to hit the gas on new technology in the next year. That will drive three big stories behind the wheel in 2017.

First, new autonomous drive systems will mean more of us taking our hands off the wheel.

Tesla, GM and other automakers will roll out features next year where more cars will do the driving for short periods of time. But automakers will stress drivers remain in control. A fully autonomous drive car, we`re still years from seeing that expand beyond limited testing.

Second, in 2017, we`ll find out if America embraces lower-priced electric cars.

The Chevy Bolt with a range over 200 miles will be sold all of next year, starting on the West Coast. Meanwhile, Tesla`s model 3 is scheduled to be delivered late in 2017. Let`s see if there are strong sales for two models that will be priced under $40,000.

Third, America`s love affair with trucks and SUVs will stay red-hot in 2017.

Right now, almost 60 percent of the vehicles sold are trucks and SUVs. That will continue next year, especially if gas prices stay in check. And if the economy remains strong, we could see record auto sales next year.

NASA have compiled their favourite photos of 2016, capturing rare cosmic events, rockets unleashing ferocious power and life as an astronaut.

2017 brings with it somewhat uncertain times when it comes to the specificities of NASA's operations due to President-elect Donald Trump , so it's nice to look back at just what the space agency acheived last year.

There are 66 photos in its roundup for the year, but we've picked a handful of our own personal favourites.

2432337523,"After an intensive four month investigation into why a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded without warning on the launch pad last September, the company today announced the failures likely cause as well as plans of a rapid resumption of flights as soon as next Sunday, Jan. 8, from their California launch complex - carrying a lucrative commercial payload of 10 advanced mobile relay satellites to orbit for Iridium Communications.

""Targeting return to flight from Vandenberg with the @IridiumComm NEXT launch on January 8,"" SpaceX announced on their website today, Monday, Jan. 2., 2017.

""Our date is now public. Next Sunday morning, Jan 8 at 10:28:07 pst. Iridium NEXT launch #1 flies!"" Iridium Communications CEO Matt Desch quickly confirmed by tweet today, Jan 2.

SpaceX has been dealing with the fallout from the catastrophic launch pad explosion that eviscerated a Falcon 9 and its expensive $200 million Israeli commercial payload in Florida without warning, during a routine preflight fueling test on Sept. 1, 2016, at pad 40 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

After the Sept. 1 accident at pad 40, SpaceX initiated a joint investigation to determine the root cause with the FAA, NASA, the US Air Force and industry experts who have been ""working methodically through an extensive fault tree to investigate all plausible causes.""

""We have been working closely with NASA, and the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] and our commercial customers to understand it,"" said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Via the ""fault tree analysis"" the Sept. 1 anomaly has been traced to a failure in one of three helium storage tanks located inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank of the Falcon 9 rocket, according to a statement released by SpaceX today which provided some but not many technical details.

The failure apparently originated at a point where the helium tank ""buckles"" and accumulates oxygen - ""leading to ignition"" of the highly flammable liquid oxygen propellant in the second stage.

The helium tanks - also known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) - are used in both stages of the Falcon 9 to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure.

""The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed.""

""Each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap.""

""Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.""

SpaceX says investigators identified ""an accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap"" as ""credible causes for the COPV failure.""

SpaceX says they will address the causes of the mishap through both short term and long term ""corrective actions.""

""The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes.""

The short term fixes involve simpler changes to the COPV configuration and modifying the helium loading conditions.

""In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.""

The long term fixes involve changing the COPV hardware itself and will take lobger to implement. They are also likely to be more effective - but only time will tell.

""In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.""

Liftoff of the SpaceX Falcon 9 with the payload of 10 identical next generation IridiumNEXT communications satellites will take place from Space Launch Complex 4E on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California - assuming the required approval is first granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

No Falcon 9 launch will occur until the FAA gives the 'GO.'

Furthermore, in anticipation of announcing the targeted 'Return to Flight' launch date, technicians have already processed the Falcon 9 rocket for the 'Return to Flight' blastoff with the vanguard of a fleet of IridiumNEXT mobile voice and data relay satellites for Iridium Communications - as I reported last week in my story here - and subsequently tweeted by Iridium CEO Matt Desch saying ""Nice recap.""

Last week, the first ten IridiumNEXT mobile voice and data relay satellites were fueled, stacked and tucked inside the nose cone of the Falcon 9 rocket designated as SpaceX's 'Return to Flight' launcher in order to enable a blastoff as soon as possible after an approval is received from the FAA.

""Iridium is pleased with SpaceX's announcement on the results of the September 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight on January 8 with the first Iridium NEXT launch"" Iridium Communications said on their website today, Jan. 2."
2432379160,"What should have been a glorious end to SpaceX 's 2016 ended up in a blaze when, on 1st September, its Falcon 9 exploded even before it could get off the ground, taking Facebook's first satellite down with it. Now four months later, SpaceX is closing the books on its joint investigation with government agencies and industry experts. Having traced down the cause of that failed attempt, SpaceX will once again try its luck on 8th January in an attempt to start the year right.

The investigation, which involved not just SpaceX but also an alphabet soup of government agencies such as FAA, USAF, NTSB, and, of course, NASA, concluded that the accident was, indeed, caused by a rare but obviously fatal interplay of helium, liquid oxygen, aluminum, and carbon materials. Cold helium is used to main the pressure in the liquid oxygen tanks and this helium is stored in containers with aluminum inner liners and carbon overwraps.

At launch, helium is heated and released to maintain pressure in the tanks, but, in this case, the helium may have actually been colder than the oxygen, causing the oxygen to solidify in gaps between the aluminum liner and carbon overwrap. This created a volatile chemical soup that would have been easily excited by even the smallest friction, like movement from buckles supporting the liners. Such may have been the case with the ill-fated Falcon 9 launch in September.

With the case practically closed, SpaceX has implemented measures to prevent another ""rare"" accident, and just in time, too. Iridium Communications, SpaceX's next customer, is probably growing impatient. The mission, which should have launched in mid-December, would replace some of the company's aging satellites. For the sake of safety and completeness, SpaceX pushed the launch date back to early January. Now it seems confident enough that it won't with pie in its face a second time in six months."
2432386100,"A former space shuttle orbital maneuvering system engine has been delivered to Germany for attachment to the European-built service module destined to steer NASA's next Orion spacecraft on a course around the moon on an uncrewed test flight in late 2018.

The engine was refurbished and reassembled at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, then shipped to Johnson Space Center in Houston for shake testing and returned to White Sands for leak tests, according to a European Space Agency blog post.

It flew from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Frankfurt last month, and then continued its journey by truck to Airbus Defense and Space's spacecraft assembly facility in Bremen, Germany, ESA said.

ESA is providing the service modules for at least the next two Orion missions - an unpiloted shakedown cruise in lunar orbit scheduled to lift off in November 2018, and the first Orion flight with astronauts on-board in the early 2020s.

European governments agreed to pay for the service module for the 2018 flight, named Exploration Mission-1, at a meeting of government ministers in December 2012. ESA member states last month committed funding for a second service module for Exploration Mission-2, which will carry up to four astronauts farther than the moon's orbit as soon as 2021.

Airbus Defense and Space is in charge of building the service modules at its Bremen plant. Lockheed Martin is prime contractor for the Orion crew module, which will house the astronauts, their living quarters and the cockpit.

The service modules provide propulsion, propellants, electricity, water, oxygen, nitrogen and thermal control for the Orion spacecraft.

The service module has 33 engines and thrusters to control the Orion capsule's orientation and adjust its trajectory after launch. The main engine for EM-1 is a refurbished Orbital Maneuvering System engine that flew on 19 space shuttle missions.

The OMS engines were mounted on pods on each side of the shuttle's vertical tail, used to change the craft's orbit and begin the spaceship's trip back to Earth with a de-orbit burn.

The engines burn hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants, and were each rated for 100 missions, rated for multiple restarts on each flight.

Aerojet Rocketdyne built the OMS engines, which provide around 6,000 pounds of thrust in vacuum.

The OMS engine slated to launch on EM-1 flew on the shuttle Challenger, Discovery and Atlantis in its career. Its first launch was on the STS-41G mission in October 1984, and its last shuttle mission on STS-112 in October 2002, according to Rachel Kraft, a NASA spokesperson.

The EM-1 mission will last more than three weeks, sending the Orion spacecraft into a high-altitude retrograde orbit around the moon before heading back to Earth for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.

The European-built service module is in the ""critical path"" for EM-1's to remain on track for its launch readiness window, which runs from September through November of 2018. The service module is due for delivery to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida in April - after engineers in Germany add the OMS engine and propellant tanks to the already-finished primary structure.

An on-time delivery of the service module is critical to maintain EM-1's target launch date, unless engineers find a way to make up time once the power and propulsion segment is in the United States.

At KSC, ground crews will connect the service module with the Orion crew module, then ship the spacecraft to NASA's Plum Brook Station in Ohio by the end of 2017 to subject it to the extreme temperatures and vacuum conditions it will encounter in space.

The craft will return to KSC in early 2018 for final assembly steps, including the spacecraft's fueling and the addition of the Orion launch abort system before the stack is mounted on top of NASA's Space Launch System inside the Vehicle Assembly Building for rollout to launch pad 39B.

The agreement last month for ESA to supply a second service module came after European governments extended their support of the International Space Station through 2024. ESA is providing the two service modules for EM-1 and EM-2 as part of a barter agreement to pay NASA for its share of the space station's operating costs.

""We are excited to be a part of this historic mission and appreciate NASA's trust in us to help extend humanity's exploration farther afield into our solar system,"" said David Parker, ESA's director of human spaceflight, after the ministerial meeting in Switzerland last month."
2432414782,"Elon Musk's SpaceX said Monday that it has discovered the cause of a September rocket explosion and plans to return to flight as soon as Sunday.

The conclusions of the company's investigation have yet to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, and the agency has yet to provide it a license to launch. But SpaceX's statement signals it is confident that federal agencies will approve its remedies for the problem and that it will soon get the green light.

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket exploded while being fueled on a launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ahead of an engine test firing on Sept. 1. No one was on board the rocket, and there were no injuries. But the blast touched off a massive fireball and caused extensive damage, including the loss of a commercial satellite.

In its statement, SpaceX said it traced the cause to a pressure vessel in the second-stage liquid-oxygen tank. The tank buckled, the company said, and supercooled liquid oxygen pooled in the lining. The fuel was ignited by breaking fibers or friction.

The company said that in the short term, it plans to change the way it loads fuel. Eventually, it plans to change the design of the pressure vessels to prevent buckling.

SpaceX led the investigation, which was overseen by the FAA, the Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Shortly after the explosion, Musk said it was ""turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have had in 14 years"" and asked the public for help. Over the past four months, the investigation took several bizarre twists and turns. Musk said there was a mysterious ""bang sound"" that may have come from ""the rocket or something else"" seconds before the explosion. And at one point, SpaceX officials asked for access to the roof of a nearby facility used by its rival United Launch Alliance, implying sabotage.

The explosion was a major setback for SpaceX, which has a significant backlog of commercial satellite launches. The company is also under contract to fly cargo and, eventually, astronauts to the International Space Station. But the accident - the company's second failure in less than two years - touched off concerns about its ability to fly safely and reliably.

In June 2015, a Falcon 9 flying cargo to the station blew up shortly after liftoff, destroying $118 million worth of equipment and experiments.

If all goes according to plan, SpaceX plans to launch communications satellites for Iridium, a McLean, Va.-based company, on Sunday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

In an interview in November, Matt Desch, Iridium's chief executive, said he was not worried about entrusting its $3 billion worth of satellites to Musk.

""We've been privy to the thinking and the analysis and the data involved at a very deep level,"" Desch said. ""So, yes, we know why he is saying what's he's saying and concur that they have found the issue. We're encouraged, too, that it was procedural. ... We are back on the path for a first launch and, yes, I feel very confident that the issue that was found won't be repeated for our launch.""

Still, he said on Twitter that the company would wait to load the satellites onto the rocket until after the prelaunch engine test."

2432512196,"WHAT DOES 2017 hold for the world of tech and media? With so much changing at the end of 2016, it's hard to be sure. Very hard. But we have a few guesses.

Here you'll find WIRED's predictions for the coming year, and they come with one big wild card: Donald Trump. When the new administration takes office at the end of January, it will alter the course of so many things in this country of ours-not to mention the rest of the world-and alter them in ways we can't necessarily predict. Tech is no exception.

A Thousand Tech IPOs Will Bloom

2016 was a dismal year for IPOs-the slowest IPO market we've had since the recession. But that's likely to change in 2017.

Snap (formerly Snapchat) will be the first big name going public after the new year. The company has already filed paperwork for an IPO that could value it between $25 and $35 billion. That would be the third most valuable market tech company debut of all time, behind Facebook and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. If it does reach those heights, others are likely to follow, including streaming music company Spotify, cloud storage vendor Dropbox, and meal-kit maker Blue Apron.

We might even see debuts from the ride-sharing company Uber and the super-secretive big data outfit Palantir. The environment must be right, but at the moment, things are looking good. Of the 20 tech and communications companies that went public in the second half of the year, each climbed more than 25 percent from their debuts.

What does a Trump presidency mean for IPOs? Trump has said he plans to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent-good news for companies that may have calculated their valuations on the higher rate. Either way, tech companies likely won't view a Trump presidency as a deterrent. In fact, they may be spurred to go public sooner rather than later-before Trump rolls out policies they haven't foreseen. -Davey Alba

The Internet of Things Will Die

Last September, some malware took control of millions of internet-connected devices, including security cameras and DVRs, and launched an attack that took down the website of security journalist Brian Krebs. It was one of the largest ever attacks of this type. The next month, the same piece of malware rendered large swaths of the internet inaccessible to many people.

The incidents capped off two years of bad news for the ""Internet of Things,"" including bricked devices, irritating outages, bankrupt startups, an international emissions testing scandal, and a viral story about a Brit who spent 11 hours trying make tea with a needlessly high-tech kettle. A Twitter account called Internet of Shit started documenting this market's silliest gadgets, funniest error messages, and most depressing possibilities. It now has over 100,000 followers.

The Internet of Things was a made-up term to begin with. And now this bit of marketing nonsense carries a sheen of ineptitude, danger, and other shit. The upshot: the term will die in 2017, kinda like Big Data before it.

The Internet of Things-or whatever you want to call it-has the potential to save precious resources, spot and fight pollution, and help people lead healthier, safer lives. But adding internet remote control to every single product on the market won't necessarily help us get there. What we need are thoughtful, affordable, durable devices that actually, y'know, make our lives better. A new name, and a renewed sense of purpose, could be just what the Internet of Things needs. -Klint Finley

Real Internet TV Will Wait in the Wings

What we all want is television that lets us watch any show at any time from any device, all at a reasonable price. But that's not quite a reality. And in 2017, it will remain not quite a reality.

Yes, YouTube is putting together a live TV package set to launch in early in the year. Hulu is doing the same. Amazon is poised to enter the fray. And the services will join existing options like AT&T's DirecTV Now, which offers 60 channels for $35 a month or up to 120 channels for $70, plus premium channels HBO and Cinemax for an extra $5 a month.

Sure, the FCC has proposed new rules that would require cable and satellite TV companies to distribute their content through free apps-without the dreaded cable box. And that could push us towards even closer to the nirvana of Internet TV. But there are so many caveats hanging over this market.

Trump's FCC will likely kill those proposed rules, siding with the cable incumbents who want to keep you tethered to your cable box. And his FCC is unlikely to curb ""zero-rating,"" which AT&T is already using to favor its own content on DirecTV Now over the content from rivals. This dynamic may only become more problematic if AT&T is allowed to acquire Time Warner, and the Trump administration will surely allow it. Meanwhile, those live internet TV services have so many holes in them-holes typically involving live sports. Without live sports, you're still tied to cable.

This year, we may see Comcast introduce its own live internet TV service-but this will come with many of the same caveats as DirecTV Now. Internet TV run by the cable companies isn't internet TV. -Davey Alba

'Uber For X' Will Be X-ed Out

In 2015, the on-demand ride companies Sidecar, Shuddle and Karhoo shuttered. Food delivery apps Spoonrocket and Kitchensurfing sunset their services. Washio, which promised push-button laundry, closed down too. Instacart is cutting courier wages, and Postmates doesn't expect to profit until 2018.

Sure, Uber is still going strong. And Airbnb is too. But ""Uber for X""? It will die in 2017.

Consider the numbers. From nearly $9 billion invested in on-demand companies in the third quarter of 2015-the peak for the on-demand economy-there was a sharp pullback in VC funding shortly thereafter, according to industry research firm CB Insights. And the bigwigs in on-demand-Uber, Chinese ridesharing service Didi, and Airbnb-were getting the lion's share of the investments. In 2016, excluding those companies, funding to on-demand startups fell by almost 50 percent.

The field was too crowded with too many competitors. This type of business has razor-thin margins, and running these operations is enormously complicated. They juggle not just consumers but contract workers, all while competing with players with already enormous scale, like Uber and Amazon. In hindsight, Uber for X never stood a chance. -Davey Alba

Trump's America Will Bring Blogging Back

On December 11, 2016, government strategist Eric Garland had some thoughts about how Russia influenced the US election. So he unloaded those thoughts on Twitter-where else?-and called them a THREAD.

Garland, in language at times lyrical and soaring, laid out what he called a game theory analysis of the long con Russia pulled on America with the surprising endgame of electing Donald Trump president. It's a conspiracy theory. But for many, the most controversial thing about this conspiracy theory is that Garland unloaded it on Twitter, requiring his readers to wait and read-and wait and read. (The Stranger helpfully compiled them into a single-page story you can read here if so inclined.)

When 2016 kicked off, this would have been called a tweet storm. The hip nomenclature as the year ends is ""thread""-as Garland showed-but the idea is the same whether the tweets are numbered or merely threaded. And they are happening more and more in the days since November 9. That's because liberals on the internet have a lot of thoughts. Not all of them are as nuanced and out-there as Garlands, but on topics ranging from race to the white middle class to Hillary Clinton's campaign failures, to media bias, to Trump's foreign policy, people are THREADING.

In response, a joke has emerged: uh, guys, remember blogging? It was sort of this same exact thing where you get to speak what's on your mind, but you did it all in one go, without frantic typo-ed tweets unrolling piecemeal over the course of an hour and keeping we poor Twitter followers sitting at our desks waiting for the thrilling conclusion?

Like all the best jokes, it's brilliant because it's true. We're entering a period of tumult and unrest in America and along with it will come lots of thoughts and takes and threads and storms. The upcoming culture clash will make the George W. Bush years look quaint, and those marked the heyday of the blogging era. In 2017, mediums like Medium and Tumblr, which easily let people publish whatever they want, will flourish. In Trump's America, the blog will make a comeback. If only it could bring Google Reader with it. -Emily Dreyfuss

Online Headlines Will Get True Again
As we grapple with the complex causality of disinformation and fake news proliferating through the media landscape, one problem is obvious: people only read headlines. Researchers at Columbia University found that almost 60 percent of stories shared on social media have never been clicked. This is partly the result of the sheer glut of available ""content."" People simply can't read all the journalism out there. And with news delivery services like Twitter and Facebook, which show only a headline and a short description, scrolling story after story in front of frantic, dry eyes, people feel an impossible pressure to read everything. The solution: read every headline and move one.

Others, like ""Saved You a Click"" creator, Jake Beckman, blame this phenomenon on clickbait culture, which in the late aughts tricked readers into clicking on stories that didn't actually deliver on the promise in the headline. Readers rebelled against the deceit and stopped clicking altogether. They judged the story by the headline alone and moved along. Aha! Can't trick readers! But in fact, the logical evolution of clickbait culture was fake news, which understood that readers were not going to bother to read past the first few bricks of the journalistic pyramid, but would rather assess the very top and move on.

In the wake of the 2016 election, which was so influenced by the fabrications peddled in these headlines, journalists, politicians, and technologists are struggling to figure out how to fight fake fire with real water. One very simple thing they can do is write descriptive headlines that are clear and hard to misunderstand. That will be antithetical to the brilliance of clickbait, which leaves readers wondering more. But that model was a failure. It hasn't saved digital journalism from the financial implosion of advertising dollars in the Facebook-as-News era, nor has it on the aggregate encouraged deeper reading. Responsible news outlets trying to figure out how to convey facts will streamline their stories, pack the opening paragraphs with objective reporting, and, ultimately, they will need to abandon clever headlines in favor of clear ones-if they're serious about being understood. -Emily Dreyfuss

Tech Will Get In Bed With Trump

The tech industry didn't always see eye-to-eye with the Obama administration on surveillance and encryption, but that didn't stop the industry from developing a remarkably close relationship with the White House during the Obama years. White House staffers like former press secretary Jay Carney and former senior advisor David Plouffe landed high-profile jobs at tech companies like Amazon and Uber, while former Google employees, such as corporate attorney turned patent office director Michelle Lee, found jobs in the federal government. According to information analyzed by The Intercept, Google's lobbyists met with the White House employees 427 times in between January 2009 and October 2015.

But the election of Donald Trump has called the future of tech's relationship to government into question. Trump's campaign promoted a relentlessly regressive social agenda that stoked racial tensions, especially on the topic of immigration. The tech industry, meanwhile, has lobbied aggressively for immigration reform, and tries to project a progressive image when it comes to topics like gay marriage (which Trump's running mate Mike Pence has a long history of opposing). Few in the tech industry publicly supported Trump, while many-including Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt-openly backed Hillary Clinton.

But don't expect any of that to stop Silicon Valley from cozying up to Trump. Google is already hiring more conservative lobbyists, Reuters reports. It has long employed former Republican congresswoman Susan Molinari. And, of course, several tech leaders-including Schmidt, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg-agreed to meet with Trump in December.

Not everyone in the Valley is trying to suck up to the president-elect. Investor Chris Sacca criticized those who met with Trump, telling Recode they were ""being used to legitimize a fascist."" But Trump's advisory team already includes Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz, and of course PayPal founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, one of the few Valley figures who openly backed Trump before the election.

A few companies have pledged not to help Trump with one of his most frightening campaign promises: building a registry of Muslims. But Silicon Valley's main interest, ultimately, is business. That's something they have in common with Trump. The tech industry might not enjoy the level of access it had to the Obama administration. But if you're looking for someone to stand up to Trump, it's time to look elsewhere. -Klint Finley"

2432573801,"FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, one of the things that that source also told CNN is saying that these digital fingerprints basically mean that the intelligence services were able to follow all of this back, trace all of this back to a keyboard using the Cyrillic language, which is, of course, the language used in the Russian alphabet and/or in the Russian language, and therefore, making the conclusion that the Russian government was involved.

[05:00:23] Now, we put this all to one of Russia's top cyber security and warfare experts and he says, look, it might very well be the case that Russians were involved, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this was the Russian military or Russian government. It could be agencies contracted by government here or could have been people acting on their own.

However, now you have the case that a prominent member of Donald Trump's transition team, former CIA Director James Woolsey has come out and said, yes, he also believes the Russians were behind this. However, unclear to what extent the government was involved and whether or not others may have been involved as well.

Let's listen in to what he had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: It looks from all the indications that we read about from NSA and CIA and so forth as if the Russians were there and perhaps even principally there. It doesn't mean that there isn't somebody else in there. Donald Trump is an expert of this kind of weaving around and attracting everybody's attention. It's exactly what he did during the campaign.

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Are you saying he is playing us?

WOOLSEY: There is a possibility that he is --

SCIUTTO: But is that something the president-elect should be doing on the serious issue of national security?

WOOLSEY: Why not? He is not interfering with anything. He's not talking about anything classified.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

PLEITGEN: So, James Woolsey there saying it looks as though Russians were there and perhaps even principally there. I think that language shows just how murky the waters are when it comes to cyber hacking, when it comes to cyber security, also, of course, there. And the Russians for their part, continuing their line saying that there is absolutely no evidence linking them to all this, calling the allegations absurd. Of course, as you can imagine, John, all of this also playing very, very big, especially in Russia's state-owned media -- John.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Interesting to hear James Woolsey comes out and says that he thinks that Russians were involved, even add to the list that includes the White House, intelligence services, Republicans on both sides of the aisle in Congress. Interesting to see.

Fred Pleitgen in Moscow, thanks so much.

Members of President-elect Trump's transition team are meeting this week to work on executive actions and orders that could be signed just hours after inauguration.

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: New questions this morning about Donald Trump's potential conflicts of interest. In a speech on New Year's Eve at his Mar-a-Lago, Trump thanked one family in particular for attending.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: Hussain and the whole family from -- are the most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight. And they're seeing it and they're loving it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Hussain and his family from Dubai, an apparent reference to his billionaire business partner in Dubai, Hussain Sajwani. Sajwani's company is called DAMAC Properties. It built the Trump International Golf Course Dubai. The two are currently working on a second course designed by Tiger Woods. That's set to open in 2018.

Trump and Sajwani's relationship begun in 2005 with plans to build the tower in Dubai. That idea was scrapped during the global financial crisis. The Trump team says the two did not talk business. Trump himself said over the weekend, the potential conflict is not a big deal. We could get more details on how Trump will separate himself from his business holdings on January 11th. That is the new date for his rescheduled news conference according to advisor Kellyanne Conway.

BERMAN: All right. A new Congress is sworn in today. ROMANS: A Republican Congress.

BERMAN: Here to discuss it all with us, Ellis Henican, a political analyst, bestselling author.

Ellis, so nice to see you.

ROMANS: Hi, good morning. Happy New Year.

ELLIS HENICAN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning. Nice to see you guys together.

ROAMNS: I know, I know, isn't it?

BERMAN: Our lawyer worked things out. We agreed to be here for two hours every morning.

(CROSSTALK)

HENICAN: They should turn you into a team.

BERMAN: If we don't look each other in the eye, it's all OK.

Ellis, let me ask you this -- we have the Congress gaveling in a session at noon today. What do they do the evening before they come in? They strip the independent ethics panel of all of its power, independent no more.

You can tell this is not the message that Republican leaders wanted because House Speaker Paul Ryan actually argued against it.

HENICAN: You know, I come from Louisiana. So, I know something about swamps. The alligators are dancing right now.

I mean, this is exactly the opposite of what we heard through the campaign would happen in this new Trump era, right? That all is inside dealing, all these cozy relationships were going to end.

And I got to tell you, I think it is a huge step backwards. The system as it stood is not perfect. But let me tell you -- it has brought a lot of sunshine into a situation that desperately needed it.

If you believe the ethics in Congress are too high, you're going to like this.

ROMANS: So, what about the timing of this? I mean, do you think the news flow, by the way, is unbelievable? Do you think that they misjudged the public interests in the fact that they're doing this?

HENICAN: I think they assume that their supporters don't really care that much. I think they think this is insidy stuff. It is people like you guys who are concerned about it and most Americans don't care.

BERMAN: To be clear, you know, we say Trump, you know, Trump did campaign on draining the swamp. This isn't the incoming White House. This isn't his team. This is Congress. Republicans in Congress.

Theoretically, President-elect Trump could come out and say today this is a bad idea. He doesn't think Republicans in the House should do it. It would be interesting to hear this from. You know, he's called for term limits. I mean, he's spoken out against congressional privileges before.

HENICAN: That's right. Although I don't think that the incoming President Trump in his own administration as it arrives has taken an especially hard line either. So, I mean, I kind of have the sense the activities in Congress are not that different from the tone that has been set from the incoming administration. But you know what? Maybe he'll surprise us today. I think it will be very interesting.

ROMANS: Let's talk about this tweet on North Korea. I mean, we are talking about some very serious saber-rattling statements from the North Korean leader. Someone who is know you know -- this is what Trump says, ""North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapons capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen.""

And then he goes on to tweet about China. ""China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in a totally one sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice.""

I just can never -- we've said the word unprecedented so many times. We have a book called ""Unprecedented"", I have never heard someone, a president-elect, using Twitter, social media, to deal with issues like this.

HENICAN: That's true. And you know, it's interesting, to the phrase, ""It won't happen."" Remember how much trouble Barack Obama got in over the red line in Syria.

ROMANS: Right.

HENICAN: Very dangerous for president to lay down very specific claims. It won't happen is -- you know, you kind of have to live up to that once you make those claims. And how are you going to do that? I don't know.

ROMANS: But isn't it exactly what, you know, Kim Jong-un wants? You know, the megalomaniac leader of that country. He wants a direct response from the White House.

HENICAN: It elevates him, doesn't it? It puts him, these two leaders on a mano-a-mano, on a personal debate with each other. I don't see how that helps our position.

BERMAN: So, Ellis, congressional Democrats, Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer has a list of eight of Donald Trump's nominees that they're going to try to delay. They want more information and he says he's going to fight them or at least fight to delay or ask as many questions as possible. How much do you think Democrats really can muck up this process? HENICAN: I think it will slow it down. I mean, the Senate is the place that those require agreement from everybody or stuff slows down. I think it is highly likely the president is going to get most of his nominees through. There may be one or two.

And the ones at risk are truly the ones where there are Republicans who will join the Democratic opposition, especially around the issue of being cozy with Russia. There's clearly an audience in the Republican side.

ROMANS: In terms of Donald Trump and Mar-a-Lago event this weekend, where he was calling out a family of billionaire who he works within Dubai, do we have any sense the conflict of interest questions will go away here? Is it making sense to have a paying audience there and have him there for a president-elect?

HENICAN: Again, unprecedented, I would say. In the realm we have gotten used to there, in the new normal, I don't know that one was especially egregious. But no, I think it points up exactly what you say, that these are unsolved issues and they are not easy to solve. It's very difficult to unwind this stuff, unless you take steps that clearly Trump and his family do not want to, which is to completely divest themselves of this business --

(CROSSTALK)

BERMAN: Well, Kellyanne Conway said maybe we will get a press conference January 11th now.

HENICAN: Oh, yeah?

BERMAN: It was initially slated for December 15th. Now she says it's possible maybe that President-elect Trump will hold a news conference on January 11th.

ROMANS: You heard Trump the other day say, you know, I know things others don't know. I'll reveal it Tuesday or Wednesday.

He talks like that. Donald Trump talks like that. Remember the birther debate in 2011 and 2012? He said, I know -- I know about the birth certificate more than other people and he didn't.

HENICAN: You know, here is the challenge in all this, for I think us and all Americans, is not to get away from our standards in judging these things. It's easy to say, well, you know, this is just Trump. Well, it's Twitter and it's no big deal. And that somehow we need to fold on our own ability to judge kinds of these things.

I think it is crucially important going forward as we approach the inauguration that we all remember what our values, what we stand for, and one of them in this business that we're in is that, you know, facts matter. If you say something, we're going to hold you to it. Let us know that reality. Is that fair?

BERMAN: We'll report what people say. We will check if it is true or not. HENICAN: Yes.

[05:10:00] BERMAN: Ellis, great to have you with us.

HENICAN: Good to be with you.

ROMANS: Nice to see you. Come back in a few minutes.

Thousands of international travelers are delayed for hours at airports across the country on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The problem with a computer outage lasted from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. Eastern, creating this super long lines of inbound international travelers. Customs and Border Patrol officers had to process passengers through so-called alternative procedures, aka, the old fashioned way, as the agency scrambled to get these computer systems back online.

U.S. official tells CNN at this time there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature.

BERMAN: All right. A terrorist on the run. The latest on the manhunt for the gunman who opened fire at a nightclub on New Year's Eve. We'll have new details. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROMANS: Welcome back.

In Turkey, the manhunt intensifying for the Istanbul nightclub attacker. Officials releasing this selfie video of the suspected gunman wanted for the killing, though, he has yet to be publicly identified.

Thirty-nine people were killed in the New Year's Eve massacre, most of them foreigners. ISIS has claimed responsibility. Police have detained eight people in connection with the attack. And fingerprints found at the scene could help identify the shooter.

I want to bring in CNN's Ian Lee. He's following all of these developments for us. He is live in Istanbul for us.

So, we have the selfie video that's been released to Turkish media by the authorities. They say they have a fingerprint. What do we know?

IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, very little except for that right now because Turkey authorities have been fairly tight lipped about this investigation. Really the only thing we heard from the authorities is that they have those fingerprints. They know what he looks like. They say they're going to use that evidence to figure out if he also had any help.

Now, security experts say it is likely he had help in the operation because he was able to flee the scene so easily. Now, ISIS has claimed responsibility. We haven't been able to independently verify that, nor has the terror group released any evidence that confirms they were behind it. But if he was indeed an ISIS operative, there is a chance that he might try to escape into Syria. So, for Turkish officials, it is a bit of a ticking clock. They say, though, they have hundreds of security personnel scouring the country looking for him.

They have these eight people who have been detained. They're interrogating them, too, trying to figure out who he is and where he went and who was possibly supporting him. But Turkey has been battling ISIS militancy here. There's ISIS cells that have been operating.

So, this is a threat that Turkey is used to, but hasn't been able to deal with effectively.

ROMANS: All right. Ian Lee on the manhunt for us this morning. Thank you so much, Ian, in Istanbul.

BERMAN: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced police interrogation overnight in a corruption probe authorized by his own attorney general. This all stems from allegations that he received illegal benefits from businessmen.

He faced three hours of questioning. Authorities are not releasing any details. The prime minister denies wrongdoing and calls the accusations politically motivated.

ROMANS: Republican House leaders are planning to vote on Thursday on a measure that would condemn last week's U.N. resolution against Israel. The U.N. resolution labeled Israeli settlements in the West Bank a flagrant violation of international law, and the Obama administration abstained when it came time to vote. Republican leaders say the Obama White House has lost credibility on Israel and that their bipartisan measure reaffirms the America's longstanding commitment to the Jewish state.

All right. Sixteen minutes past the hour.

Chicago dealing with the highest murder rate in decades. And now, the president-elect weighing in. City officials are responding.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:20:16] BERMAN: Donald Trump, the president-elect, with new sharp criticism of Chicago's mayor over that city's soaring murder rate. There was a 57 percent spike in 2016.

President-elect tweeted, ""Chicago murder rate is record setting, 4,371 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If mayor can't do it, he must ask for federal help.""

Now, it did not take long for Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, to respond.

Let's get the latest from CNN's Rosa Flores.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, John and Christine, the city mayor's office responding to the president-elect's tweet by saying in part, quote, ""We are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.""

Now, let's dive into the details a bit here because in 2016, the city of Chicago saw 762 murders, 3,550 shooting incidents and 4,331 shooting victims. Now most of these killings happened in five districts on the west and south sides of the city. This is according to police, in an area, they say, where 59 gangs are fighting for territory.

Now, if you ask the former police superintendent, he'll say that the Chicago Police Department is in crisis. Here is what he told ""60 Minutes.""

GARRY MCCARTHY, FORMER CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: Offices are under attack. That's how they feel, right? That's how they feel in this environment. And they're not going to put themselves and their families in jeopardy.

FLORES: The Chicago Police Department responding to the former Chicago police superintendent by saying in part the police across the country are more cautious in this climate. They arrested more bad guys, they called them, in 2016 than they did in 2015. But if there were one thing that could change, that could help them do their job better and keep Chicago safer, they say, is tougher laws for repeat gun offenders. That's what they are hoping for in 2017 to make Chicago a little safer -- John and Christine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROMANS: All right, Rosa Flores.

It is so hard to talk about policy in tweets, to be honest, you know? I mean, what if under federal control, what would Trump do? You know, is that education system? Is it Law enforcement? I mean, what would he do? That is what I would be interested to know.

All right. Let's talk about weather here. Twenty-two minutes past the hour.

Violent storm system sweeping across the southern U.S. blamed for now five deaths, at least. Emergency officials say four people were killed in southern Alabama when a tree fell and collapsed on a mobile home during a tornado, a fifth weather-related death is reported in Florida.

In Mississippi, trees ripped from the ground and homes damaged in more than a dozen counties. They may have been hit by tornadoes. Remarkably, no injuries have been reported, but look at all that damage. Some 20,000 customers are without power.

Let's get the latest from meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John and Christine.

What a wild Monday evening across portions of the southeast. And you know, the number there is four fatalities out of these tornadoes. Rather remarkable considering in 2016, we had 17 fatalities as a total. That was the sheer lowest number of fatalities in an entire year. And, of course, we start rapidly across the southeast and across the country with a number of tornadoes in the past 24 hours.

But the line of active weather is falling apart as it migrates off to the east. And I want to show you what we are dealing with the number of tornadoes that we saw on Monday afternoon and Monday evening because about 130 severe storm reports we're seeing across the country, 12 of which related to tornadoes. This accounts for about 1/4 of all tornadoes. You would see the entire month of January, we saw them all, of course, in the first couple of days in 2017.

And the perspective is the storm system pushing to the north and east. The severe element all tapers. A lot of rainfall in store for the Northeast this afternoon and this evening, particularly for the major metro cities toward sunset, just as the storm pushing east. We notice the cold air behind it, it begins to mark its way off to the south as well. Bismarck, minus 1. Temperatures in New York City, as much as 45. Cooling in store for the next couple days -- guys.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BERMAN: All right. Pedram, thanks so much.

A South Carolina judge cleared the way for a convicted church shooter Dylann Roof to represent himself when the sentencing phase of his trial begins tomorrow. The judge ruled Roof is mentally competent to act as his own lawyer. The judge also issuing an order that prevents Roof from physically approaching the jury or any witnesses during the proceeding.

Roof plans to make an opening statement and is refusing to present any kind of psychological defense at sentencing. He was convicted last month of killing nine people at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

The daughter of Carrie Fisher and granddaughter of Debbie Reynolds is speaking publicly for the first time since losing both last week. Actress Billie Lourd posted a picture on Instagram of herself and Fisher and Reynolds who died just one day apart.

[05:25:04] Lourd also posted a message that said in part, ""Receiving all of your prayers is giving me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist. Your love and support means the world to me.""

ROMANS: All right. SpaceX expected to resume rocket launches just five days from now. The company said it will use revised operational practices to launch its Falcon 9 rocket from California on January 9th. SpaceX suspended flights after the September launch test went up in flames back in September during a pre-launch test. They say, a problem with the helium tank caused the blast.

BERMAN: All right. Overnight, the House Republicans voted to take the independence away from an independent ethics panel. So, where is the watchdog here? That's coming up.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROMANS: New overnight: Republican House members ready to do away with their ethics watch dog. Why would they strip away the power of the panel as president-elect Trump gets ready to take office? We have the details.

BERMAN: New, exclusive details linking Russia to the hack of the U.S. election season. As an advisor to Donald Trump says, he sees evidence of Russian involvement, but President-elect Trump still hasn't revealed information he says that gives him pause.

ROMANS: And Trump once again addressing nuclear weapons on Twitter. His direct message for North Korea. We have that in minutes.

Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.

Good morning, John.

BERMAN: Good morning, Christine.

We're just -- where are we? -- 29 minutes after the hour.

What a day. What a message. A new Congress gavels in at noon today, set to effectively neuter the independent ethics office that watches over it. You heard that right, as Republicans usher in a new era of power with control of both Congress and the White House and after President-elect Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp, last night behind closed doors, Republicans voted to end the impendence of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.

"
2432585389,"Mindful that the new year is a time of hope and optimism, I encourage you to take a moment as you begin 2017 to read an important expression of skepticism and caution. Fortune 's Erin Griffith has published a brave and discerning reported essay in the new issue of the magazine titled ""The ugly, unethical underside of Silicon Valley."" In it she describes a ""fake-it-'til-you-make-it"" culture gone too far, an industry whose celebration of rule breakers and its weak relationship with the truth breeds more fraudulent behavior than is generally well understood.

I initially was skeptical of Griffith's skepticism. Every industry has its bad actors; that's what keeps the court system busy. With her acidic prose and unforgiving analysis, Griffith admirably debunks this ""bad apple"" theory. Instead, she argues, too much of Silicon Valley is defined by the actions of a secretive group of entrepreneurs who are emboldened to make wild assertions of future success by investors who have every reason to look the other way.

Griffith isn't arguing that all of Silicon Valley is rotten. Instead, she intelligently asserts that we shouldn't kid ourselves that tech's change-the-world, do-no-evil, self-congratulatory ethos somehow exempts it from the malevolence that lurks elsewhere in the commercial world.

I'm coming up next year on two decades covering Silicon Valley. And I've born witness to some truly incredible people and companies. Yet what resonated for me about Griffith's groundbreaking article is what I've come to recognize as an unhealthy cult of entrepreneurialism. Starting companies absolutely is a productive and noble endeavor. The economy wouldn't function without it. Yet that doesn't make every startup or every entrepreneur a good idea or a noble person. Nor does it mean people who choose a different path--including serving in say, the horror, government or academia--somehow inferior.

The technology industry will do amazing things and achieve thrilling heights in 2017. (In fact, the fun begins this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.) Investors, journalists, regulators, employees, competitors, and partners all need to make sure it gets there ethically and honorably.

Happy New Year to all.

So, enough about what happened last year. Here's what's going down in 2017, along with my takes on what could happen.

Landmark decision on downtown

The Melbourne City Council will decide this month whether to approve an eight-story building with 171 modern apartments on New Haven Avenue, next door to the Henegar Center for Performing Arts.

Everyone involved calls it a potential breakthrough for the economy and culture of downtown. It is exactly the type of ""mixed use"" the city's redevelopment plan has called for, with housing above ground-floor shops and a restaurant, and ""creative class"" people living downtown 24-7.

The city would pay for parking and other improvements for the public around the $24 million project with a $1.85 million loan to developer Sam Zimmerman. New property tax revenue from the project would then pay off the loan.

The ""Highline"" project is now three years in the making. This style of development is way overdue in Brevard.

Corruption case goes to court

Nearly 31/2 years after his arrest on bribery and bid-tampering charges, former Brevard Clerk of Courts Mitch Needelman may finally go to trial along with a lobbyist and contractor.

The trio is charged in an alleged kickback scheme in which a software company agreed to donate tens of thousands of dollars to Needelman's 2012 campaign in exchange for a no-bid, $8.5 million contract to scan old court documents.

A judge in Sanford has kept a pretrial hearing set for Jan. 18.

Brevard taxpayers need to see justice done in this case.

All Aboard Florida on track?

The controversial, privately run Miami-to-Orlando passenger rail service (via Brevard) had until Jan. 1 to sell tax-exempt bonds to investors to meet a deadline set by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The proceeds would fund tracks and construction for the first phase of its high-speed Brightline trains, from Miami to West Palm Beach. A later private bond sale to raise more than $1 billion would fund a second phase, including tracks between Cocoa and Orlando where none exist today.

Although Brevard cities and Port Canaveral see opportunity in the short, quiet trains, politicians in Indian River and Martin counties have tied up the venture in the courts and regulatory system, trying to kill it with delays.

Will government let the market decide the future of rail? We'll know in the next few weeks.

School board software showdown

In December, Brevard Public Schools Superintendent Desmond Blackburn and the board of Canadian software contractor Harris School Systems both seemed prepared to quit a $5.9 million contract for business software that still doesn't work. After two years of free troubleshooting and legal negotiations, an end could come any week now.

Name a stakeholder in this mess - taxpayers, educators, the company, school board members - all would hurt from losing millions on a previous administration's poorly vetted software deal. Not least of whom are school staffers who need 21st-century software to run payroll, purchasing, accounting and contracts for a district serving 74,000 students.

State, county action on lagoon

Joe Negron, the new Florida Senate president from the Treasure Coast, is now pitching a plan for the upcoming legislative session to stop discharges of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee into the southern Indian River Lagoon.

Brevard's legislative delegation has promised to deliver this spring on voters' demands for dredging and funding for the sick estuary.

And Brevard County Commissioners are starting now on a 10-year, $300 million cleanup plan approved by voters in November.

To think that none of this was certain two months ago. Voters made all the difference.

Trump to jolt space, defense

Shortly after his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump will get to work seeking a new NASA administrator. Most analysis I've read says he'll pick someone who will make racing the Chinese and Russians to the moon a more urgent, interim priority over flying to Mars.

What that could mean to NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule - and, in turn, jobs and business on the Space Coast - is anyone's guess. But Brevard's economy can't take another major space program cancellation from a third president in a row.

Slower to arrive in 2017, but just as significant, will be Trump and congressional Republicans' vow to lift the years-old ""sequestration"" spending cap on defense budgets, a byproduct of Washington gridlock. That could reinvigorate sales at defense contractors such as Harris Corp., Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and United Launch Alliance. It also could bring better conditions for Air Force families.

Which is great as long as Trump stays reluctant to deploy our personnel, bombers and gear.

And there's more news, coming fast in 2017:

State and Brevard County leaders will propose new ethics reforms to keep government honest.

State universities and Florida Tech will get serious about reaching America's top tier by targeting dollars at new laboratories and star faculty.

Palm Bay could commit to a $9 million replacement of crumbling Malabar Road while pursuing a settlement with the contractor that built it.

All of these stories are coming fast. All are big decision points that require your watchfulness and leaders' accountability.

Together, let's demand the best for Brevard County in 2017.

2432660617,SpaceX plans to resume flights as early as next week after saying it's found the cause of this worrying explosion https://t.co/gye7zJaNIh https://t.co/AleZ77CfbI
2432699284,"SpaceX believes it has gotten to the core of what caused the Falcon 9 explosion on September 9, 2016 , that sent the rocket and the $200 million Facebook satellite it was carrying up in a fiery blaze. The Hawthorne-based spaceflight company also announced that it will return to launching payloads on January 8.

SpaceX explains in a statement that a pressure vessel containing cold helium ruptured when liquid oxygen (LOX) outside the vessel worked its way in between the aluminum tank and its carbon fiber liner. The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the FAA, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). While SpaceX has previously given hints about the cause of the explosion , this seems to be the final word.

From the statement:

The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.

SpaceX has also announced its next launch date, January 8, the first since the September explosion. A Falcon 9 will carry a satellite built by Iridium Communications into orbit, part of a new 66-satellite constellation program known as Iridium NEXT . SpaceX's return launch will blast off from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E).

SpaceX completed eight successful launches in 2016 before the September Falcon 9 explosion brought their launch operations to a grinding halt. Here's to many more launches in 2017."
2432713390,"Finland is offering free money to some citizens as part of an experiment aimed at cutting government red tape, reducing poverty and boosting employment.

Starting this Monday, the two-year trial will see 2,000 randomly-picked unemployed citizens receive €560 (£477/$587) each month, with no constraints on how to spend it.

The amount, which will be deducted from any benefits the citizens already receive, would keep coming even after citizens find employment.

Olli Kangas from the Finnish government agency KELA, which is responsible for the country's social benefits, said the scheme's idea was to abolish the ""disincentive problem"" among the unemployed.

The hope is that once unemployed people receive a guaranteed income they'll feel incentivised to look for a job and generally to improve their lives. A basic income, according to its advocates, prevents people from falling through the cracks of social security system.

In Finland, as in the U.S., people get welfare benefits according to their incomes.

""It's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave,"" Kangas told The Associated Press. ""Will this lead them to boldly experiment with different kinds of jobs? Or, as some critics claim, make them lazier with the knowledge of getting a basic income without doing anything?""

""It's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave.""

A jobless person may currently refuse a low-income or short-term job in the fear of having his financial benefits reduced drastically under Finland's generous and complex social security system.

The unemployment rate of Finland, a nation of 5.5 million, stood at 8.1% in November with 213,000 people without a job - unchanged from the previous year.

The scheme is part of measures by the centre-right government of Finland's prime minister, Juha Sipila, to tackle unemployment.

Kangas said the basic income experiment may be expanded at a later date to other low-income groups such as freelancers, small-scale entrepreneurs and part-time workers.

Basic income has been a popular source of debate among academics and economics for decades but Finland is the first nation in the European Union to actually implement the idea.

The basic income was popularized by the economist Milton Friedman in the 1960s as a ""negative income tax"" but is picking up steam in several countries - Canada, India and the Netherlands - and in Silicon Valley.

The Dutch city of Utrecht is in the process of a pilot project on basic income, and seven other cities in the country have announced their intention to explore the idea, which has been discussed in the Netherlands since the 1970s.

In November, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk said that he believes the solution to taking care of human workers who are displaced by robots and software is creating a (presumably government-backed) universal basic income for all."
2432736063,Have you ever wondered why we talk about SpaceX so much? They're making real strides to change spaceflight: https://t.co/NE9tEG2OH2
2432738950,"The Trump people are taking over NASA, and it's hard to predict how this will play out for the agency's human spaceflight program. That's in part because the usual rules of partisanship and ideology don't apply in outer space. Above the stratosphere, there's no left and right. (If anything, things are somewhat reversed, because a lot of Republicans support Big Government human spaceflight projects, as we'll discuss in a moment.) Moreover, the president-elect hasn't said much about space, and space wasn't an issue in his campaign, either.

To the extent that Donald Trump has signaled any intentions, it's in the makeup of the ""landing team"" now at NASA to plan the transition. The team has several people who have shown interest in going back to the moon. So, as we've reported, the moon could be very much back in play.

In these waning days of the Obama administration, NASA continues to brand its programs as part of a ""Journey to Mars."" The label is, to some degree, public relations pure and simple. In the near term, NASA's plan is to send astronauts around the moon in a series of missions in the 2020s. Why? Because there's nowhere else to go at the moment given current funding and hardware. Trump's people could say, hold on, let's actually land on the moon. That would require new hardware or international partners and a lot of money. Some moon advocates say there are resources there, such as ice, that could be turned into fuel for a Mars mission.

A couple of weeks ago, Trump spoke with historian Douglas Brinkley, and afterward Brinkley said Trump ""was very interested in a man going to the moon and the moon shot."" That generated some press, because of the Mars vs. moon debate, but most likely Trump was merely thinking about how he could take a page from President John F. Kennedy when he gives his inaugural address. This was about style, not the space program, in other words.

The people who want to go to Mars right away say the moon is a diversion and would result in many decades of delay. They note that the moon and Mars are completely different. Yes, they're both round objects in outer space, but beyond that, they're an apple and an orange. Each presents unique challenges for descent and landing, resource utilization, communications, crew psychology and more.

Yet the moon-Mars question actually may not be the most consequential fork in the road for NASA. If the Trump folks want to be really disruptive, they could veer more dramatically toward commercial contracts and away from traditional contracts. They could favor ""New Space"" vs. ""Old Space,"" to be overly simplistic about it. (Disclosure: Among the most prominent entrepreneurial space companies is Blue Origin, which, like The Washington Post, is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)

The landing team at NASA was recently expanded to include several people associated with commercial space. Among them: Alan Stern, whom readers will recognize as the leader of the New Horizons mission to Pluto. A few years ago, Stern formed a company aspiring to create commercial flights to the moon.

The Trump folks could conceivably take the radical step of killing the SLS rocket -- the Space Launch System, a descendant of the heavy-lift rocket pushed a decade ago by the George W. Bush administration under its Constellation program. Obama officially killed Constellation, but elements survived, protected by several powerful senators. Those include the SLS and Orion, a crew capsule now in its second decade of development, with a price tag north of $10 billion. The idea is, the SLS will launch Orion into outer space, and Orion will orbit the moon, and the astronauts will return to Earth, and then they'll do that a bunch more times.

It's hard to kill big space programs that cost a lot of money. Think: stakeholders. Think: too big to fail.

But there's this other avenue of attack in space, which is to let the private companies design, build and own the hardware and then for the government to pay those companies for access to space. This is already happening with cargo going to the International Space Station, and in the next few years, U.S. astronauts will fly ""commercial"" into orbit. SpaceX is already building a huge rocket called the Falcon Heavy. The George W. Bush administration pushed commercial space, which helped SpaceX get going, and then Obama doubled down on it. So this is a bipartisan concept, to the extent that anything in Washington is bipartisan.

The problem is that it won't make some of the big aerospace contractors happy. And that means it won't make some powerful lawmakers happy."
2432756058,"SpaceX is ready to resume launching again, a little more than four months following the September 1 explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket, its payload, and the launch pad it was sitting on. The company identified the cause of the explosion , has a short-term fix in place, and is targeting January 8 for its return to flight.

Although SpaceX originally planned to be back in action in November , the failure turned out to be the most complex the company has ever faced, according to CEO Elon Musk.

A statement from SpaceX detailed the findings of the investigation that followed the explosion. Kenneth Change at The New York Times provides a nice breakdown of what happened .

After analyzing massive amounts of data, the investigation panel (which included folks from SpaceX, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Air Force) concluded that the explosion originated with the helium tanks that sit inside the oxygen tanks on the rocket's second stage. The helium helps to keep the oxygen under pressure while the engine burns.

The helium tanks are made of two layers: a carbon composite wrapper and an aluminum liner. As these layers came into contact with the Falcon 9's super-cooled oxygen and helium during the fueling process, the rapid temperature change may have caused the two layers to shrink at different rates, causing buckling and opening gaps for the surrounding oxygen to flow in. With oxygen trapped in between the flammable layers, just a little bit of friction is all that would be needed to start an inferno. Just 0.093 seconds after anomalies appeared in SpaceX's data, the entire rocket was engulfed in flames.

To correct the problem, SpaceX will use warmer helium and return the system to a previous configuration. Over the long-term, some design changes to the helium tanks will hopefully prevent buckling.

If all goes according to plan-which is never guaranteed in rocketry-the Falcon 9 will lift off again on Sunday carrying 10 Iridium telephone relay satellites into orbit.

Seeing as SpaceX's launch pad at Cape Canaveral was destroyed in September, Sunday's launch will take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. But later in January, the company aims to launch another communications satellite from the historic Launch Complex 39A-the launch pad from which most of the Apollo and many space shuttle missions blasted off. The company hopes to resume carrying supplies to the International Space Station later this month.

SpaceX plans to resume Falcon 9 launches on Sunday after completing its investigation into a September pad explosion. The company announced Monday that its study of the explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 during preparations for a static-fire test Sept. 1 found buckles in the aluminum liners of composite overwrapped pressure vessels that store helium in the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket's upper stage. Liquid oxygen then pooled in the gaps between the liner and the carbon overwrap, causing the tanks to fail. The company said it's mitigating the problem in the near term by using warmer helium, and in the long term will redesign the pressure vessels. SpaceX said it plans to resume launches of the Falcon 9 with a Sunday launch of 10 Iridium Next satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, provided the FAA concurs with the investigation's outcome and issues a launch license.

Teams competing for the Google Lunar X Prize will have to wait until later this month to find out if they'll be able to continue in the competition. The deadline for the X Prize Foundation to verify launch contracts, a step required for teams to continue in the race to the moon, was Saturday . However, the foundation isn't expected to announce until later in the month which teams made the cut beyond the five who already have verified contracts. Two of the 16 teams, Astrobotic and Team PuliSpace, have said they will not be continuing in the competition since they were not planning to get launch contracts by the deadline. The fate of the remaining teams, including one, PT Scientists, who announced a contract in November, remains unclear. [SpaceNews]

2432818653,"SpaceX is ready to return to space later in January, the company announced yesterday. In September, one of the company's Falcon 9 rockets exploded on the launch pad, and it halted launches while the cause of that explosion was investigation.

According to SpaceX, the investigation it undertook along with Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the most likely cause of the explosion was a failure of a pressure vessel within the rocket's liquid oxygen tank. Having identified this, the company said in a statement that it's begun a series of actions to ""address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes."" In the short term, this involves making changes to the pressure vessel configurations, but in the long term will involve design changes to the Falcon 9.

With the potential issue with the rocket identified, SpaceX plans to launch on Jan. 8 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex. The payload for the launch will be satellites for the Iridium NEXT constellation, which provides broadband and mobile services for Iridium's customers.

Once the Falcon 9 successfully launches in January, the company intends to resume its regularly scheduled launches."
2432825049,"@Steve_Hayes crickets from @SpaceX. I guess we have defined the limits of my ""celebrity""."
2432827435,SpaceX rockets were grounded for four months pending an investigation into a September launch pad explosion. The Verge's Loren Grush reports.
2432854067,"The satellite industry is developing at a rapid rate. New applications are emerging all the time. Due to the fact that satellite can be used for so many applications, such as broadcasting, mapping, meteorology, Earth observation and much more, the rapid increase in use over recent years has resulted in a serious shortage of bandwidth availability in the lower frequency bands.

The industry has been talking about this congestion for quite some time now. We have seen the industry move into new bands, from C to Ku and from Ku to Ka. The move to Ka band is expected to relieve the pressure on available bandwidth as there will be much more available. However, with demand growing for higher throughput, and the advent of Non-Geostationary Orbit (NGSO) constellations, the industry is considering the future. Now, the time has come to assess the potential that lies in other bands that can help support the growing demand for applications that require high throughput today and in the future.

So, we move up the satellite spectrum to Q/V band. This is the next frontier in terms of satellite frequency bands and can open up new possibilities for the fast deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.

What is Q/V Band?

The Q/V bands lie between 33-75 GHz, within the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) area of the radio spectrum. These frequencies are used mainly for satellite communications, remote sensing, terrestrial microwave communications and for radio astronomy studies.

It is hoped that EHFs will enhance the performance of the next generation of High Throughput Satellite (HTS) programs by enabling the offload of satellite links between a satellite and its hubs from the Ka band to the Q/V bands. This would make more bandwidth available for users in Ka-band and would also reduce the number of hubs required. This, in turn, will help drive down cost per bit.

Written here, it sounds simple, but the EHF bands are prone to signal propagation, which is the effect that the different regions of the atmosphere have on a satellite signal. At millimeter waves, which travel solely by line-of-sight, the effects of this propagation can be significant. Therefore, mitigation techniques, such as ACM, will be necessary to reduce this degradation. This, however, would need to be achieved in a cost-effective way.

""Due to the higher atmospheric and rain attenuation in these bands, they will initially be applied for high-bandwidth gateway feeder links using larger Earth stations to [Geostationary Earth Orbit] GEO systems"" explains Mark Spiwak, president at Boeing Satellite Systems International. ""But the high bandwidth available in Q/V-band systems also makes them attractive for user and gateway links for Middle-Earth Orbit (MEO) or Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) systems, since these orbits have lower path losses.""

If the Q/V bands are exploited, they could open up the potential for a wide range of new products and services for both military and commercial applications. However, what kind of appetite is there for a move into these new bands and how ready is the satellite industry to make the move? As with Ka-band, there will be both technical and regulatory challenges, so is this a realistic possibility for the industry?

Initiatives are already underway to test transmissions in the Q/V bands. In March this year, Eutelsat became one of the first commercial operators to test Q/V-band communications on its Eutelsat 65 West A satellite. ""Our objective is to gain advanced insight into enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of future high throughput satellites,"" says Yohann Leroy, Eutelsat CTO.

Eutelsat 65 West A Arianespace

In partnership with, Space Systems Loral (SSL), Eutelsat confirmed that it had successfully carried out transmissions in EHF using an experimental payload. This payload was included to analyze the potential of the Q/V band at 40-50 GHz and to monitor whether this could be an enabler for Terabit satellite broadband programs.

""We believe that Q and V bands will shape the blueprint of future broadband communications systems as these bands will significantly enhance the performance of the next generation of high throughput satellite programs,"" continues Leroy.

AlphaSat and Aldo Paraboni

The launch of Alphasat in July 2013 was a significant step forward in the development of the use of the Q/V bands by the satellite industry. The largest telecommunications satellite ever built, Alphasat hosted a payload built by Thales Alenia Space, for the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Called Aldo Paraboni, after the late Italian scientist that inspired it, the technology demonstration payload is the first to explore the Q/V bands at 38 and 48 GHz.

The payload is testing the performance of the broadband data traffic between stations in Q/V bands to assess the performance under the atmospheric conditions that can affect signals so negatively.

The job has now begun for scientists at ASI, to analyze the two sets of data from the two signals transmitted from the payload across Europe. The scientists are comparing their performances to determine exactly how they are affected by weather. The data will be used to model future broadband communications from geostationary satellites. It is hoped that the project will result in more available bandwidth and the possibility of smaller user terminals as further research is expected to eradicate the need for oversized links to compensate for signal degradation.

""Building a solid network of back-up terrestrial gateways is a condition to overcome Q and V band's sensitivity to weather conditions,"" says Leroy. ""Solutions will need to be developed to switch from one gateway to another in less than 30 seconds and integrate weather forecast intelligence into the network.""

The research taking place is very encouraging for future telecommunications deployments. However, where does the wider satellite industry stand on this? As we are waiting to see how the Ka-band will shake out, is this really a priority at this point in time and something that the industry at large should be considering?

AlphaSat Aldo Paraboni payload. Thales Alenia Space and ESA

Spiwak believes that there is interest and that things could move into the Q/V-band area sooner rather than later. ""There is certainly increasing interest among HTS operators,"" he explains. ""Moving gateway antennas to these bands frees up Ku-band and Ka-band spectrum for increased user capacity, allowing greater access to connectivity for these users.""

Satellite operator interest in new bands must be expected, as they must look so far ahead. The satellite business, for operators especially, is a long term one, and so future requirements need to be addressed far in advance.

However, for broadband communications provider Advantech Wireless, the move to Q/V band is only marginally on the radar. ""We see them being used potentially as 'feeder' links to high throughput satellites,"" says Steve Richeson, senior vice president of global sales and business development at Advantech Wireless. ""The wide bandwidth available can provide efficiency in network architectures requiring a single hub station for an uplink to multiple independent spot beams. We are working with customers to keep an eye on the requirements for these bands. It is early days in the commercial deployment of these systems and there is no practical demand or solution today.""

Hurdles to Clear: Regulation

The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recently passed its Spectrum Frontiers proposal, which will expedite the fast track of 5G services, the first of which could be seen as early as next year. The proposal stresses that the FCC will promote sharing schemes to ensure that different users are able to share spectrum. The FCC's factsheet states: ""It would also create a path for continued and expanded satellite operations in the 28 GHz, 37 GHz, and 39 GHz bands. It would adopt several mechanisms to provide flexibility to satellite operators and predictability to terrestrial operators.""

However, there is unease within the satellite industry, and great concern that satellite may not be given the best deal in the Q/V bands. After the fight for C-band at the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2015 (WRC-15), there is concern that the industry may have to fight yet again.

There is unease within the satellite industry, and great concern that satellite may not be given the best deal in the Q/V bands.

The FCC's new rules provide access to 5G carriers in the satellite downlink band and that this will affect the placement of V-band gateways. ""There are also proposed rules that may provide 5G carriers with access to the satellite uplink bands,"" explains Spiwak. ""Internationally, studies are underway at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to develop the process and rules to enable the successful coordination of the Q/V band between satellites and other allocated services.""

There is much potential for a clash of horns. The level of interest in the Q/V bands from some HTS operators is significant. Along with Boeing and Eutelsat, other operators such as Viasat, Inmarsat, OneWeb, O3b and Iridium are also taking great interest in and working on initiatives in EHF, and there is fear that access to the spectrum could be under threat if 5G deployment is favored over the needs of the satellite industry.

""In particular, the satellite industry is looking for an endorsement of the governments in 2019 during WRC-19 confirming the attractiveness for the satellite industry, to integrate these bands, through clear regulatory provisions, in the deployment of future satellite broadband solutions,"" says Wladimir Boquet, director of spectrum management policy at Eutelsat.

It is important that dialogue is encouraged across all industries and agencies concerned.

""Boeing has been working closely with the FCC, the ITU, the Satellite Industry Association (SIA) and terrestrial operators to advocate the needs of satellite systems,"" says Spiwak. ""We are also working directly with terrestrial operators to understand the upcoming 5G deployments and to find ways to optimize satellite spectrum usage under these new regulations.""

Investment & New Technologies

The other main hurdle that must be cleared in terms of accessibility to Q/V band is the issue of cost and the new technology that must be developed to enable it. At present, the space and ground hardware required is not currently built at high volumes, so affordability is going to be key, but this will require considerable investment. ""Cost will be a big challenge in terms of making these bands accessible. The cost of components needs to be reduced and volume needs to increase before yields can become predictable,"" says Richeson.

This is a similar path to the development of commercial Ka-band that began a couple of decades ago. With the deployment of Ka-band systems still relatively new, it may seem a little premature to be discussing options on what happens next, but satellite operators in particular are keen to see the results of testing in the Q/V band. Their long-term businesses rely upon careful market predictions - trying to figure out what the level of demand will be in the future. If they don't act now, and the HTS market does grow exponentially as predicted, the bandwidth will be required. Nobody wants to be left behind.

In terms of timeframe, there are different opinions out there as to how long this might take. For Boeing, construction of Q/V-band satellites could begin in the short term. ""In addition to the experimental payloads already being flown, we expect to see commercial satellite orders using these bands operationally in the next six to 12 months,"" says Spiwak.

Leroy, however, believes that ""the conditions and timetable for adopting enabling technologies take us into the early part of the next decade."" And Richeson believes that access will take longer - between 10 and 12 years. ""At the moment, there's not much of an appetite - there's a coming glut of capacity, but there are always niche applications that need more bandwidth,"" he says.

So, with testing underway, there are varying levels of inclination to pursue these bands. However, there are clear benefits to be had from using them. Before this happens though, there are some serious hurdles to clear. VS

Telsa ( TSLA ) shares closed up 1.5% Tuesday at $216.99, but then dropped 2% in after hours trading.

The Palo Alto, Calif-based company actually hit its target when one considers the number of vehicles it produced. Tesla built 24,882 vehicles in Q4, resulting in total 2016 production of 83,922 vehicles, an increase of 64% from 2015.

Tesla officials insisted that ""the Q4 delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct.""

Tesla said that nearly 3,000 cars that were out for delivery in Q4 didn't make it into the hands of customers either due to transportation snags or a buyer's inability to take delivery. Nearly 7,000 cars other started their journey to buyers in Q4, and will be counted as sales in Q1 2017.

In the last three months of 2016, Tesla's net orders for Model S and X were 52% higher than Q4 2015 and 24% higher than Q3 2016, officials said.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has vowed to take Tesla from being a builder of luxury, six-figure cars packed with technology - on New Year's Eve Musk activated a new level of self-driving features for 1,000 owners - to a more mass market electric vehicle manufacturer thanks to the forthcoming Model 3 sedan.

Starting at around $35,000, the Model 3 has piqued the interest of many buyers. Nearly 400,000 people have plunked down $1,000 deposits.

Musk has a busy 2017 ahead. Not only is he juggling a $1 billion Gigafactory build-out in Nevada, but he's also busy folding recently purchased SolarCity into the Tesla portfolio, in addition to running rocket company SpaceX.

2432952989,"NASA has awarded four more contracts to Boeing and to SpaceX for space taxi trips to and from the International Space Station - dependent on certification that the spacecraft are safe.

SpaceX is working on a crew-capable version of its Dragon capsule for NASA's use, while Boeing is developing a capsule known as the CST-100 Starliner. Each company has already been given contracts for two flights; the contracts announced today brings the total trips to six for each.

The space taxis haven't yet been tested in flight . SpaceX has scheduled an uncrewed demonstration flight of its Crew Dragon to the space station in November, followed by a crewed flight test in May 2018. Boeing's schedule calls for an uncrewed flight in June 2018 and a crewed flight test in August 2018.

The demonstrations are covered under $6.8 billion in development contracts that NASA awarded in 2014. The 12 flights covered by the follow-up contracts would go ahead once the test flights are flown and NASA certifies the taxis.

The post-certification contract awards do not require NASA to make any payments at this time, but they do provide Boeing and SpaceX with commitments that will help them plan for future needs.

""Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,"" Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a news release . ""The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.""

Since the space shuttle fleet's retirement in 2011, NASA has had to depend on the Russians to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost that now amounts to more than $80 million per seat. SpaceX and Boeing say they can do the job for less.

Each taxi flight calls for transporting up to four astronauts and about 220 pounds of critical cargo, either for scheduled crew rotation or in an emergency lifeboat situation. Both companies would launch from Florida's Space Coast.

Boeing would send the Starliner into orbit using a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 41, while SpaceX would launch its Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39A atop a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX could start using Pad 39A, which served as the departure point for Apollo moon missions and shuttle flights, for satellite launches as early as this month .

Meanwhile, NASA is working on its own launch system for flights beyond Earth orbit. The first flight test of the heavy-lift Space Launch System is scheduled for late 2018. It's due to send an uncrewed Orion space capsule around the moon and back. Crewed flights would follow in the 2020s."
2432957397,"Mark Zuckerberg really wants to escape the Silicon Valley bubble.

""I've spent significant time in many states already, so I'll need to travel to about 30 states this year to complete this challenge,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.

Zuckerberg is famous for his ambitious -- some might say eccentric -- New Year's challenges, including learning Mandarin, meeting a new person every day and only eating meat that he kills himself.

In 2016, he tackled two challenges: running 365 miles in a year and designing a personal AI assistant to help automate tasks in his home.

This year's challenge was informed by what Zuckerberg describes as a ""turning point in history"" caused by the combination of ""technology and globalization."" While Zuckerberg does not refer to the 2016 election explicitly, he alludes to a ""greater sense of division"" in the country and a need to make sure ""the game... works for everyone.""

""After a tumultuous last year, my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future,"" Zuckerberg says.

After Donald Trump won the presidential election, some in Silicon Valley admitted they were disconnected with much of the country. One SpaceX exec, who previously worked for Zuckerberg, went so far as to quit his job to travel the country and bridge the ""Growing gulf... between coastal elites and communities left behind by globalization.""

Now Zuckerberg is following suit -- while keeping his day job, of course.

""Recently, I've traveled around the world and visited many cities,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his post. ""Now I'm excited to explore more of our country and meet more people here."""
2432962978,"About four months after its Falcon 9 exploded on the launch pad, the Elon Musk-led SpaceX rocket company is finally aiming for a return to flight on Sunday, Jan. 8. The Falcon 9 will carry 10 Iridium ( NASDAQ:IRDM ) satellites, designed and manufactured with the help of Thales Alenia Space and Orbital ATK . The launch is of critical importance for SpaceX as the company aims to develop a reputation for reliability, rapid launches, and reusability.

A return to flight

In a Jan. 2 update on its website, SpaceX notes it's planning to launch the 10 Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4E. The flight will take place at approximately 10:28 a.m. EST, Iridium CEO Matt Desch tweeted Monday.

Iridium's 10 satellites are just the first of 81 spacecraft Iridium plans to deploy as part of an unprecedented replacement of an existing satellite constellation. Iridium plans to launch at least 70 of its 81 Iridium NEXT satellites on SpaceX launches.

SpaceX had previously targeted a return to flight in December, but the investigation into SpaceX's anomaly dragged on and delayed this launch further. But SpaceX's planned launch on Jan. 8 is more likely to take place now that the investigation team has identified several causes for the failure and has issued corrective actions.

Investigators concluded the anomaly was due to the failure of a high-pressure helium tank inside the second-stage liquid oxygen tank.

""Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner,"" SpaceX said, ""leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the [high-pressure helium tank].""

SpaceX's launch pad explosion was a major setback for the company. Not only did the explosion delay the company's launch plans, but it destroyed both the rocket and a $200 million payload.

A return to flight is good news for Iridium. A statement from the wireless mobile and data communications network company suggests it is pleased with the target launch date.

""Iridium is pleased with SpaceX's announcement and targeted launch date of January 8 for the first #IridiumNEXT launch,"" the company tweeted on Jan. 2.

Setting the tone for 2017

Before its launch pad anomaly in September, SpaceX's track record was shaping up nicely. The company had successfully delivered eight payloads in a row and boasted six successful experimental rocket landings in 2016 alone. Now SpaceX will need to regain momentum, particularly in light of some of the big milestones the company is aiming to hit in 2017 and 2018.

In 2017, SpaceX is aiming to launch its Falcon Heavy for the first time. Essentially three Falcon 9 rockets strapped together (all which are capable of returning to earth and landing), Falcon Heavy is set to be the world's most powerful rocket in operation.

In 2018, SpaceX is scheduled to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station as part of a NASA contract.

SpaceX's planned Jan. 8 return to flight, which is also the space company's first flight of the year, will help set the tone for the company in 2017. If SpaceX can rebound from its four-month hiatus with a successful launch, it can begin moving closer to making its ambitious plans for launching Falcon Heavy and transporting astronauts to space a reality."
2432969923,"The Entrepreneur Insiders network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America's startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today's answer to the question, ""What important lesson can transform every entrepreneur's business for the better?"" is written by Kunal Sood, founder and CXO of X Fellows, co-founder of Novus, part of the founding team at HaloDrop, and author of Exponential Happiness.

Being ""exponential"" can transform every entrepreneur's business for the better. Being exponential means serving a cause greater than yourself. Building a business with a good bottom line and making yourself wealthy is one thing. But entrepreneurs who accomplish this goal usually ask, ""What next?""

Exponential entrepreneurs are not only concerned with doing well, but doing good. Find your ""why,"" align it with your passion, and continually strive to inspire your team to build something that solves the world's greatest challenges-that's the only way to create the lasting impact that many entrepreneurs seek.

If your business is connected to information, water, energy, or health care, look for ways your company can improve the industry. Constantly striving to solve big challenges brings purpose to your work, and everyone connected to it.

Take [f500link]Apple[/f500link] [fortune-stock symbol=""AAPL""], for instance. It holds the top spot on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies list for the ninth year in a row. The company placed first in nine attribute categories. Bottom line: Apple goes beyond selling computers. The company is exponential. It's purpose-driven. And it's changed the way people live forever.

There's an African Proverb that says, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" Exponential business leaders remove all egos to build stronger relationships with their team and like-minded innovators. You can build something much bigger than yourself-and faster-when you work together.

Building a great business is a marathon. And it's hard to keep pushing forward without a strong ""why."" Knowing your purpose will propel anyone associated with your business forward. It acts as a moral compass, keeping everyone grounded and on course when the inevitable challenges of business arise. The pioneering entrepreneur Peter Diamandis says the best way to predict the future is to create it. If your team is excited about the future you are creating, you'll be collectively unstoppable.

If this sounds compelling, you might be wondering about where to start. You first have to transform yourself from the inside out. Understand your purpose and share that throughout your organization. Then, you must create a culture that is service-orientated and mission-driven. Elon Musk is a good example. As the founder and CEO of SolarCity, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX, he has a mission to change the world and humanity. Ensure that your business decisions are underpinned by moral courage, empathy, and compassion. Lastly, focus on leveraging breakthrough technologies to solve real-world problems in new markets.

For example, technology alone is just a tool to accelerate change. But when used to provide free Internet around the world or deliver medicine to the most impoverished economies, it becomes transformative. Not only does it save billions of lives, but technology also improves quality of life by increasing access and opportunity. Think about how different your life would be without Google, WhatsApp, and Uber. These three platforms allow individuals to take charge of their health when illness strikes. Technology works.

Finally, being exponential may change your business, but more importantly, it will transform you as a leader. A powerful vision that inspires people to solve grand challenges and leverages technological innovation can allow your team to truly change the world, and feel incredible showing up to work each day. My mentor, David Roberts, founder of HaloDrop, explains it with this quote: ""Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something is more important than fear; the brave may not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all."""
2432976413,"2017 got off to a strong start on Wall Street as investors defied some predictions that they were waiting to sell until 2016 had ended in order to defer capital gains for an extra year. Instead, market participants seemed ready to ride the end-of-year positive momentum into January. Although major market benchmarks finished below their highest levels of the day, they nevertheless finished higher by between 0.5% and 1%. Some stocks saw even greater gains, and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) Fitbit climbed 8% after the maker of wearable fitness trackers announced that its Charge 2 tracker had been added into the wellness program at UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH)

Iridium Communications soared 10% after launch specialist SpaceX said that it intends to return to an active launch schedule later this month. Iridium has used SpaceX to help it with its Iridium NEXT program, which involves an updated network of satellites intended to help the global communications company offer better quality for its worldwide satellite-connectivity network. After anticipating a launch schedule that turned out to be incorrectly optimistic, today's news came directly from SpaceX, and so investors are reasonably certain that the next launch date will happen as planned as long as other factors work out well for the company. Given the extent to which Iridium's future relies on a successful NEXT deployment, it's critical that SpaceX not encounter more difficulties ahead.

Finally, Marathon Petroleum climbed 5%. The gains came after the company had a conference call to discuss strategic actions that the refiner intends to take in order to enhance shareholder value, which came in response to calls from activist investors at Elliott Management to look at possible moves to boost the stock further. In particular, Marathon is looking at faster sales of assets to its MPLX master limited partnership, as well as a possible spinoff or sale of its Speedway gas station and convenience store network. With the energy sector having rebounded sharply, now might be a good time for Marathon Petroleum to look at refocusing its efforts through such strategic moves, and investors hope that the net result will be higher share prices going forward."

Funded in part by HSS.

(COMMERCIAL AD)

SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: New Year, new gains. The rally of 2016 sprints into 2017 with triple digit gains. Tonight, how to protect your profits and still leave room for more.

TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Switching gears. Ford cancels plan to build a plan in Mexico as president-elect threatens General Motors (NYSE:GM) with a big border tax.

HERERA: Fine-tuning your 401(k). With pensions disappearing, there are things you can do to shore up your retirement savings.

Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, January 3rd.

MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone and happy New Year.

The stock market got off on a good foot for 2017. Equities rose this first major trading day of the New Year. Early in the day, the Dow came within about 100 points of that yet to be touched 20,000 level, flirting with it as did it for the last couple weeks. But as oil prices slipped, so did stock prices.

The blue chip index added 119, it closed at 19,881. NASDAQ was up 45. And the S&P 500 advanced 19, rising on the first trading day of the New Year for the first time since 2013. With the sharp and steep rise in the stock market over the past couple of months, many investors are wrestling with one big question: will this be the year of the bull`s big finale?

Mike Santoli takes a look.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks are showing new life as 2017 gets underway. The major U.S. index has hit record highs starting in July after moving sideways for more than a year. And confidence has surged among investors and consumers after the election of a president promising business-friendly policies. While these upbeat trends seem to have some momentum, investors should probably view any further gains for stocks as a spirited latter phase of this bull market, not the start of a multiyear boom.

While some talk about it like the Reagan era in the 1980s when tax cuts and a new bull market helped revive American capitalism, the Trump administration will begin against a far different back drop. The S&P 500 is up some 230 percent since March 2009. The index has had a positive return in even of the past eight calendar years, one shy of the nine-year streak in the 1990s.

Unemployment is already near historic lows, and while growth expectations are perking up, stocks now appear fully valued compared to corporate profits, even if earnings continue to rebound as expected.

All this suggests to some market observers that any significant upside might have to come from a classic euphoria phase of this bull market, when the public embraces stocks with enthusiasm and drives indexes up toward an extreme. The upturning surveys and a rush of investor cash from bonds into stocks late last year are hints that such a trend might be underway.

Of course, there`s no signs to pinpoint where we are in the market`s life cycle. The economy might simply continue grinding slowly ahead and carry stock prices with them, or perhaps inflation fears a strong U.S. dollar and possible trade tensions could unnerve world markets and derail that confidence trade. However things turn out, it`s probably best not to expect several more years of smooth gains for stocks which after all have been doing quite well even as the public debate has focused on the economy`s weak spots.

For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HERERA: So, with the rally continuing into the New Year, how do you protect the gains that you`ve seen in your portfolio?

Peter Mallouk is president and chief investment officer of the wealth management firm Creative Planning and he joins us now to talk about that.

Welcome back, Peter. Nice to see you again.

PETER MALLOUK, CREATIVE PLANNING PRESIDENT & CIO: It`s great to be with you again.

HERERA: What is the best strategy? It`s a New Year, but not necessarily a new market.

MALLOUK: Right. I like -- I like to look at the markets and look at your personal portfolio from an opportunistic rebalancing perspectives, which basically means instead of trying to guess when the U.S. is going to stop running the strong and when international is going to turn, when the portfolio gets out of whack, you rebalance right then. You don`t wait for the end of the year. You don`t wait for end of the quarter. You take advantage of it right away.

If you look at last year, not meant you were doing in it February. You were buying energy. You were buying small cap stocks. You`re buying international stocks.

The U.S. has been doing better. Those were very weak. And if you did that, you were greatly rewarded and you will be rewarded over time. And if you`re doing that right now, you`re starting to look at maybe taking some of your U.S. profits and looking overseas a little bit.

MATHISEN: So, buy stuff that is not participated quite as much as other sectors. You know, Peter, I hear an awful lot of commentators these days sort of saying, hey, the market could continue to run here another 10 percent, another 15, whatever, because we`re going to have the prospect of lower taxes, less regulation, maybe more infrastructure spending. When everybody starts to say and think the same thing, that`s when I start to worry.

What are the possibilities that`s something might get in the way of this sort of clear sailing path?

MALLOUK: Well, I think if you look at the market`s valuation from where interest rates are, from where unemployment is, interest rates still near all time lows, unemployment near all time lows, the market is fairly valued. And if you look at all the things you talked about, pulling back on regulations, lowering corporate taxes, repatriation of assets, those drop to the bottom lines for these companies. So, that`s -- it`s not really hypothetical that these companies are going to make more money in this kind of environment.

The question becomes, will we see more growth? And with the low unemployment, even regardless of all the things Trump is talking about, when you have unemployment drop below 5, you start to see wage inflation which starts to drive, you know, more growth.

HERERA: Now, you say -- you gave us a couple of ETF that you think might allow people who want to rebalance their portfolio some diversity.

MALLOUK: Yes, I likes VEA, which has developed markets international, and IEMG, which is emerging markets. In Creative Planning, we believe in being globally diversified all the time. But when you look at the discrepancy that`s happened between international stocks and U.S. stocks, that sort of discrepancy has never been sustained. We never know when it`s going to change, when one is going to start and the others today, indicative of how the year is going to go, nobody knows that.

But this sustained gap of performance is not sustainable. If you`ve got patience and you`re looking for value, well, there is plenty overseas. To the extent you think the U.S. is fully valued, fairly valued, and I do, at Creative Planning we do, you can look at it globally and see a lot of value on the table.

HERERA: Excellent. Peter, thank you for those suggestions. We appreciate it.

MALLOUK: Thanks for having me.

HERERA: Peter Mallouk with Creative Planning.

MATHISEN: The president-elect today targeted another American icon, General Motors (NYSE:GM). He did this just hours before finding out Ford canceled plans to build a small car plant in Mexico. As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to stomp Ford from building that very plant. Now, just weeks from becoming president, Mr. Trump is pushing even harder to change automakers look at building their vehicles south of the border.

Phil LeBeau has the details.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After months of repeatedly saying Ford would not change plans to move small car production to a new plant in Mexico, Ford CEO Mark Fields switched gears, calling President-elect Donald Trump to say Ford is not expanding south of the border, but rather in the U.S.

MARK FIELDS, FORD MOTOR CEO: While we inform President-elect Trump and also Vice President-elect Pence this morning that we were going to be investing $700 million here in our plan in Flat Rock, Michigan, adding 700 jobs on top of the 28,000 jobs that we`ve created over the past five years.

LEBEAU: Ford says it`s not adding a Mexico plant because demand for small cars is showing down. Perhaps. But this is clearly a victory for Donald Trump. While running for president, he hammered automakers for building vehicles in Mexico and importing them tax-free to be sold in the U.S., a message he is still pounding, this time with GM, tweeting, ""General Motors (NYSE:GM) is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax.""

GM responded saying, ""All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM`s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.""

Approximately 4,500 of those hatchbacks sold last year in the States. So, not a huge part of the more than 400,000 vehicles GM imported to the U.S. from Mexico last year.

But in Lordstown, Ohio, where the auto maker is laying off 2,000 workers because of slowing demands for the Cruze, Trump`s message plays well. In fact, Spitzer Chevrolet in Lordstown refuses to sell Cruze models built in Mexico.

BARRY GONIS, SPITZER CHEVROLET: What we said, well, we`re not keeping them on the lot. And we`re sending them out of the area. We want to support our plant and the guys and girls that are up there, third shift. It`s kind of sad what`s happening, so we like to keep them here.

LEBEAU: The big question remains, whether Mexico`s soaring auto production which will top 4 million this year, will eventually lead to a tax being slapped on those models sold in the U.S.

If that happens, how much will those increased costs hurt demand? And the bottom line of auto makers who are increasingly taking a second look at their operations south of the border.

Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MATHISEN: One stock that fell after the Ford`s announcement was Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) (NYSE:KSU). The automaker`s Mexican plant was supposed to have been built along Kansas City Southern`s railway lines. The railroad received nearly half its revenue from its Mexican operations during the first nine months of 2016.

HERERA: The president-elect tapped a new trade ambassador. Robert Lighthizer is a former Reagan administration official. Trump says that he has repeatedly fought to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans. Lighthizer is a critic of China`s trade practices and says he is fully committed to leveling the playing field for American workers.

MATHISEN: The president-elect tweeted his pledge saying the Affordable Care Act, saying, quote, ""It just doesn`t work."" This as the House and Senate convened today for the start of the 115th Congress which saw Paul Ryan easily reelected as House speaker.

John Harwood is outside Trump Tower in New York City with more on the congressional agenda.

John, Congress has an aggressive to do list, beginning with the repeal of Obamacare. I assume that remains the top priority. Did they put in a bill to do it today?

JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they started the process in motion. They passed language for the process that is an expedited process. That means they can reveal big parts of Obamacare with only a majority vote. It does not make it vulnerable to a filibuster by Democrats. That process is going to take a few weeks. It will go through end of January.

But Republicans are on track for what they`re calling a repeal-and-delay strategy to have a phase-in period for some replacement. The question is whether they come up with one or just keep putting it off.

HERERA: Yes.

On the environmental side of things, can we expect to see the reversal of the environmental regulations? And on what kind of a timetable?

HARWOOD: No question about it. There are a couple regulatory bills, rollbacks that they`re passing. Donald Trump vowed to have a policy that repeals two regulations for every new one that is passed. And regulations like the president`s clean power plan, which is now subject to legal challenge, holding up its implementation. That is something that Republicans in the executive branch are going to take a different attitude on, of course, once Donald Trump becomes president.

MATHISEN: All right. John, thank you very much. We have to leave it there.

John Harwood in a rainy New York City tonight.

HERERA: Indeed.

Still ahead, preparing for retirement. If that`s one of your New Year`s resolutions, there are some things you may want to do to maximize your 401(k).

(MUSIC)

MATHISEN: Finland is launching a two-year experiment. The country is providing 2,000 unemployed citizens with a monthly income of roughly US$580. Those receiving the money will continue to do so even after they find work. The government hopes the experiment will cut government red tape, reduce poverty and lower unemployment in that country, which stands now at more than 8 percent.

HERERA: Tesla misses its delivery goal for 2016. That`s where we begin tonight`s ""Market Focus"". The automaker delivered just over 76,000 vehicles last year, missing its target of 80,000. The company noted that more than 2,500 cars in the fourth quarter were not counted as delivered because the vehicles did not make it to the customer in time. Tesla shares initially fell in afterhours trading following the news but ended the regular session up 1.5 percent to $216.99.

Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has officially split into two publicly traded companies. Over the week, the printer and copier maker spun off its business services division called Conduent. That company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange today, opening at $14.90. Separately, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse upgraded Xerox`s stock. So, shares of Xerox (NYSE:XRX) soared almost 20 percent to $6.89, while Conduent shares fell nearly 8 percent to $13.72.

Chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said that it will buy a 15 percent stake in the German digital mapping company called Here. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said it also entered into an agreement with Here where the two companies will research and develop technology for autonomous driving. Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose almost 1 percent to $36.60.

MATHISEN: The molecular diagnostic test maker Interpace Diagnostic said it has signed an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield. Under the deal, Interpace will work with one of the insurer`s programs to help it developed the best ways to secure ongoing coverage for its products and tests in the pipeline. Shares of Interpace skyrocketed 70 percent to $7.50.

Shares of the pharmaceutical company Depomed surged today following a report that said the coil will sell itself and it is accepting final bids tomorrow. According to ""The New York Post"", the private equity firm KKR (NYSE:KKR) is among the potential suitors. Depomed surged nearly 13 percent today to $20.34.

HERERA: Early champions of the 401(k) are having some regrets, reportedly about, the investment resolution that they started. According to the ""Wall Street Journal"", many of the backers say the 401(k) has fallen short of expectations and was never meant to replace pensions.

But it has. So how do you make the most of and it improve your retirement savings?

Tim Maurer, director of personal finance at BAM Alliance joins us now to talk about that.

Happy New Year. Good to see you.

TIM MAURER, BAM ALLIANCE DIRECTOR OF PERSONAL FINANCE: And to you.

HERERA: Tim, what do you make first of ball the article and whether or not those claims, do they resonate with you? And then how can we really help ourselves improve our 401(k) performance?

MAURER: Well, in many ways, they do resonate with me because anyone who is in the financial space as I am, spending all my time working with clients, many times, their retirement objectives, I do see how the 401(k) has been underutilized. I absolutely see how companies in many cases have abdicated the role that they were playing and retirement for their employees` lives through pension plans, by eliminating pension plans and just pointing people in the direction of a 401(k).

And I absolutely see the institutional challenges with big companies filling plans with bad investment that have high expenses. But at the same time, this is option that we have on the table today. And if you utilize a 401(k) correctly, if you know how to hack it a little bit from the institutional problems that it has, you absolutely can make the most of it for yourself and your family.

MATHISEN: When you say hack it, what are you talking about there? Making the right investment choices within the panoply of choices that you have or what?

MAURER: Well, that certainly is part of it, Tyler. One of the reasons the choices are a problem is because most 401(k) plans are run by these big financial firms that fill them up with their own high expense investments. But you can often find index type funds inside of your plan. Well, that`s where I`m referring to with the hacking. You may have to look between the lines in order to find the best options. It should be easier and hopefully it will be going into the future, but you can still absolutely make the most of it.

HERERA: You say there are three things that individuals should be doing to maximize their 401(k) contributions. Tell us about that.

MAURER: Well, the first one is contribute. No matter how many times we want to complain about the options that are available, no matter how many times we want to be concerned with market volatility and the challenges that we all have and investing throughout our lifetimes, the number one predictor of financial success in retirement is the degree to which you apply yourself and your funds that you save. So, let`s not see this news about 401(k)s. It can be a little dreary and use it as reason to abdicate our role in saving for the future.

Number two, we have to do our best to allocate the funds inside. And that`s where we get to Tyler`s point about hacking what might be a mediocre plan. Hopefully, we`re going to see improvement there, especially with the new Department of Labor ruling requiring financial advisers to be fiduciaries this coming April.

But, lastly, you also want to maximize whatever fixed income opportunities that you have. For most of us, that`s still going to be Social Security as the primary. And as we continue on age in the future, I am encouraging retirees to stave off taking their Social Security benefits until as late as possible, because then you will see your Social Security income go up and you will reduce the reliance on your 401(k) and retirement.

HERERA: And on that note, we have to leave it there, Tim. Thank you, Tim Maurer with BAM Alliance.

MAURER: Thank you.

MATHISEN: Coming up, why some in Silicon Valley are giving new meaning to the term ""pet rock.""

HERERA: The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting when it voted to raise interest rates. There will be two competing meetings on Obamacare on Capitol Hill, one with President Obama, and the other with Vice President- elect Pence. And the world`s largest automakers release their sales numbers for December, potentially setting a record for the year. That`s what to watch for on Wednesday.

MATHISEN: The space industry could enter a new phase this year after a number of stumbles. SpaceX plans to resume rocket launches shortly and there`s a lot of money on the line, as private companies shoot for the stars.

Morgan Brennan has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Space Exploration Technologies says its rockets are ready for blast off. The privately held company is targeting a return to flight this Sunday. For months after a Falcon 9 rocket erupted on the Cape Canaveral launch pad, destroying a commercial satellite and halting an aggressive launch schedule.

After an intensive investigation, SpaceX determined that explosion was triggered by the failure of the helium vessel used to help pressurize a liquid oxygen fuel tank. The anomaly initially stumped founder and CEO Elon Musk who called it a, quote, ""toughest puzzle we`ve ever had to solve"" in a CNBC phone interview back in November.

ELON MUSK, SPACEX FOUNDER AND CEO: I think we`ve gotten to the bottom of the problem. Really surprising problem that`s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry, and it basically involves a combination of liquid helium, advanced carbon fiber composites, and solid oxygen -- oxygen so cold that it actually enters solid phase.

MORGAN: SpaceX says it`s taking, quote, ""corrective actions"" to address, quote, ""all credible causes of the explosion"", including long term, some design changes. But to launch, the upstart must first get the green flight from regulators -- a process likely to happen if tests this week go according to plan. Experts say it`s crucial that the company is successful.

DAN DUMBACHER, PURDUE UNIVERSITY: What SpaceX is doing with this launch is another step in exercising commercial entities, to take over the role that has been done by the government in the past so that we can do it more efficiently and then focus our government resources on the next stage of exploration.

MORGAN: Like deep space.

The upcoming launch would put ten Iridium satellites into orbit, the first of seven such trips to replace an aging constellation. That will be in part used to help track aircraft. Shares of Iridium soared on the news.

SpaceX has a $10 billion backlog of launch contracts, and September`s explosion already caused the company at least one order. It also has deals with the Pentagon and NASA, including to shuttle cargo and starting next year, astronauts to the International Space Station. And beyond that, the company`s own plans to go to Mars.

But it all come down to this week and whether SpaceX can finally get back into space.

HERERA: So, what is about it billionaires and space? From Elon Musk to Amazon`s Jeff Bezos, Virgin`s Richard Branson, and Microsoft`s co-founder Paul Allen all have entered the race for civilian space travel. But there`s another space race playing out in Silicon Valley.

Josh Lipton has our story from San Francisco.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Steve Jurvetson knows he might never get to travel to Mars. But that doesn`t mean the respected venture capitalist can`t bring a piece of Mars home. He`s converted his office in Menlo Park, California, into a private museum. It`s filled with treasures, including the second largest Mars rock in private hands.

Jurvetson won`t say how much he paid for the rock, only that it costs more than his first home. To find such space rocks, Jurvetson turns to professional meteorite hunters like Michael Farmer. Since the late 1990s, he has traveled to some 80 countries, searching for these rocks, which he then sells to private collectors, including tech heavyweights like Jurvetson.

MICHAEL FARMER, METEORITE HUNTER: The Silicon Valley guys have been pretty good the last couple of years. They buy a bit different than the Chinese. The Chinese want large iron, large things to put in office lobbies and things like that. Whereas the tech guys, they want rare things. Very, very special things.

LIPTON: Farmer, along with his friend and business partner Greg Hupe, recently returned from Bolivia where they brought several meteorites from Quechua people, a local indigenous community. The rocks were some 4 billion years old. And within 24 hours, they flipped them for $60,000.

This work is not for the faint of heart. In 2011, Farmer was kidnapped, beaten and nearly killed by Kenyan thieves. In that same year, he was charged with illegal mining in Oman and imprisoned for two months. Greg Hupe also counts tech entrepreneurs as his clients, seen here with Naveen Jain, who is the founder of startup Moon Express (NYSE:EXPR), a commercial space company.

Hupe sold Jain two slices of lunar meteorite, each weighing roughly one pound and about the size of a large dinner plate. Each slice of this rock costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. The market for meteorites extends well beyond just tech powerbrokers. Last April, Christie`s held an auction for these rocks and sales totaled some $700,000.

Collectors don`t necessarily think of these space rocks as sound investments. Instead, Jurvetson says he buys meteorites because of the unique, rare story that each ancient rock reveals.

2433290123,"NASA has hired U.S. firms Boeing and SpaceX to ferry more astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), with the first crewed test flight set for as early as May 2018.

In 2014, both private firms entered in to a contract with NASA to carry out a space taxi service but were only offered two missions each.

Now Boeing and SpaceX will get six missions each, but only if their technology can pass NASA certification. At present, NASA astronauts go to and from the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and have done since 2011when NASA last flew its space shuttle mission. ""Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,"" said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division in a press release Tuesday.

""The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program,"" he said.

NASA said Boeing's un-crewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test set for August 2018.

SpaceX progress is reportedly quicker with an unmanned flight test scheduled for November 2017, followed by a crew flight test penciled in for May 2018.

Both companies are looking to launch their services from Florida's ""Space Coast"": Boeing from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and SpaceX at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

"
2433290131,"There's a lot of spaceflight action on tap this year. NASA's venerable Cassini Saturn mission will come to a dramatic end, a new exoplanet-hunting mission is scheduled to lift off and private spaceflight will likely take a number of exciting steps forward.

Here's Space.com's look at what we expect to be the 10 most important spaceflight stories of 2017. 

Cassini's grand finale Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn since July 2004, will perform a dramatic death dive into the gas giant's thick atmosphere on Sept. 15. This suicidal plunge will wrap up the "" Grand Finale "" phase of Cassini's mission: a series of 22 orbits that will take the probe between Saturn and its innermost ring. The first such close flyby will take place on April 22.

The $3.2 billion Cassini-Huygens mission, a joint effort of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, launched in October 1997. The Cassini mothership carried a lander called Huygens, which touched down on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, in January 2005.

Cassini continued circling Saturn, studying the huge planet, its rings and many moons. Cassini has made many important discoveries over the years; for instance, the probe spotted liquid-hydrocarbon lakes on Titan and geysers of water ice blasting from the south polar region of the Saturn moon Enceladus. 

Cassini's death plunge is designed to ensure that the spacecraft doesn't contaminate Titan or Enceladus, - both of which may be capable of supporting life - with microbes from Earth, NASA officials have said.

Dawn's mission coming to a close NASA's Dawn spacecraft is also nearing the end of the road, though its final days won't be as dramatic as Cassini's.

The $467 million Dawn mission launched in September 2007 to study Vesta and Ceres, the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft circled Vesta from July 2011 through September 2012 and reached the dwarf planet Ceres in March 2015, in the process becoming the first probe ever to orbit two bodies beyond the Earth-moon system.

Dawn's observations have revealed a great deal about dry, rocky Vesta and icy Ceres . The probe famously spotted mysterious bright spots within several Ceres craters, for example, and found evidence that water ice is common just beneath the dwarf planet's surface.

Dawn is currently operating on an extended mission, after wrapping up its primary mission in June 2016. But the spacecraft's fuel supplies are low and will likely run out sometime this year, mission team members have said. After Dawn is shut down, the spacecraft will continue orbiting Ceres as an artificial satellite of the dwarf planet indefinitely.

Private moon race in home stretch It's go time for the teams that are still trying to win the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize (GLXP).

GLXP's organizers are offering $20 million to the first privately funded team to land a spacecraft on the moon, have it travel at least 1,650 feet (500 meters) on the lunar surface and beam high-definition photos and video back to Earth. Another $5 million goes to the second team to achieve these tasks, and $5 million more is available for other accomplishments, such as finding water ice on the moon.

Teams have until Dec. 31, 2017, to claim the prize. Five teams remain in the running: Israel-based SpaceIL, Moon Express from the U.S., India-based Team Indus, Hakuto from Japan and the international team Synergy Moon.

Falcon Heavy's maiden launch 

If all goes according to plan, SpaceX's new Falcon Heavy rocket will lift off for the first time this spring or summer.

The Falcon Heavy will be the most powerful rocket in the world by far when it comes online, capable of lofting 60 tons (54 metric tons) to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 24.5 tons (22.2 metric tons) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), according to SpaceX representatives. For comparison, the brawniest rocket currently in operation, United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy, can carry 31.7 tons (28.8 metric tons) to LEO and 15.7 tons (14.2 metric tons) to GTO.

Crew Dragon to take flight Crew Dragon , a capsule SpaceX is developing to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) and other space destinations, should make its maiden orbital flight in 2017. (An uncrewed variant of Dragon already flies cargo to the space station for NASA.)

SpaceX holds a multibillion NASA contract to develop this astronaut taxi (as does aerospace giant Boeing, which is building a capsule called the CST-100 Starliner). The first flight of Crew Dragon, an uncrewed test mission to the ISS, is currently scheduled to lift off in November of this year, NASA officials have said.

The first crewed test flight of the new Dragon should follow in mid-2018 - about the same time that the CST-100 Starliner launches on its maiden (uncrewed) orbital mission.

Blue Origin launching people to space Another private spaceflight company, Washington-based Blue Origin, aims to send people to space before 2017 is done.

Representatives of Blue Origin, which is run by billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, have said that they plan to launch crewed test flights of the company's suborbital New Shepard vehicle sometime this year. Commercial flights with paying passengers should start in 2018, if current timelines hold.

New Shepard has already reached suborbital space five times, on uncrewed test flights that took place between November 2015 and October 2016. All five flights were performed by the same rocket, which has since been retired.

SpaceShipTwo powering up again This year, Virgin Galactic will continue bouncing back from the tragic October 2014 accident that killed co-pilot Michael Alsbury, injured pilot Peter Siebold and destroyed the company's first suborbital space plane, VSS Enterprise.

Virgin unveiled its next spaceship, known as VSS Unity, last February, and the vehicle lifted off for the first time in September. That maiden flight was a ""captive carry"" test, during which Unity stayed attached to its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo.

The space plane flew freely in December , coming back to Earth for a runway landing after its first solo ""glide flight."" Unity will perform a series of glide flights before graduating to rocket-powered test flights - the phase Enterprise was in when it broke apart two years ago.

Cargo vessel to visit Chinese space lab A cargo vehicle is scheduled to visit China's second-ever space lab for the first time this spring.

China launched the lab, known as Tiangong-2, in September, and astronauts docked with the spacecraft a month later. In April, the uncrewed Tianzhou-1 freighter will lift off, on a mission to deliver fuel and other supplies to Tiangong-2. [ Tiangong-2: China's Space Lab for Long Missions (Infographic) ]

Such activities are designed to test the technologies that are needed to build a bona fide space station in Earth orbit, which China hopes to do by the early 2020s.

Four crews launching to the ISS Astronauts will launch toward the International Space Station this year, as they have every year for more than a decade and a half. (The huge orbiting complex has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since November 2000.)

Four crews are scheduled to blast off aboard Russian Soyuz rockets this year - on March 27, May 29, Sept. 12 and Oct. 26. Astronauts' stints aboard the ISS generally last five to six months.

A new exoplanet hunter NASA aims to launch its Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sometime this year; the agency is currently shooting for December, though no firm launch date has been set.

TESS will spend two years looking for alien planets that cross the faces of their parent stars - the same detection strategy that is used by NASA's Kepler space telescope, which has discovered about two-thirds of the 3,500-odd known exoplanets to date.

Kepler stared at more than 150,000 faraway stars during its original planet hunt; TESS, by contrast, will study a smaller number of bright, nearby stars. It should therefore be possible to perform follow-up studies of many TESS finds using other instruments, especially NASA's $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in late 2018, NASA officials have said."
2433363136,"Good morning. Businesses are importing more than technology from Silicon Valley. The mobile, cloud-based, distributed and analyzed platforms developed by consumer internet companies and other tech firms demand a new way of approaching leadership, organization and management. Large corporations are adopting those social aspects of the tech world, and not just within their IT departments. In many cases, these changes are moving all the way up to the level of CEO. Angus Loten and John Simons have the story in today's Journal.

""Companies that transition from a more traditional business model to one built around technology and IT must adopt a management practice that can support this evolution,"" Dave Webb, global chief information officer of Equifax Inc. says. Other large corporations from insurer Liberty Mutual to consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble Co., are making similar changes. At Equifax, senior leadership roles in the product and business units are being filled by former divisional chief information officers. They are broadening the use of so-called agile management techniques, known for shorter and more frequent development cycles that make use of customer data. Equifax says such changes are helping it move beyond its core credit-reporting service.

Traditional hierarchies are being challenged in the process. A few years into her stint running P&G's operations in Asia, Deb Henretta riled her leadership team by insisting that a young, data analyst attend monthly strategy meetings. ""He created algorithms that helped us look at early trends that were starting to indicate a business problem,"" she says, citing reports that synthesized sell-through, customer information, market share and other data flowing into the company through recently deployed digital tools. Says Ted Schadler, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. ""Once digital reaches a certain percentage of your business, you have to reorganize.""

TECH EARNINGS

Tesla's 2016 sales drive comes up a bit short. Tesla Motors Inc.'s fourth-quarter sales rose 27% to 22,000 vehicles, compared with 17,478 a year earlier, the Journal's Tim Higgins reports. Alas it was not enough for the company to reach its goal of 80,000 vehicles for the year. Instead the final tally was 76,230 cars and sport-utility vehicles. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk was aiming for a strong finish to 2016 to help keep investor confidence ahead of the introduction this year of the new Model 3, a $35,000 sedan intended to broaden Tesla's business beyond luxury cars and SUVs.

TECHNOLOGY NEWS

Automation's impact on the routine job. The share of Americans working in a relatively narrow set of repeated tasks, such as welding-machine operators or bank tellers, has fallen from 40.5% in 1979 to 31.2% in 2014, according to new research. Many workers who would typically have held such jobs are taking on lower-paying low-skill manual work or simply dropping out of the labor force, says the WSJ's Lauren Weber, citing findings from the paper, ""Disappearing Routine Jobs.""

Qualcomm to invest in SoftBank's new technology fund. The $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, announced in October, made more news last month when CEO Masayoshi Son met with President-elect Donald Trump in New York and pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create thousands of jobs, the Journal's Liz Hoffman and Ted Greenwald report.

Intel buys 15% stake in German auto makers' digital-map venture. Intel Corp. and Here International B.V., acquired in 2015 from Nokia by BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi unit, aim to jointly develop technology needed to support the real-time updates of traffic and road conditions that are used to enable and ensure the safety of fully automated vehicles, says the Journal's William Boston. The companies also said they plan to explore other business opportunities to develop services that use location data generated by the vehicles and their passengers.

Uber's India challenge. Uber Technologies Inc. has about 400,000 drivers on its platform in India, and wants to add one million in the next two years, the WSJ's Newley Purnell writes. While mobilizing an army of drivers is crucial, it is particularly tough in a country where less than 5% of households own cars and few potential drivers understand English or how to use an app.

SpaceX launches will resume. Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. will resume rocket launches on Jan. 8 after a months-long hiatus, WSJ's Andy Pasztor reports. The tentative blastoff date for the Falcon 9 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base is subject to results of testing later this week. SpaceX will be using revised operational practices developed in response to a fiery accident that occurred during routine ground preparations in September 2016.

Tax advantages for Airbnb users in U.K. A new investigation reveals that Airbnb Inc. can offer travelers tax advantages in the U.K., according to the Guardian and the Financial Times. About one third of the savings the company offers on accommodations in London comes from having a lower tax bill, according to The Guardian. Traditional hotels have to pay expensive business rates on their property and they charge travelers taxes on the entire cost of the stay.

Uber and Lyft could slash need for taxis in NY. New York would only need about 3,000 taxis if more riders were willing to use carpooling services offered by ride-sharing companies instead of riding alone, according to a study cited by the Boston Globe. That's far lower than the 14,000 taxis that are currently in use in New York City. The research was conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

New biometric login system. Sensor firm Synaptics has a new method for combining fingerprint readers and facial recognition on a single device, which would allow facial or fingerprint logins to be used interchangeably or combined, the Verge reports. Most fingerprint readers build additional hardware directly into the sensor because biometric logins are both sensitive and processor-intensive, but the company's new system incorporates facial recognition processing into the same hardware as the fingerprint sensor while integrating with the device's built-in camera, The Verge's Russell Brandom reports. The company has previously announced a partnership to bring fingerprint sensors to Lenovo laptops.

MANAGEMENT

Apps empower workers. New smartphone apps are putting technology directly into the hands of workers and allowing them to share information, make schedule changes, report labor violations and potentially organize for change. Users of Jornaler@, which means laborer in Spanish, can upload photos of license plates and work permits posted at construction sites to capture details about employers. The data can be used to file claims for wage theft, a widespread problem for day laborers, and alert others about unsafe working conditions, the WSJ's Lauren Weber reports.

CES 2017

CES 2017 draws industries beyond tech. More than 170,000 people are expected to attend this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where 3,800 exhibitors will be spread over 2.5 million square feet, WSJ's Tim Higgins and Georgia Wells report. Illustrating how ubiquitous technology has become, some top-billed speakers will come from other industries. This year's speakers range from cruise-ship company Carnival Corp.'s CEO Arnold Donald to Under Armour Inc. CEO Kevin Plank.

Nissan could announce AI integration. Nissan Motor Co. could announce an integration with Microsoft Corp.'s Cortana, an artificially intelligent assistant, according to The Verge. The car manufacturer tweeted a short video with Cortana checking a schedule and teasing some ""exciting announcements"" for a Nissan keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.

Qualcomm looks beyond smartphones with new chip. Like previous Snapdragons, the Snapdragon 835 includes technology expected to improve the performance of coming smartphones incrementally. But the chip includes features designed to process images and sound for augmented reality and virtual reality, and its improved battery life and smaller size might suit it for small, internet-connected devices, says the WSJ's Georgia Wells.

Amazon pursues Alexa everywhere strategy. Expect voice assistant technology to offer greetings from a variety of devices in the coming year, including Whirlpool appliances, as Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft seek distribution deals for their AI technology, ZDNet reports.

2433364844,"NASA has awarded four additional contracts to SpaceX and Boeing for manned flights to and from the International Space Station.

On Tuesday, the administration announced that Boeing, headed by Dennis Muilenburg, and SpaceX, run by Elon Musk, had been awarded the additional missions-bringing each of their total number of NASA contracts to send people into space to six.

""Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,"" Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division said in a statement. ""The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.""

The Commercial Crew Program was created by NASA as a way to put astronauts into space using the private sector. But both Boeing and SpaceX will first have to pass their spacecrafts through NASA certification.

Boeing is scheduled to test an uncrewed version of its proposed flight, the CST-100 Starliner, in June 2018, followed by its crewed flight test in August 2018. SpaceX is expected to demonstrate an uncrewed version of its Crew Dragon flight to the space station in November 2017, followed by a crewed test in May 2018."
2433376777,"Last week, upon leaving the president-elect's office, Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump ""was very interested in a man going to the moon."" Before that point, the entirety of Trump's utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: ""Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!"" and ""Right now, we have bigger problems... We've got to fix our potholes."" Brinkley's remark suggests he might be thinking about a moon base, an idea long-favored by Newt Gingrich, one of Trump's advisers. The constitution of his transition landing team at NASA, which includes lunar advocates, would seem to bear this out.

The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots. Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly self-sustaining, it only takes a few days to reach from Earth. If the U.S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources, the moon and its quarry of helium-3 will be a compelling target. The isotope is extremely rare on Earth because of our magnetosphere. The moon has no such protection, and for billions of years it has collected the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds. There is an estimated 1.1 million metric tons of helium-3 on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year; if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor, we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope, for example, built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earth's ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe.

Chris Carberry, CEO and founder of Explore Mars, a nonprofit Mars advocacy group, argues that far greater opportunities exist on Mars, and that a return to the moon might delay Mars settlement by decades. Mars has carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen-everything a colony needs to be self-sustaining. With those ingredients, you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil. In other words, you can build a base on the moon, but a civilization on Mars. Moreover, Carberry says that the red planet has never been in a better position politically, culturally, or scientifically.

""Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration,"" Carberry says. ""Frankly it would be foolish to throw that away. There's a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill. The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation. The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well. There are many years of bipartisan support for Mars-also for the moon, but the strongest emphasis is on Mars. That goes for industry as well. Boeing, Lockheed, Aerojet Rocketdyne, SpaceX, and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture.""

American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe, which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars. Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency. Since assuming the post, he has argued persuasively that a ""lunar village"" is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station. It would be, in his view, a celestial point of harmony for a terrestrial species in discord. There is a problem, however: the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village, and Russia, ESA's would-be partner in the venture, has no money to commit. They have already been forced to downsize their presence on the ISS due to costs, and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon. (The head of the Russian space agency admits that Russia ""does not have financial capabilities for advanced space projects."") Lacking unity among member states, to say nothing of technology development and financial resources, what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort. NASA's sights, however, are firmly fixed on Mars. With the presidential transition, however, and a new NASA director still to be appointed, lunar champions at home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to the Earth.

To that end, ESA is on a moon base public-relations offensive, from the light and easy (magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations) to bare-knuckled politics (publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue.) The overt message from Paris, where ESA is headquartered, is: We're doing this. The subtext is: While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will never happen, the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining helium-3. But ESA's campaign is powered by handwavium, and for all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon, progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop. If the U.S. doesn't build the base, it won't get built.

Casey Dreier, the director of space policy for the Planetary Society, a nonprofit space advocacy organization, says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon, let alone build a colony, there's no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo-a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed.

""First you'd have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon,"" Dreier says. ""Soyuz [the Russian-built spacecraft] doesn't get to you there."" Even if deep space hardware for multi-week missions existed, however, there's the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space. ""You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for in-orbit assembly of hardware, and that's just to get to the moon."" (Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift.) There's still the most challenging part of the mission: the lander. ""Even more basically,"" says Dreier, ""ESA has to come together formally and commit votes. If there was a serious project, member nations would commit funds and decide things like: What do you do there?""

The moon has always been part of NASA's Journey to Mars program. Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan, cislunar space-the 250,000 miles between the Earth and the moon-is essential. NASA calls it the ""proving grounds,"" and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover, the Space Launch System (the colossal ""Mars rocket"" able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program, the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama. The first stop on Constellation's roadmap was the moon, meaning SLS and Orion, both soon to roll off the assembly line, are moon-ready.

Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon, however ill-advisedly, we should still do so in the context of going to Mars. He points to the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame a space mission. The first time NASA went to the moon, it did so based on single reason: to beat the Soviet Union. Once that singular reason was accomplished, there will little will to maintain momentum. The long-term goal-Here is what this is all building toward-never entered the public policy discussion.

""If you always have something beyond your current goal, it strengthens resolve to keep moving,"" he says. ""You strengthen your argument by making sure you have those longer-term goals-that this doesn't stop at moon. Hopefully it won't come to that. If we can use the surface of moon within the framework of going to Mars, and we can stimulate commercial activity there, that's great, but if we put everything into the moon, we'll be stuck there for decades... Does US want to do a moon program forever? I don't know. Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration.""

That advantage goes beyond national pride. NASA has been successfully landing spacecraft on Mars for 40 years. No other nation has succeeded in doing this even once. Exploring Mars is difficult, as the crashed ESA-Russia Schiaparelli EDM lander confirmed in October. NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions, each more complicated than the last, each developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind. As long as the Mars missions continue, the agency can iterate on its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge. If that knowledge is wasted and manufacturing partners spin down, the entire Mars apparatus will have to be regrown from zero. This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space. Although SLS and Orion are very far along in development, it will still be another five years at least before a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit, replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago.

Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the alternative back by decades. There's simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars. As the ISS demonstrated, building the thing-moon base or Mars colony-is the cheap part. It's the operational costs that bog exploration down. Twenty percent of NASA's budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit. A moon base will entail a similar such slice of the pie, which covers things like maintenance, ground support, technicians, engineers, physicians, launches, hardware, supplies, and food. You don't maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars. Just the opposite: Going to Mars would specifically entail closing the moon base, which places Mars on the other side of lunar exploration, base design, base construction, base operations, base maintenance, and base divestment. NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan's first term. If we build a moon village, we'll be there for a very long time.

Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight. ""To me,"" he says, ""the least interesting argument in space exploration is 'moon or Mars.' It's an important decision, but not an interesting argument. Mars is not objectively the only answer. The fundamental issue at play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation."" What dividends should we look for? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity's failsafe-that once we settle and flourish on a second world, no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth, be it an asteroid or atomic devastation, the human species can survive. NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms, calling it a scientific endeavor through which we can learn about the evolution Earth and life. Either way, those are enticing and worthy goals. Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years, but for that to happen, NASA must stay the course.

2433600890,"Elon Musk's SpaceX has concluded its investigation into the September 2016 Falcon 9 rocket explosion that destroyed the $200 million Amos-6 Israeli communications satellite and pushed back SpaceX's entire launch schedule by months.

The cause? One of the rocket's three helium tanks, called 'composite overwrapped pressure vessels' (COPVs), situated in the second stage liquid oxygen tank, failed.

Specifically, SpaceX said in a blog post on its website that the ""investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV."" The company made no mention to unfounded rumors of sabotage by rival spaceflight firms , which circulated online in the aftermath of the massive explosion.

In layman's terms: COPVs are used to store chilled helium that maintains the tank pressure. The COPVs are lined on the inside with aluminium with a carbon overwrap. The investigation team concluded that buckles in one of the liners led to super chilled liquid oxygen pooling underneath the overwrap. Subsequently, this liquid oxygen became trapped when pressurized, in turn breaking fibers or creating friction that ignited the oxygen.

""In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition,"" said SpaceX.

""The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes.""

SpaceX said it will now be changing the COPV configuration to allow for helium to be loaded at a warmer temperature and returning to a helium loading method used on prior, successful launches. In the long term, SpaceX said it will make design changes to COPVs to prevent buckles from forming altogether.

The investigation conclusion now means SpaceX can resume launch operations after the four-month dry spell. On Sunday January 8, SpaceX will launch with the Iridium NEXT satellite from Vandenberg Space Launch Complex, pending a launch license issued by the FAA. It's good news for Elon Musk. The September 1 explosion and the following hold on SpaceX's launch cycle lost the company the business of European satellite firm Inmarsat, with the company confirming in December it will be moving to launch with Arianespace's Ariane 5 rocket in 2017.

NASA also confirmed last December that the first crewed test flight of SpaceX's Dragon vehicle has been delayed until May 2018. The launch was initially scheduled for August 2017, when the capsule would ferry NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, becoming the first private spacecraft in the world to carry people into orbit. Instead, November 2017 will see an uncrewed test flight for the Dragon capsule that was originally scheduled for May 2017."

2433615379,"NASA said Tuesday it was exercising options for additional commercial missions from Boeing and SpaceX.

The agency will order four additional flights from each company, bring the number of missions ordered from each to six.

The Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts NASA awarded to each company in September 2014 guaranteed each company at least two missions, with options for up to six.

NASA noted that there is no funding provided yet for those additional missions, and that the awards are pending a successful certification of each company's vehicle, which won't be until 2018. [GeekWire]

NASA will announce the winner, or winners, of its latest Discovery planetary science mission competition today. A 4 p.m. Eastern briefing is scheduled where NASA is expected to announce one, or possibly two, missions it will fly from five finalists. Those finalists include both Venus and asteroid missions. While NASA has traditionally selected only one Discovery mission at a time, agency officials have suggested in recent months it is considering selecting two, although when each mission would launch, and how they would fit into the agency's budget, are unclear. [NASA]

An X-ray astronomy spacecraft will be the next mission in NASA's Small Explorers program, the agency announced Tuesday . The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) spacecraft will study black holes and other energetic phenomena by measuring how the X-rays they emit are polarized. The mission won out over two other finalists. The $188 million mission is scheduled for launch in late 2020. [SpaceNews]

The James Webb Space Telescope remains on track to resume vibration testing later this month, NASA confirmed Tuesday . A Dec. 3 test, designed to mimic the vibrations encountered during launch, shut down after instruments detected a ""higher-than-expected response"" at one frequency. Tests of the telescope structure have found no evidence of any damage. Reviews of the anomaly are in progress, and JWST's program manager said plans continue to call for resuming vibration tests later this month. [NASA]

China plans to conduct nearly 30 launches in 2017. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation told state-run media in China Tuesday that those launches will include flights of the new Long March 5 and Long March 7 rocket. Key missions planned for launch in 2017 include the Chang'e-5 lunar sample return mission and the first flight of a Tianzhou cargo spacecraft to the Tiangong-2 lab module. China carried out 22 launches in 2016, a new national record and tied with the United States for the most launches in the year. [gbtimes]

The White House issued a new strategy Tuesday for dealing with the risks posed by near Earth objects (NEOs). The Detecting and Mitigating the Impacts of Earth-Bound Near-Earth Objects (DAMIEN) strategy, developed by an interagency working group, sets out a series of goals regarding the detection of NEOs, development of approaches for deflecting threatening NEOs and emergency procedures in the event of an impact. The strategy document will be followed by an action plan to be updated every three years. [SpacePolicyOnline]

The universe may have slightly less dark matter now than it did early in its history. Russian astrophysicists studied whether dark matter might be unstable and decay over time by examining data from ESA's Planck mission. They concluded the Planck data could be best explained if the early universe had about two to five percent more dark matter than it does today, suggesting that a small amount of dark matter has decayed over time. The composition of dark matter, though, remains unknown. [Space.com]

2433649404,"2016 was an incredible year for technology, and for humanity.

Despite all the negative political-related news, there were 10 tech trends this year that positively transformed humanity.

For this ""2017 Kick-Off"" blog, I reviewed 52 weeks of science and technology breakthroughs, and categorized them into the top 10 tech trends changing our world.

I'm blown away by how palpable the feeling of exponential change has become.

I'm also certain that 99.999 percent of humanity doesn't understand or appreciate the ramifications of what is coming.

In this blog, enjoy the top 10 tech trends of the past 12 months and why they are important to you.

( NOTE : at the end of this blog, I provide a detailed reference for all of the new items below).

Let's dive in...

1. We are hyper-connecting the world

In 2010, 1.8 billion people were connected. Today, that number is about 3 billion, and by 2022 - 2025, that number will expand to include every human on the planet, approaching 8 billion humans.

Unlike when I was connected 20 years ago at 9,600 baud via AOL, the world today is coming online at 1 megabit per second or greater, with access to the world's information on Google, access to the world's products on Amazon, access to massive computing power on AWS and artificial intelligence with Watson... not to mention crowdfunding for capital and crowdsourcing for expertise.

Looking back at 2016, you can feel the acceleration. Here are seven stories that highlight the major advances in our race for global connectivity:

a) Google's 5G Solar Drones Internet Service : Project Skybender is Google's secretive 5G Internet drone initiative. News broke this year that they have been testing these solar-powered drones at Spaceport America in New Mexico to explore ways to deliver high-speed Internet from the air. Their purported millimeter wave technology could deliver data from drones up to 40 times faster than 4G.

b) Facebook's Solar Drone Internet Service : Even before Google, Facebook has been experimenting with a solar-powered drone, also for the express purpose of providing Internet to billions. The drone has the wingspan of an airliner and flies with roughly the power of three blowdryers.

c) ViaSat Plans 1 Terabit Internet Service : ViaSat, a U.S.-based satellite company, has teamed up with Boeing to launch three satellites to provide 1 terabit-per-second Internet connections to remote areas, aircraft and maritime vehicles. ViaSat is scheduled to launch its satellite ViaSat2 in early 2017.

d) OneWeb Raises $1.2B for 900 Satellite Constellation : An ambitious low-Earth Orbit satellite system proposed by my friends Greg Wyler, Paul Jacobs and Richard Branson just closed $1.2 billion in financing. This 900-satellite system will offer global Internet services as soon as 2019.

e) Musk Announces 4,425 Internet Satellite System : Perhaps the most ambitious plan for global Internet domination was proposed this year by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, with plans for SpaceX to deploy a 4,425 low-Earth orbit satellite system to blanket the entire planet in broadband.

2. Solar/Renewables cheaper than coal

We've just exceeded a historic inflection point. 2016 was the year solar and renewable energy became cheaper than coal.

In December, the World Economic Forum reported that solar and wind energy is now the same price or cheaper than new fossil fuel capacity in more than 30 countries.

""As prices for solar and wind power continue their precipitous fall, two-thirds of all nations will reach the point known as ""grid parity"" within a few years, even without subsidies,"" they added.

This is one of the most important developments in the history of humanity, and this year marked a number of major milestones for renewable energy.

Here's 10 data points (stories) I've hand-picked to hammer home the historic nature of this 2016 achievement.

a) 25 percent of the world's power comes from renewables : REN21, a global renewable energy policy network, published a report showing that a quarter of the world's power now comes from renewable energy. International investment in renewable energy reached $286 billion last year (with solar accounting for over $160b of this), and it's accelerating.

b) In India, solar is now cheaper than coal : An amazing milestone indeed, and India is now on track to deploy >100 gigawatts of solar power by 2022.

c) The UK is generating more energy from solar than coal : For the first time in history, this year the U.K. has produced an estimated 6,964 GWh of electricity from solar cells, 10 percent higher than the 6,342 GWh generated by coal.

d) Coal plants being replaced by solar farms : The Nanticoke Generating Station in Ontario, once North America's largest coal plant, will be turned into a solar farm.

e) Coal will never recover : The coal industry, once the backbone of U.S. energy, is fading fast on account of renewables like solar and wind. Official and expert reports now state that it will never recover (e.g. coal power generation in Texas is down from 39 percent in early 2015 to 24.8 percent in May 2016).

f) Scotland generated 106 percent energy from wind : This year, high winds boosted renewable energy output to provide 106 percent of Scotland's electricity needs for a day.

g) Costa Rica ran on renewables for 2+ months : The country ran on 100 percent renewable energy for 76 days.

h) Google to run 100 percent on renewable energy : Google has announced its entire global business will be powered by renewable energy in 2017.

i) City of Las Vegas meets goal of 100 percent power by renewables : Las Vegas's city government now runs entirely on renewable energy.

j) Tesla's Gigafactory : Tesla's $5 billion structure in Nevada will produce 500,000 lithium ion batteries annually and Tesla's Model III vehicle. It is now over 30 percent complete... the 10 million square foot structure is set to be done by 2020. Musk projected that a total of 100 Gigafactories could provide enough storage capacity to run the entire planet on renewables.

3. Glimpsing the end of cancer and disease

Though it may seem hard to believe, the end of cancer and disease is near.

Scientists and researchers have been working diligently to find novel approaches to combating these diseases, and 2016 saw some extraordinary progress in this regard.

Here are my top 10 picks that give me great faith about our abilities to cure cancer and most diseases:

a) Cancer immunotherapy makes strides (extraordinary results) : Immunotherapy involves using a patient's own immune system (in this case, T cells) to fight cancer. Doctors remove immune cells from patients, tag them with ""receptor"" molecules that target the specific cancer, and then infuse the cells back in the body. During the study, 94 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) saw symptoms vanish completely. Patients with other blood cancers had response rates greater than 80 percent, and more than half experienced complete remission.

b) In China, CRISPR/Cas9 used in first human trial : A team of scientists in China (Sichuan University) became the first to treat a human patient with an aggressive form of lung cancer with the groundbreaking CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique.

c) NIH approves human trials using CRISPR : A team of physicians at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine had their project of modifying the immune cells of 18 different cancer patients with the CRISPR-Cas9 system approved by the National Institute of Health. Results are TBD.

d) Giant Leap in treatment of diabetes from Harvard : For the first time, Harvard stem cell researchers created ""insulin producing"" islet cells to cure diabetes in mice. This offers a promising cure in humans as well.

e) HIV genes cut out of live animals using CRISPR : Scientists at the Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Center at Temple University were able to successfully cut out the HIV genes from live animals, and they had over a 50 percent success rate.

f) New treatment causes HIV infected cells to vanish : A team of scientists in the U.K. discovered a new treatment for HIV. The patient was treated with vaccines that helped the body recognize the HIV-infected cells. Then, the drug Vorinostat was administered to activate the dormant cells so they could be spotted by the immune system.

g) CRISPR cures mice of Sickle Cell Disease : CRISPR was used to completely cure sickle cell by editing the errant DNA sequence in mice. The treatment may soon be used to cure this disease, which affects about 100,000 Americans.

h) Eradicating Measles (in the U.S.) : The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that after 50 years, they have successfully eradicated measles in the U.S. This is one of the most contagious diseases around the world.

i) New Ebola vaccine proved to be 100 percent effective : None of the nearly 6,000 individuals vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV in Guinea, a country with more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Ebola, showed any signs of contracting the disease.

j) Eradicating Polio : The World Health Organization has announced that it expects to fully eradicate polio worldwide by Early 2017.

4. Progress on extending human life

I am personally convinced that we are on the verge of significantly impacting human longevity. At a minimum, making ""100 years old the new 60,"" as we say at Human Longevity Inc.

This year, hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into research initiatives and companies focused on extending life.

Here are five of the top stories from 2016 in longevity research:

a) 4 00-Year-old shark discovered : A Greenland shark that could have been over 400 years old was discovered this year, making the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world.

b) Genetically reversing aging : With an experiment that replicated stem cell-like conditions, Salk Institute researchers made human skin cells in a dish look and behave young again, and mice with premature aging disease were rejuvenated with a 30 percent increase in lifespan. The Salk Institute expects to see this work in human trials in less than 10 years.

c) 25 percent life extension based on removal of senescent cells : Published in the medical journal Nature, cell biologists Darren Baker and Jan van Deursen have found that systematically removing a category of living, stagnant cells can extend the life of mice by 25 percent.

d) Funding for anti-aging startups : Jeff Bezos and the Mayo Clinic-backed Anti-Aging Startup Unity Biotechnology with $116 million. The company will focus on medicines to slow the effects of age-related diseases by removing senescent cells (as mentioned in the article above).

e) Young blood experiments show promising results for longevity : Sakura Minami and her colleagues at Alkahest, a company specializing in blood-derived therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, have found that simply injecting older mice with the plasma of young humans twice a week improved the mice's cognitive functions as well as their physical performance. This practice has seen a 30 percent increase in lifespan, and increase in muscle tissue and cognitive function.

5. Amazing successes with stem cells

I've increasingly become confident and passionate about stem cells, the regenerative engine of the body, to help cure disease and extend the healthy human lifespan. I previously wrote about stem cells and the incredible work from Dr. Robert (Bob) Hariri here .

Below are my top three stories demonstrating the incredible research and implications for stem cells in 2016:

a) Stem cells able to grow new human eyes : Biologists led by Kohji Nishida at Osaka University in Japan have discovered a new way to nurture and grow the tissues that make up the human eyeball. The scientists are able to grow retinas, corneas, the eye's lens, and more using only a small sample of adult skin.

b) Stem cell injections help stroke victims walk again : In a study out of Stanford, of 18 stroke victims who agreed to stem cells treatments, seven of them showed remarkable motor function improvements. This treatment could work for other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease.

c) Stem cells help paralyzed victim gain use of arms : Doctors from the USC Neurorestoration Center and Keck Medicine of USC injected stem cells into the damaged cervical spine of a recently paralyzed 21-year-old man. Three months later, he showed dramatic improvement in sensation and movement of both arms.

6. The Year of Autonomous Vehicles

2016 was definitely the year of the autonomous vehicle.

As Google, Tesla and Uber lead the charge, almost every major car company is investing heavily in autonomy.

This will be one of the defining technology developments of the decade ― soon we may well look back in shock that we ever let humans drive cars on their own...

In looking back at the last 12 months, here are the top nine developments in self-driving cars:

a) Autonomous Uber operational in Pittsburgh : Uber's self-driving autonomous cars began picking up passengers in Pittsburgh this year. They also attempted a rollout in San Francisco.

b) Uber's self-driving trucks made a delivery of 50,000 beers : This year, Uber acquired autonomous truck company Otto, and the retrofitted 18-wheeler made its first delivery... 50,000 cans of Budweiser.

c) Every Tesla Will Be Fully Autonomous in 2017 : Elon Musk announced that all new Tesla cars will have Level 5 autonomy. This means that by 2017, Tesla cars will be fully capable of driving themselves with zero interaction from a human driver.

d) Ford targets 2021 for autonomous vehicle release : Ford announces intention to deliver high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle for ridesharing in 2021.

e) GM's first fully autonomous car : The company plans to bring its fully electric self-driving cars to the masses by launching its first driverless cars on Lyft.

f) Google creates Waymo to support self-driving car technology : Google spun out its self-driving car unit as its own separate entity called Waymo.

g) Google plans ride-sharing service with Chrysler : Google will deploy a semi-autonomous version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan by as soon as the end of 2017.

h) Autonomy will kill car ownership : A former Tesla and BMW exec said that self-driving cars would start to kill car ownership in just five years. John Zimmer, the cofounder and president of Lyft, said in September that car ownership would ""all but end"" in cities by 2025.

i) Self-Driving Tractors Hit Farms : The self-driving tractors can deliver faster, more precise results than their human-controlled counterparts.

7. Here Come Drones and Flying Cars

Quadcopters and multicopters big and small made huge strides in 2016.

We are headed towards a world where autonomous drones will image the world at millimeter resolution, deliver products and packages, and transport humans to remote areas that were previously inaccessible by roads.

Here were the top six drone and ""flying car"" developments this year:

a) Amazon Prime Air Made Its First Delivery : Amazon's drone delivery program ""Prime Air"" made its first delivery in the U.K. this year. Expect a much bigger rollout in 2017.

b) The 7-11 convenience store leads : Convenience store 7-11 made 77 drone deliveries this year, beating Amazon by a long shot.

c) Mercedes commits $500M to drone delivery : Mercedes-Benz vans and drone tech startup Matternet have created a concept car called a Vision Van. The van's rooftop serves as a launch and landing pad for Matternet's new M2 drones.

d) Larry Page funding flying cars : Reports this year suggest Google cofounder Larry Page has been personally funding a pair of startups devoted to creating flying cars. He has purportedly put over $100 million into the ventures.

e) 1,000 organ transplant deliveries from drone ordered : Last year we saw Chinese company eHang announce the first human-carrying drone. Recently, United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt announced a deal to fund 1,000 retrofitted eHang drones to provide organ deliveries to transplant patients, as part of Rothblatt's Manufactured Organ Transport Helicopter (MOTH) system.

f) Uber launched its Elevate program : Global transportation giant Uber announced its plans to enter the ""flying car"" service arena by publishing a massive whitepaper this year detailing its plan to launch an ""on demand aviation"" service called Uber Elevate.

8. The March of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most important technology humanity will ever develop. I believe AI is a massive opportunity for humanity, not a threat.

Broadly, AI is the ability of a computer to understand your question, to search its vast memory banks, and to give you the best, most accurate answer.

AI will also help humanity fundamentally solve its grandest challenges.

You may think of early versions of AI as Siri on your iPhone, or IBM's Watson supercomputer, but what is coming is truly awesome.

Here are 10 of the most important stories for the past year:

a) NVIDIA revealed a deep-learning computer chipset : The Tesla P100, Nvidia's newly announced 15-billion-transistor chip, is designed specifically for deep-learning A.I. technology. Hardware advances like this are rapidly accelerating AI developments.

b) $5M IBM Watson AI XPRIZE : The XPRIZE Foundation and IBM Watson, in partnership with TED, announced a $5M purse for the team able to develop an AI that can collaborate with humans to solve grand challenges. The top three teams will compete on the TED stage in the spring of 2020.

c) AIs can read your lips : A new AI lip reader out of Oxford called LipNet was built to process whole sentences at a time. LipNet was 1.78 times more accurate than human lip readers in translating the same sentences.

d) AI's predict election better than humans : MogIA, an AI system developed by an Indian startup, correctly predicted the outcome of this year's elections. It based its analysis on 20 million data points from platforms such as Google, Twitter and YouTube.

e) AI System beats 500-to-1 odds, predicts the Kentucky Derby trifecta : A startup called Unanimous AI built a swarm system in which individuals within a group influence each other's decision making. The swarm correctly predicted the top four finishers - known as a superfecta - beating 540 to 1 odds.

f) Microsoft speech recognition tech scores better than humans : Microsoft's new speech recognition technology is able to transcribe conversational speech as well as (or even better than) humans. The technology scored a word error rate (WER) of 5.9 percent.

g) AI-Written novel passes first round of literary award : Titled 'The Day A Computer Writes A Novel,' the short story was a team effort between human authors, led by Hitoshi Matsubara from the Future University Hakodate, and, well, a computer.

h) AI saves woman's life : Reports assert that Japanese doctors have, for the first time in history, used artificial intelligence from IBM's Watson system to detect a rare type of leukemia, helping to save a patient's life.

i) AI's beat human pilot in air combat : Retired United States Air Force Colonel Gene Lee recently went up against ALPHA, an artificial intelligence developed by a University of Cincinnati doctoral graduate in a high-fidelity air combat simulator. The Colonel lost to the AI.

j) Deep Mind beats world's GO champion : The Go-playing AI ""AlphaGo"" from Google's DeepMind beat the reigning Go world champion, winning the five-game series 4-1 overall. This is a major achievement in the field of AI and deep learning.

9. Physics & Exploration

This year saw a number of fundamental achievements in physics, as well as a number of notable discoveries in our quest to explore the cosmos.

Here are the top three stories for your consideration:

a) Gravitational Waves Confirmed : After decades of searching, scientists have succeeded in detecting gravitational waves from the violent merger of two massive black holes.

b) Evidence found for ""Planet Nine"" : This year, more evidence arose suggesting there is, in fact, another giant, icy planet circling at the edges of our solar system.

c) Earth-size planet around Proxima Centauri : A new planet that bears striking similarities to our own planet prompts remarkable inroads into the study of space. This also brings a new area to search for the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

10. Conquest of Commercial Space

We are living during the birth of the commercial space era, driven by passionate billionaire backers.

Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Planetary Resources and various teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE are building commercial rockets and spacecraft to explore the cosmos.

It is an incredibly exciting time for commercial space - here are the top four developments from the past 12 months.

a) Bezos announced 'New Glenn' : Jeff Bezos announced a massive new reusable rocket family in development for his private spaceflight company Blue Origin. The rocket, called New Glenn, will be used to launch satellites and people into space, according to Bezos.

b) Four companies sign private contracts to fly to moon in 2017 : The teams are competing to win the $20 million Google Lunar XPRIZE to become to the first private team to land a spacecraft on the moon. The companies are: Moon Express, SpaceIL, Synergy Moon and Team-Indus.

c) Musk announces Mars plans : SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he will put a person on Mars by 2025. There are four key things we will need to get there: full reusability, refueling in orbit, propellant production on Mars, and a propellant that works.

d) Breakthrough Starshot Project targets interstellar travel : Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announced their collaborative venture ""Breakthrough Starshot"" - a $100 million attempt to make an interstellar starship.

2433672097,"Maybe it shouldn't be that surprising that Amazon has patented a system for delivering goods via a dedicated network of underground tunnels. After all, the Seattle-based company is looking into virtually every other mode of transportation.

But the idea seem ambitious, even for America's largest online retailer.

Amazon has experimented with delivery services that make use of autonomous drones , bicycle couriers and branded fleets of airplanes and trucks . There's talk of self-driving trucks , flying warehouses and a system that would let drones hitchhike on trucks and buses .

Even the patent for Amazon's Treasure Truck leaves the door open for Treasure Boats as well .

Amazon's patent application for a dedicated network delivery system, above or below ground, was filed almost three years ago. The patent was finally issued and published a little more than a month ago.

This diagram shows how a dedicated delivery network could drop off packages at multiple destinations. (Amazon Illustration via USPTO)

The 33-page application lays out the specifications for a network that could transport packages via conveyor belts or rails, or even through pneumatic tubes. ( Hyperloop fans , take note.)

The system could connect rail stations, airports, fulfillment centers, locker storage site and, of course, customers. In the application, Amazon inventor Xiaoshan Cai says such a system ""may avoid congestion experienced by traditional transportation networks.""

There's no indication that Amazon is actually planning to build such a network anytime soon, but other companies are thinking about it.

For instance, a British company called Mole Solutions has proposed building a network of pipelines for freight delivery. It's even set up a 344-foot-long (105-meter-long) demonstrator track to test the technology.

And then there's the Hyperloop concept , laid out three and a half years ago by Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. That concept calls for building a network of tubes that magnetically levitating pods can zoom through at near-supersonic speeds.

A couple of ventures, including Hyperloop One , are trying to commercialize the idea for freight shipments as well as passenger transport.

Hyperloop networks are typically envisioned as above-ground tube systems, but last month, Musk said he was seriously thinking about getting into the tunnel-boring business . He's even added tunnels to his Twitter bio (along with Tesla, SpaceX and OpenAI).

Anyone familiar with the twists and turns of Seattle's tunneling tale knows that boring a hole in the ground is not as easy as some might think. But is it possible that Musk and Amazon's engineers are on to something? This may be a subject worth digging into after all."

With this launch, SKY Perfect JSAT aims to maintain stable satellite communications services in Japan."
2433725523,"NASA has booked more astronaut flights to the International Space Station aboard private space taxis built by Boeing and SpaceX.

The new orders, which NASA announced Tuesday (Jan. 3), awards four crew rotation flights to the International Space Station (ISS) each to Boeing and SpaceX as part of the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. The award increases the total number of flights ordered from each contractor to six, NASA officials wrote in the announcement.

These missions will be approved to fly after NASA certification, and will not include payments at this time. [SpaceX's Crewed Dragon Spaceship in Pictures]

""Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,"" Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a statement. ""The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program."" The news comes as both SpaceX and Boeing are preparing for their first crewed flight tests in 2018. Under the current schedule, SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will fly an uncrewed mission in November, and then launch a crewed test flight in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner is scheduled to fly its first uncrewed test flight in June 2018, which will be followed by a crewed flight later in August of next year. Estimated flight dates have been pushed back several times before, however.

Each vehicle will carry up to four astronauts and 220 lbs. (100 kilograms) of cargo to the ISS. They can also serve as ""lifeboats"" to bring astronauts back to Earth in the event of an emergency. [In Pictures: Boeing's CST-100 Starliner]

Since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011, the agency has had to depend on buying seats aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which launch from Kazakhstan, to fly American astronauts to the space station. NASA currently has contracts with Russia's Roscosmos space agency to fly astronauts on six Soyuz flights in 2017 (for a total of $458 million). The agency to fly astronauts on six more flights in 2018. 

NASA's Commercial Crew Program aims to restart crewed launches from American soil in 2018. Another long-range goal is to increase the crew size on the space station. Russia's Soyuz vehicles can only carry up to three people at a time. The Dragon and Starliner vehicles, by contrast, are designed to carry up to seven astronauts per flight. With more astronauts on the space station, NASA plans to increase the research time available on the orbiting complex.

In recent years, observers have also expressed concerns about relying on a foreign government to send Americans to the space station, especially when political disputes occurred between Russia and the United States. Further, Russia is dependent on agreements with Kazakhstan for its Soyuz launches.

Both Boeing and SpaceX will launch from facilities near Orlando, Florida. SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will leave Earth from Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The two companies have been upgrading human space transportation facilities in Florida to support these missions, from what was used during the space shuttle program."
2433768965,"Port Canaveral officials are trying to line up federal and state money for a new bridge over the barge canal along State Road 401.

The bridge would replace an aging drawbridge there that port officials blame for both traffic tie-ups and potential safety issues on the road that leads to cruise terminals on the northern side of the port.

""This is definitely a priority of mine,"" Port Canaveral Chief Executive Officer John Murray told port commissioners at their latest meeting. ""The bottom line is our cruise numbers are strong right now, and we can't afford to lose the support of the cruise lines and their guests because we've got a lousy infrastructure getting to and from the ships. It's a multifaceted issue.""

But the fix won't be cheap. Murray said the port's preferred option - a new fixed-span bridge with a 65-foot clearance so that no drawbridge is needed - would cost an estimated $99.8 million. That doesn't include the still-to-be-determined cost of modifications to the State Road 528 interchange leading to SR 401.

While the port currently is spearheading efforts to seek money for the bridge replacement, it would be the state that would be responsible for doing the work on the state road if the project moves forward.

Canaveral Port Authority Chairman Tom Weinberg said: ""It's going to be a heavy lift for this community, for this port, for all of us. We've got some work to do.""

The problem is that, when the drawbridge is raised, traffic is backed going to and from the port for as long as 10 minutes or more. And since the bridge has a clearance of only 25 feet, it has to be raised for even some sailboats and fishing boats. Traffic is sometimes backed up onto SR 528, Murray said.

Murray said that could happen 10 or more times on a weekend day, when cruise ship traffic is heaviest.

Murray also is concerned that the aging drawbridge structures that date back to 1963 and 1972 could malfunction, cutting off access to that side of the port. In addition to its four cruise terminals, the port's north side is home to fuel storage, cargo operations, a SpaceX complex and U.S. Navy and Coast Guard facilities.

""We're a key component to the Central Florida fuel supply,"" Murray said, referring to the Seaport Canaveral fuel tank facilities on the port's north side. ""We really are part of the critical infrastructure of the state.""

Murray said, for the time being, the port is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Florida Department of Transportation and the drawbridge operators to help better coordinate the opening of the drawbridge. That includes trying to wait until at least several boats are queued up before the bridge is opened.

Murray is hoping to tap into money from the federal Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, which authorizes $305 billion during the 2016 through 2020 budget years for a range of transportation needs, with a focus on safety and intermodal transportation systems.

""We think this would be a great case for the FAST Act,"" Murray said. ""This is a critical infrastructure for the state of Florida. It's an important initiative. There is a strategic need"" for a new bridge.

The port would need to get the state's support on designating replacement of the SR 401 bridge a high priority to help secure federal money from the FAST Act - and likely money from the state as well.

Murray said the port is working with the Florida Department of Transportation ""to make that a state priority.""

Among less expensive alternatives to a fixed-span bridge with a 65-foot clearance, according to a preliminary Florida Department of Transportation evaluation of SR 401 bridge alternatives:

An estimated $46 million to retrofit the existing ""bascule"" drawbridge with a similar drawbridge, keeping the clearance at 25 feet.

An estimated $83.9 million to replace the drawbridge with a drawbridge that has a clearance of 40 feet to 45 feet, reducing the frequency of bridge openings to allow boats to pass underneath. This also would require additional money for SR 528 interchange modifications.

But Murray said having a drawbridge, rather than a taller fixed bridge, doesn't solve the underlying issues related to traffic and potential malfunctions.

He realizes, though, that lining up the federal and state money will not be easy.

""You don't just say: 'Hey, let's build a $100 million bridge, and let's use your money,' "" Murray said.

Murray said he had no idea how quickly the port could get funding lined up and the get the state committed to replacing the bridge.

""You're moving at the speed of government,"" Murray said.

2433950172,"Two commercial satellite operators, Intelsat of Luxembourg and Japan-based Sky Perfect JSAT, have committed future spacecraft to launching on Ariane 5 rockets, European launch provider Arianespace said Jan. 4.

Arianespace will also seek to tie its record number of launches with 12 missions planned this year. The company first reached this cadence in 2015, and was on track to tie it again last year were it not for a shipping issue that delayed the launch of DSN-1, a Japanese X-band military communications satellite damaged en route Europe's Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana.

Intelsat's new launch contract with Arianespace is for Intelsat-39, a C- and Ku-band satellite from manufacturer Space Systems Loral, designed with coverage over Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The launch is slated for the second half of 2018.

The Sky Perfect JSAT mission follows in 2019 for JCsat-17, an S-band satellite under construction at Lockheed Martin.

Arianespace's 12 planned missions for 2017 consist of seven Ariane 5 launches, three Vega launches and two Europeanized Soyuz. That includes the second Ariane 5 launch to carry four Galileo navigation satellites on a single rocket, and the Inmarsat/Hellas-Sat joint-satellite Europasat/Hellas-Sat-3, which Inmarsat switched over from SpaceX due to continued slips in the launch schedule for Falcon Heavy.

For 2016, Arianespace reported 1.4 billion euros in annual revenue - matching the record set last year - and a backlog worth 5.2 billion euros. Much of this backlog, which consists of 55 launches, is thanks to OneWeb, which has 21 Soyuz missions booked. Arianespace said in a Jan. 4 statement that the first OneWeb launch could happen in the first half of 2018. The other 34 launches are spread across 31 customers.

Arianespace's first mission of the year is the Soyuz launch of Hispasat-36G. Set for Jan. 27, the original launch was planned for 2013 but went off track due to manufacturing issues. OHB SE of Germany is the prime contractor for the satellite."

2434054437,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) - NASA has chosen Boulder's Southwest Research Institute to lead a Discovery mission to perform the first survey of the Trojans, a population of asteroids orbiting with Jupiter.

The Daily Camera reports (http://bit.ly/2jcpNqI) that the spacecraft, named Lucy, will launch in 2021 to study six of the asteroids.

Chief scientist with the Boulder institute, Harold Levinson, called the mission a ""unique opportunity."" He says in a statement the asteroids ""hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system.""

Scientists will use the Lockheed Martin spacecraft and remote-sensing technology to get a close-up view of the asteroids.

After its 2021 launch, Lucy will go on to study six Trojans and one main-belt asteroid. It's scheduled to hit its targets between 2025 and 2033."
2434140450,"Tesla Motors has begun pumping out battery cells at its mushrooming Gigafactory just east of Reno, the company announced Wednesday.

Tesla, in partnership with Japanese battery-maker Panasonic, successfully tested a batch of its lithium-ion cells last month. The lipstick-case-shaped cells are the life-blood of both electric cars as well as Tesla's line of electricity storage units.

The initial run of batteries will be built by ""several thousand"" employees, but that workforce will swell to 6,500 at peak production sometime next year. According to a company statement, that 2018 peak would yield ""35 GWh/year (gigawatt-hours per year) of lithium-ion battery cells, nearly as much as the rest of the entire world's battery production combined.""

Tesla officials say that ultimately employment at the Gigafactory will top out at 10,000, with an additional 20,000 to 30,000 jobs created ""in the surrounding regions."" That's in line with previous job projections.

Gigafactory is a third complete, covering 5million square feet on several floors. It is expected to cost $5billion.

Tesla's U.S. job creation claims come at a time when the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump has been squarely focused on job flight. On Tuesday, Ford Motor, which has been criticized by Trump for manufacturing its cars outside the country, announced that it was scrapping plans for a new plant in Mexico and instead would reinvest in an existing facility in Michigan.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is part of a Trump economic advisory committee that includes Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi.

The new batteries, which previously had to be shipped to Tesla from Japan, initially will be installed in the company's Powerwall and Powerpack storage units.

Eventually, the batteries will find their way into Tesla's forthcoming Model 3 sedan, a comparatively mass-market product that starts at $35,000 compared to the nearly $100,000 for loaded versions of the Model S and X sedans. Model 3 should begin production this summer.

The Model S and X will, for now, continue to use batteries imported from Japan.

Dubbed the 2170 Cell, the U.S.-made battery is critical to Tesla's mission of making electric vehicles affordable.

""By bringing down the cost of batteries, we can make our products available to more and more people, allowing us to make the biggest possible impact on transitioning the world to sustainable energy,"" the company said.

Musk, who also runs rocket company SpaceX, has a broad vision for the Tesla brand, which now includes solar panel manufacturer SolarCity. The idea is to have consumers drop into a Tesla showroom to purchase solar panels, a Powerwall unit to store the electricity, and a car.

Analysts have been impressed with Musk's plans but remain concerned about his ability to meet investor expectations.

While the ISS is 109-meters (357 feet) wide, almost the size of a football field, the sun is 12 million times larger, over 1.3914 million kilometers (864,576 miles) in diameter. That's the equivalent of a fly ash in a football field. But because the station runs in the low Earth orbit, it is much closer to the camera than the sun, allowing a play of perspective that captures both man-made and natural space objects in the same frame.

Take a look at a few more amazing shots by NASA photographers, during the last orbital period of planet earth:

"
2434390919,"The new year finds NASA beset by uncertainty, especially with regard to its human spaceflight programs. Soon, the agency will be without its current leadership. Administrator Charlie Bolden has told his team he will leave office at noon on January 20, along with his boss, President Barack Obama. And as yet there is no clear direction for what comes next from the Trump administration and its space transition team, which remain locked in a struggle over the future direction of the agency.

It's not a good time for uncertain leadership, as many of NASA's human spaceflight initiatives face serious questions. As 2017 begins, recurring issues with the Russian Soyuz launch vehicle have left the agency unable to say when its next astronaut will go into space. Its much-anticipated private space taxis remain more than a year from flight. And questions remain about the viability of its big-ticket programs, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft.

One should never count the space agency out, of course, as it works with a large number of aerospace contractors and has thousands of talented engineers and scientists at field centers. But as one former astronaut told Ars, ""Human space flight has created the situation that it is waiting for leadership to make progress in significant ways. The big question is who will lead them out of this hole?""

Soyuz

NASA's problems start with Russia. Since the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, there has been only one pathway for astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station-Russia's Soyuz rocket and spacecraft. Unfortunately, on December 1, a Soyuz rocket carrying an uncrewed Progress spacecraft exploded about six minutes into flight, wiping out 2.6 tons of food, fuel, and supplies. This was due to a problem with the rocket's third-stage engine, the kerosene-fueled RD-0110.

The Progress spacecraft launched on an older Soyuz-U rocket, which is being phased out by Roscosmos. Crewed launches now take place on a more modern Soyuz-FG rocket, but the two rockets share a common third stage. This is the second time the third-stage engine has failed in some way in the last five years, as a similar problem occurred during the 2011 launch of Progress 44P.

What this means for the next crew launch to the station is unclear. Nominally, NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are due to launch in March; on New Year's Eve Roscosmos released a revised schedule calling for a March 27 crewed launch. However that presumes the investigation of the December 1 failure is complete, and Russia has a plan to either address the third stage issue or will accelerate its plan to transition to a modern (but less proven) Soyuz-2-1a variant, which has an entirely different third stage.

According to one NASA source familiar with the Russian space program, the agency has heard ""only rumors"" regarding a return to flight date for the Progress vehicle, which would need to occur before humans fly into space again. Thus, NASA's only lifeline to the station appears to be shaky heading into the new year.

Commercial crew

This was to be the year when NASA would finally regain the capability to launch its own astronauts into space through its commercial crew program. However, Boeing and SpaceX have already slipped the dates of their first operational flights into 2018, and further delays are possible.

That means NASA has to hope Russia keeps the Soyuz safely flying for another two years, and it must also contemplate the politically sensitive topic of procuring more Soyuz seats in 2019. Congress will not be happy about receiving this request. While earlier delays with the private spacecraft were due to under-funding, Congressional outlays have recently matched NASA's requests for commercial crew funding. So delays beyond 2017 are due to technical problems with the companies' designs and NASA's own management of the program.

The issue of commercial crew delays is likely to be one of the first decisions that will confront a new administrator of NASA, given that there is no guarantee Boeing's Starliner of SpaceX's Crew Dragon vehicles will be ready to fly two years from now. How will he or she explain this to Congress?

SLS and Orion

For the last six years, NASA and Congress have been in lock step about the future of the agency, touting construction of the large Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft for deep space exploration. But there has been a dawning realization that a space program predicated on a flight rate of once per year will be difficult to sustain. With the possible launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket this year, some members of the Trump administration's transition team are also asking questions about the need for NASA to build a heavy lift rocket on its own, at a cost of about $10 billion.

There are also rumors about potential delays with the first launch of the SLS rocket, which will propel an Orion spacecraft around the Moon in a flight known as Exploration Mission 1 . Some of the problems cannot be blamed on NASA, as they stem from slower-than-anticipated development of Orion's service module by the European Space Agency. But it is also conceivable that the agency will run into problems when it integrates the various components of the SLS rocket-its core tanks, the side-mounted boosters, and upper stage-for tests later this year and in early 2018.

NASA has told Congress for several years now that Exploration Mission 1 would launch in September, 2018. However there is now a very real possibility that this demonstration mission will slip into at least early 2019. That is the same year yet another privately developed heavy lift rocket, Blue Origin's New Glenn , could begin launching, raising further questions about the need for NASA's own hardware."

NASA says its Discovery program of planetary science missions is back on track after picking two asteroid missions Wednesday . Lucy, scheduled for launch in 2021, will travel to asteroids known as Trojans that share Jupiter's orbit around the sun and may be relics from the formation of the solar system. Psyche, set to launch in 2023, will visit the metal asteroid of the same name that may be the remnant of the core of a planet that broke apart in the early history of the solar system. NASA also decided to fund continued studies of NEOCam, a space telescope designed to look for near Earth objects, for an additional year. The selection of the missions, the first chosen in the Discovery program since 2012, are intended to put the program back onto a path of choosing new missions approximately every three years.

A director with the Indian space agency ISRO said Wednesday that a PSLV launch scheduled for February will now carry 103 satellites, up from 83 previously announced for the mission. All but three of the satellites are foreign, and virtually all are cubesat-class spacecraft. ISRO didn't disclose which satellites are being added to the launch. The launch's primary payload is the Cartosat-2D remote sensing spacecraft. [PTI]

A puzzling astronomical phenomenon has been tracked down to a galaxy far, far away. So-called ""fast radio bursts"" last for just a fraction of a second, but have the power equivalent of up to half a billion suns. Astronomers have struggled to pinpoint where these bursts originate, but in a study published this week were able to identify the location for one such burst, which comes from a dwarf galaxy far smaller than the Milky Way and 2.5 billion light-years away. What causes such bursts is still unclear. [Nature]

2434643492,"Just two weeks before it flies to space, the core stage of the next Atlas 5 rocket was erected aboard the mobile launcher platform this morning by United Launch Alliance technicians to kick off a streamlined vehicle assembly that will break a record.

Never before has an Atlas 5 stacking process started this close to flight, but it is part of the company's ""span reductions"" initiative to increase available slots in the manifest while cutting costs.

Previous marks - as measured from commencing stacking to rollout - have shrunk from 43 days to 25 days to 21 days to 17 days for the 401-configured Atlas 5 over the past few years. If all goes according to plan, this mission will total just 13 days.

The initiative has targeted more efficient subsystem testing, improvements in screening to catch component issues sooner and development of time- and labor-saving changes to standard operations.

Atlas 5 saw 90-day processing times when the vehicle first began flying 15 years ago. But the maturing of systems and hardware allowed, for example, the elimination of time-consuming Wet Dress Rehearsals for most missions.

This morning, the 106.6-foot-long, 12.5-foot-diameter bronze-colored booster stage was erected upright and then maneuvered into the Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral's Complex 41. It is a milestone known as Launch Vehicle On Stand, or LVOS.

Next, the combined interstage, Centaur upper stage and boattail will be hoisted and attached to complete the basic build up of the first Atlas 5 to fly in 2017.

Installation of the payload will occur next week to top off the 189-foot-tall rocket. Rollout to the launch pad occurs the day before liftoff.

The mission, slated for Jan. 19 at 7:46 p.m. EST (0046 GMT), will launch the latest infrared sentinel for the U.S. military's highest priority space program - proving early-warning surveillance of missile attacks.

This third Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous satellite, or SBIRS GEO Flight 3, will operate 22,300 miles above Earth and simultaneously scan the globe and stare at any suspect area to detect the heat plumes of launching missiles.

Lockheed Martin made the highly complex $1.2 billion satellite.

In a typical year, about 8,000 infrared events and 200 missile flights are observed and tracked by the military's satellite network.

SBIRS GEO Flight 3 spacecraft will join a constellation of long-lived Defense Support Program satellites in geosynchronous orbit, SBIRS instruments hosted aboard three classified National Reconnaissance Office spy satellites in highly elliptical, highly inclined orbits and the first two advanced SBIRS GEO birds deployed in 2011 and 2013.

They all work together for persistent monitoring of the entire planet to spot ascending missiles and provide alerts to the U.S. civilian leadership, deployed military forces and the nation's allies.

The Defense Support Program began the operational early-warning system 46 years ago for Cold War threat monitoring. But SBIRS expands the original detection task to support missile defense, battlespace awareness and tactical intelligence by seeing dimmer targets with better sensitivity.

The GEO 3 launch was delayed from its original October launch slot to investigate problems with the orbit-raising engines on two other satellites last summer. Officials eventually cleared SBIRS to fly as-is.

""Assured access to space is a prime National Security Space directive. A fundamental part of assured access to space is safely getting our satellites to orbit which is extraordinarily challenging and technical,"" said Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, the Space and Missile Systems Center commander and Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space.

""Ensuring the safety of our national security space assets is critical.""

This launch is the first of two planned by Atlas 5 in January. The classified NROL-79 payload for the National Reconnaissance Office is scheduled for liftoff some time between 5 and 7 p.m. local on Jan. 26 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California."
2434646613,"From Battlestar Galactica to the imperial Death Star, the world of fiction is rife with gargantuan spacecraft capable of supporting thousands of residents with their own personal quarters and facilities.

But for real astronauts, spaceflight is not quite so, well, spacious. Take the International Space Station (ISS), which is the largest spacefaring vessel ever built, as well as the most expensive single construction project in human history, costing the US alone around $100 billion. Its first module was launched in November 1998, and its first long-duration crew, consisting of three people, arrived onboard two years later.

With an internal pressurized volume of 32,898 cubic feet, roughly equal to the interior of a Boeing 747, the ISS is a far cry from the cavernous starships we're used to seeing in science fiction and fantasy. That said, the station and its predecessors are enormously helpful testbeds in the quest to develop even more massive spaceships down the line. Like the Mir space station, which flew from 1986 to 2001 , the modules of the ISS were launched separately and assembled in space, like some high-stakes orbital LEGO kit.

The cost of blasting separate components out of Earth's powerful gravitational grasp is exorbitant, but the microgravity environment into which they are deployed offers considerable advantages for large engineering projects. What better place to construct colossal architectures than outer space, where immensely heavy structures are rendered functionally weightless and easily maneuverable by smaller spacecraft, or human astronauts? Indeed, anyone who has toyed around with the Kerbal Space Program is probably already familiar with the benefits of in situ orbital manufacturing.

Of course, there's a big difference between throwing together spacecraft in a computer game, and assembling them in real life. Fortunately, the global space community has been steadily working towards achieving the centuries-old dream of big off-Earth structures that can support both robotic and human spaceflight missions.

Just last month, for instance, NASA announced its finalists for the Breakthrough, Innovative and Game-changing (BIG) Idea Challenge, which annually solicits concepts for emerging spaceflight platforms. In 2017, the BIG Challenge is focusing on designing modular spacecraft, powered by solar electric propulsion, that could ferry cargo from low Earth orbit to lunar distant retrograde orbit (LDRO).

According to Keith Belvin, the principal technologist for structures, materials and nanotechnology at NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate-and a judge for the BIG Challenge-LDRO is a particularly useful place to park and assemble large spacecraft because it has a much weaker gravity well relative to low Earth orbit.

""LDRO is about a 6,000 kilometer orbit [around the Moon],"" Belvin told me over the phone. ""It's really nice for a lot of reasons. It's pretty easy to access. It's pretty easy to leave from. So, that could form a good staging location. If we developed a satellite assembly construction i n situ manufacturing servicing capability in this orbit, then we could launch vehicles in pieces, and assemble them in that orbit.""

LDRO could even function as a service and refueling checkpoint for spacecraft returning from distant locations around the solar system. ""Let's suppose that we go to Phobos [one of Mars' two moons] or do a Mars-type mission,"" Belvin said. ""When the vehicle comes back, instead of coming back to Earth and burning up, we would bring it back to LDRO, refurbish it, and use it again for another mission.""

The ability to reuse spacecraft in this way would drastically reduce the cost of robotic deep space exploration, while also spurring the kind of infrastructures crucial for human exploration to more distant worlds like Mars. It will take an enormous amount of money, time, and effort to build these orbital truck-stops, but the back-end payoff of paving a super-roadway in space would be well worth it, according to author and spaceflight advocate Howard Bloom.

""Why move NASA into space highway construction?"" Bloom asked in a recent Scientific American article. ""Because no one else will do it. And our future in space depends on it. Our future share in a space economy that United Launch Alliance (a joint venture rocket company from Boeing and Lockheed Martin) estimates will be worth $2.7 trillion in 30 years.""

This notion of building cumulatively larger, more robust, and more efficient modular structures in space could lay the groundwork for the kinds of futuristic space communities we've grown accustomed to seeing in fiction-like O'Neill cylinders or city-sized starships-even if that process takes decades, or even centuries.

In the meantime, there are plenty of other massive spacecraft concepts aimed towards solving problems on our own planet. One of the most prominent is the longstanding dream of building solar power plants in space, where sunlight is abundant and unfiltered by atmospheric interference. Over time, researchers have produced numerous captivating concept designs for space-based solar arrays measuring a kilometer across, or more. These systems could deliver green energy to locations all around the world, while also powering orbital systems or deep space missions.

There are many hurdles left to clear before this lofty goal can be accomplished, but scientists, including Belvin, think space-based solar power is a technically sound possibility over the near term.

""I think the technology is almost there,"" Belvin told me. ""There's a lot of engineering that has to take place to make it efficient and cost-effective. But I think of the Apollo Program, starting in the early 1960s, and that had to be a dream, to go to the Moon. If there's the money, and the will, you can do a lot in a decade. So, if anybody says: 'Hey, we've got to have an orbiting power system,' for whatever reason, I think we could do it within a decade.""

It's exciting to know that the space sector is beginning to close in on these ambitious projects, constrained mainly by funding and resources rather than the technology itself. And while it's tricky to predict what kind of vessel will overtake the ISS as the largest spacefaring structure in history, the fact that there are so many potential candidates in the works right now is a cause for celebration."

2434653699,"SpaceX is targeting return to flight from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) with the Iridium NEXT launch on January 8. Over the past four months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the U.S. Air Force (USAF), NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and industry experts, have collaborated with SpaceX to determine the cause of the anomaly that occurred Sept. 1, 2016 at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis and concluded that one of the three Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage Liquid Oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV, SpaceX reported in a statement.

Each stage of Falcon 9 uses COPVs to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure, and each COPV consists of an aluminum inner liner with a carbon overwrap. The recovered COPVs showed buckles in their liners. Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail. In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen (SOX), which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.

The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. According to a statement by SpaceX, the corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes, which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which aim to allow for faster loading operations."

2434711063,"What should Donald Trump have NASA do? Today Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos voiced his support for the idea that the space agency should help build a ""highway in the sky"" analogous to the interstate highway system that President Dwight Eisenhower ramped up in the 1950s.

The backing came in the form of an eight-word tweet , accompanied by a link to an article by Howard Bloom appearing in Salon (and as a guest blog posting on Scientific American's website as well).

I agree we need a superhighway in space. https://t.co/iEVk7nP3aA

- Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) January 5, 2017

Bloom, who made a name for himself as a music industry publicist in the '70s and '80s, is now an advocate for space commercialization and the founder of the Space Development Sterring Committee .

It's rare that Bezos tweets at all, but Bloom's posting - and Bezos' endorsement - are notable for several other reasons:

Bloom argues that, under Trump, NASA should ""get out of the rocket business"" and focus on elements of space infrastructure such as in-space refueling depots, space habitats, off-world fuel and oxygen production facilities and space tugs. 

Bloom wants to see NASA scrap its heavy-lift Space Launch System, and turn instead to commercial rocket providers such as SpaceX and Bezos' own rocket venture, Blue Origin . 

Bezos has voiced an interest in building space infrastructure several times over the past couple of years - most notably last October , when he compared the task to the groundwork that gave rise to Amazon.com in the 1990s. ""I'm using my Amazon winnings to do a new piece of heavy-lifting infrastructure,"" he said. 

Bezos and other tech industry leaders took part in a summit meeting with Trump last month, and afterward the Amazon CEO said he ""shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech - agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing - everywhere."" 

The Trump transition team is still in flux when it comes to space policy, but last week The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., appears to be the leading candidate to become NASA's administrator . Bridenstine, a former fighter pilot (and rocket racer), is a strong proponent of commercializing space operations and putting a permanent base on the moon . 

Bezos has hinted that Blue Origin is working on a heavy-lift rocket that's capable of taking on moon missions , dubbed New Armstrong. And yes, it's named after the late Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the lunar surface.

What does all this add up to? Maybe not much more than eight words - or maybe a whole new perspective on NASA's human spaceflight program. Let's see what happens once the new administration fills out its space policy team, which will most likely be led by Vice President Mike Pence."

Well, maybe not all systems.

""The FAA has not yet issued a license to SpaceX for a launch in January,"" the Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday. ""The FAA continues to work closely with SpaceX as they conduct the investigation and prepare for future Falcon 9 launches.""

SpaceX saw its rocket go up in flames at the Cape Canaveral launch pad on September 1.

Soon after, the company - along with NASA, the FAA, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board - conducted an in-depth investigation into the explosion.

The explosion was a severe setback for Musk, who said in September that the error was ""turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.""

SpaceX said it would launch another rocket in November, but the investigation dragged on. Launch was pushed back to December, and then to this year.

On Monday, SpaceX announced that the probe had concluded that a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank was to blame for the blast. In that same release, SpaceX said it's aiming to launch on Sunday, January 8.

To keep to that schedule, the company will need the FAA to sign off on the report and give it a special license before Sunday.

According to Musk's tweet, a hold-down firing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has been tested at the Vandenberg Air Force base in California, where the launch is slated to take place.

Within months of being selected, in May 2015 Boeing received its first PCM mission award, as part of its $4.2 billion slice of the CCtCap contract. It was noted at the time that this and future orders would typically be made two to three years ahead of flight, thereby providing sufficient time for the fabrication and integration both the spacecraft and its launch vehicle. Boeing's CST-100 vehicle-subsequently renamed ""Starliner""-will fly atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V booster, whilst SpaceX's Crew Dragon will ride the Upgraded Falcon 9. Both capsule-based spacecraft can deliver long-duration crews and up to 220 pounds (100 kg) of payloads to the space station, remain docked for around seven months, and provide an emergency-return capability if needed.

Subsequent contracts were awarded later in 2015, with SpaceX receiving its first PCM in November and Boeing acquiring its second award in December. More recently, last July, SpaceX picked up a second PCM, and Tuesday's announcement provides for a total of six Starliner and six Crew Dragon missions by the projected end of ISS operations in December 2024. However, juxtaposed against this progress has been NASA's struggle to secure full Congressional funding for the Commercial Crew Program and the frustration of Administrator Charlie Bolden was barely veiled in a 5 August 2015 letter to the leadership of the committees responsible for the space agency's annual budget. This led to a $490 million modification of the uneasy contract with Russia, which currently provides the United States with its sole means of getting astronauts to the space station.

In the meantime, efforts to develop the spacecraft and rockets for the inaugural Commercial Crew flights continued. By the fall of 2015, the Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF)-formerly part of the shuttle-era Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida was formally unveiled and by mid-2016 the crew module for the Starliner Structural Test Article (STA) was assembled and the upper and lower pressure domes for the first flight-like vehicle were delivered for checkout. Elsewhere, SpaceX worked to weld pressure vessels onto four Crew Dragons at its Hawthorne, Calif., headquarters. Two of these vehicles would be utilized for qualification tests and the others for actual missions. In the meantime, the Crew Access Tower (CAT) for Starliner operations at Space Launch Complex (SLC)-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station began to take shape, as revealed in an AmericaSpace imagery feature.

Although four NASA veterans-Eric Boe, Doug Hurley, Sunita Williams, and former Chief Astronaut Bob Behnken-were assigned in July 2015 to the initial Starliner and Crew Dragon test flights, it remains to be seen which missions they will respectively fly. ""No Commercial Crew assignments have been made at this time,"" NASA's Brandi Dean told AmericaSpace. ""The four astronauts ... have been designated as part of the Commercial Crew 'cadre', but no decisions have been announced as to who will fly on what flight or even the order that the vehicles will fly in."" Last April, Boe and Williams tried out new-generation touchscreen simulators of Starliner at Boeing's St. Louis facility in Missouri.

Whether a Starliner or a Crew Dragon, the reality remains that neither Commercial Crew vehicle will reach space in an uncrewed or piloted configuration before 2018. Last May, Boeing confirmed to investors that its crewed Starliner test flight had moved from its original December 2017 target to no sooner than 2018. It is currently understood that the uncrewed Starliner test flight will now launch no earlier than June 2018, followed by the piloted test flight a couple of months later, no sooner than August. It was reported at the time that issues related to Starliner's mass, together with software and aeroacoustic concerns associated with integration with the Atlas V launch vehicle, were to blame.

As outlined by AmericaSpace's Mike Killian, SpaceX confirmed last month that it had pushed the first piloted mission of its Crew Dragon to May 2018, although the uncrewed test flight remains targeted for launch in November 2017. The uncrewed missions are expected to visit the space station for approximately 30 days-via the recently-installed International Docking Adapter (IDA)-2 interface on the forward ""end"" of the Harmony node-whilst the piloted missions by Boe, Hurley, Williams, and Behnken are expected to fly for around 14 days in duration.

A recent report from NASA's Office of Inspector-General on Commercial Crew indicated that the delays might stretch even further to the right, with astronauts not reaching space aboard either Starliners or Crew Dragons until the fall of 2018. This represents a delay of more than three years beyond NASA's original goal of restoring its capability to launch U.S. astronauts, from U.S. soil, and aboard a U.S. spacecraft, for the first time since the end of the space shuttle era. The OIG report, published last September, highlighted that Congressional funding shortfalls have ""contributed"" to the delay, but that ""technical challenges"" with the spacecraft designs were now ""driving the schedule slippages.""

NASA has previously emphasized that the orders awarded to Boeing and SpaceX do not necessarily imply that Crew Dragon will fly ahead of Starliner, or vice-versa. However, with neither craft expected to reach space before the middle of 2018, a highly undesirable seven years will have elapsed since the last U.S. piloted spacecraft returned to Earth from its final mission. This is significantly longer than the almost-six-year span between the end of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission in July 1975 and the maiden voyage of Space Shuttle Columbia in April 1981. And although U.S. astronauts have maintained a continuous presence in space during the interim, the fact remains that the uneasy relationship with Russia will continue for the foreseeable future."

2435351692,"SpaceX's launch team fueled up a Falcon 9 rocket on a California launch pad Thursday, fired the booster's nine Merlin engines, and passed a key preflight test for the first time since a Falcon 9 exploded during a similar practice countdown in September.

The customary launch rehearsal, called a static fire test, helps clear the way for the rocket's blastoff next week with 10 next-generation Iridium voice and data relay satellites.

The launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's Central Coast will be SpaceX's first mission since a Sept. 1 rocket explosion on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, when a Falcon 9 blew apart during fueling for a static fire test a few days before a launch with the Amos 6 communications satellite owned by Spacecom Ltd. of Israel.

The mishap destroyed the rocket and the Amos 6 spacecraft, and left SpaceX's Complex 40 launch pad in Florida with major damage.

SpaceX has changed the practice of conducting the static fire tests with satellites on-board in the wake of the Sept. 1 explosion, and Iridium's 10 communications craft will be mated to the Falcon 9 this weekend ahead of launch next week.

Ground crews planned to return the two-stage rocket to its assembly hangar, where the Iridium payloads are already encapsulated inside the Falcon 9's clamshell-like nose fairing.

The 229-foot (70-meter) rocket will be returned to the Space Launch Complex 4-East launch pad at Vandenberg ahead of launch next week.

SpaceX announced the completion of its investigation into the Sept. 1 explosion Monday, concluding that one of three composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVs, inside the second stage's liquid oxygen tank suddenly ruptured during fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket.

""Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV,"" SpaceX said in a statement posted to the company's website.

The Hawthorne, California-based company said in the announcement it planned the Falcon 9 rocket's return-to-flight mission Sunday, Jan. 8. But preparations for the static fire took longer than expected, and sources said the launch has been pushed back to no earlier than Monday.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which has regulatory oversight for commercial space launch activity, must receive SpaceX's inquiry report and sign off on the results, then issue a launch license for the Iridium Next mission, the first of at least seven SpaceX launches planned for the mobile telecom provider.

As of Thursday, the FAA had not approved the license for the Iridium Next launch.

According to SpaceX, the Falcon 9 second stage's design has the COPVs, which are used to store cold helium to pressurize the rocket's propellant system, inside the liquid oxygen tank.

Both stages of the Falcon 9 consume a mixture of kerosene and liquid oxygen.

The latest version of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket burns super-chilled propellants, with liquid oxygen stored at minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 206 degrees Celsius) and RP-1 kerosene at around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 degrees Celsius). The liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellants are normally kept at around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 183 degrees Celsius) and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).

The colder temperatures make the propellants more dense, allowing the rocket to hold more fuel and its engines to generate more thrust.

Each high-pressure helium tank is made with an aluminum inner liner overwrapped with carbon, and experts sifting through debris scattered by the rocket explosion found buckles in the COPVs recovered around the launch pad.

""Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap,"" SpaceX said. ""When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail.""

SpaceX said investigators determined that the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, a condition that ""exacerbates"" the chance of oxygen becoming trapped and the likelihood of friction ignition.

Engineers were unable to come to a definitive cause for the explosion, which occurred so fast that only 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first sign of ""anomalous data"" until the loss of the second stage, SpaceX said.

""The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solid oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,"" SpaceX said in the Jan. 2 statement. ""The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes.

""In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads,"" SpaceX said. ""In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations."""

Astronomers believe that some pulsars are active only part of the time. Observations from the Arecibo radio observatory found one pulsar that sends out regular radio pulses just 30 percent of the time, while another pulsar is active only 0.8 percent of the time. Astronomers don't know what would cause the pulsars to transmit only intermittently, but speculate an irregular magnetic field may cause the stars to spin up and down, thus appearing to turn on and off. The discoveries mean there may be many more pulsars than originally thought if some of them are transmitting radio pulses, and thus can be discovered, only a fraction of the time. [Space.com]

2435433021,"Update: Due to forecasts of heavy rains in California this week, Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch said the launch has been postponed until Saturday, Jan. 14th. at 12:54pm ET.

Original Story: The Federal Aviation Administration issued a launch license to SpaceX on Friday. The company's Falcon 9 rocket will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California. This license formally grants SpaceX permission to return to flight after a September 1 accident that led to a total loss of the rocket and its satellite payload. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has already said the rocket is ready, having completed its static firing test on Thursday. The FAA has also licensed six additional flights for SpaceX out of Vandenberg.

SpaceX will be launching 10 Iridium NEXT satellites for its return-to-flight mission. According to Virginia-based Iridium Communications, SpaceX will attempt a launch on Monday, January 9, if weather permits. Monday's proposed flight would complete a remarkably short turnaround from September's accident, in which one of three composite overwrapped pressure vessels inside the rocket's second stage liquid oxygen tank failed.

The FAA license notes that SpaceX will fly the newest, Version 1.2 configuration of its Falcon 9 rocket. This upgraded variant of the booster includes the updated Merlin-1D rocket engine and uses chilled, densified propellant. Combined, the rocket and propellant add about 30 percent to the overall lift performance of the Falcon 9. SpaceX hopes to recover the rocket on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean.

If SpaceX is successful with next week's flight, it has a busy manifest ahead. It could attempt to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, carrying the Echostar 23 communication satellite, by January 26. The company also has a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, CRS-10, planned for early February."
2435444016,"The Federal Aviation Administration Friday issued SpaceX a license for its upcoming launch, which has been postponed until Monday. 

The Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX has been trying to get its rockets back into space since September, when one of its Falcon 9 rockets carrying a multimillion dollar satellite exploded on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral. 

Monday's flight will carry 10 satellites for Iridium Communications' Iridium Next satellite constellation.

It was originally scheduled for Sunday, but a public affairs officer at Vandenburg Air Force Base told CNBC Friday that the launch is now tentatively scheduled for Monday at around 10:22 a.m. local time.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" the FAA said in a statement.

The AMOS-6 was the satellite, reportedly valued at more than $200 million, which burned up along with the SpaceX rocket on Sept. 1 of last year.

In a statement on SpaceX's website this week, the company said the investigation showed that the explosion was caused by the failure of a vessel full of helium, used to maintain tank pressure inside the rocket's liquid oxygen tanks.

SpaceX wasn't immediately available to provide further details on the upcoming launch."

2435483377,"Elon Musk has ambitious goals for SpaceX in the next couple of years. The company plans to launch its new massive rocket, the Falcon Heavy, as it works toward flying an unmanned spacecraft to Mars next year. It also is planning to fly astronauts to the International Space Station by 2018, a feat that would return the United States to human spaceflight.

Before it embarks on all of that, however, it first has to launch what would normally be a routine flight of commercial satellites to orbit. But that launch, scheduled for Monday, is now anything but routine - and is instead one of the most important in history of the company.

The launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base is the first since SpaceX's rocket exploded on Sept. 1 while being fueled ahead of an engine test fire. That explosion was the company's second failure in less than two years - in 2015, it lost a rocket a couple minutes into flight - leading to questions about its ability to fly reliably.

In addition to the goals of Mars and resuming the nation's manned spaceflight program, the company also has a massive backlog of launches that was delayed while the company was grounded during its four-month investigation.

The stakes for this flight, then, are huge, said Todd Harrison, the director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

""They've got to prove it and restore confidence in their system on this flight,"" he said. ""If they have another failure, it's going to stop them dead in their tracks.""

On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration cleared the way for SpaceX's launch. The agency accepted SpaceX's investigative report on its rocket explosion, closing the case, and issued it a launch license.

On Thursday, Musk tweeted that SpaceX successfully performed an engine test firing and wrote that, ""All systems are go for launch next week."" Originally, the launch was scheduled for Sunday, and it was unclear why the schedule slipped a day to Monday.

Earlier this week, the company said the cause of the September explosion was traced to a problem with a pressure vessel in the second-stage liquid oxygen tank. The tank buckled, the company said, and supercooled liquid oxygen pooled in the lining. The fuel was ignited by breaking fibers or friction.

SpaceX said in the short term, it plans to change the way it loads fuel. Eventually, it plans to change the design of the pressure vessels to prevent buckling.

Every launch carries the risk of failure, said Jim Muncy, the president of PoliSpace, a consulting firm. SpaceX's Falcon 9 is a ""proven vehicle,"" he said. SpaceX continually tries to innovate, and had been super cooling its fuel to make it more dense so that the rocket could carry more of it.

The extra fuel was necessary as the company began flying its rocket boosters back to land - or to ships at sea - so that they could be reused. But taking such advanced steps - no one had ever successfully landed an orbital-class rocket before - can cause problems, Muncy said.

""As you try to increase performance, you find out if you're pushing the envelope too far,"" he said. ""They're clearly pulling back and not pushing the envelope as much with this launch.""

The launch, which would carry 10 Iridium communications satellites to orbit, is scheduled for Monday at 1:22 p.m. Eastern time - weather permitting."

[Via Satellite 01-06-2016] Auburn University 's Small Satellite Program is looking to foster energy and growth in the small satellite sector. The program equips students from freshman up to graduate level to build, launch and operate cubesat programs, teaching them to manage the entire process.

The university currently has one satellite in orbit, AubieSat 1, launched in 2011, which successfully tested solar cell encapsulates on solar panels until about two years ago. Now, through a $1 million, four-year grant obtained in 2015 from the National Science Foundation (NSF), students are working to build two 6U satellites in collaboration with the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The satellites will determine the structure of terrestrial gamma ray flashes produced by thunderstorms, J.M. Wersinger, program director for AU's Small Satellite Program told Via Satellite. For this project, between 40 and 50 AU students with guidance from advisors and faculty, are working to build the two satellites, which will capture gamma rays from different angles.

""The students do the work. For them, it's a great way to learn about a project, how a project is run, the process from conception to operations, and going through all the phases of systems engineering. This is one of the most important things they learn because they can apply it to anything after that,"" said Wersinger. ""We focus a lot on the systems engineering process, mission definition and requirements as we move from project to mission requirements to system and subsystem requirements and components, etc. Designing these systems, testing and verification is done against requirements, which is an extremely important skill for these students to learn.""

Wersinger boasts that many of the students go on to have prosperous careers in the satellite industry, many take internships at NASA , one has gone on to have an internship with SpaceX and he tells of one student who had a job made specifically for him at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

""We tend to get very motivated students who take ownership. Some exhibit leadership qualities on the get-go. They are driven by excitement ... They are learning and developing skills that put them ahead of the majority of job seekers in engineering when they graduate,"" Wersinger said.

Launching the spacecraft is possible through the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI), which provides free launches to education programs' CubeSats. The first satellite, AubieSat 1, launched aboard a Delta 2 rocket as part of NASA's ELANA 3 mission, which launched six cubesats in total from the Vandenburg Air Force Base in California. And while Wersinger is pleased with the grants the program has received, he is hoping to collect more to keep the program focused on research and development going forward.

""Until about two to three years ago we were mainly an educational program, but we have now transitioned to an R&D program. We developed cubesats with other people to carry their instruments be it science or technology,"" said Wersinger.

Now, he's hoping to move the program into the next step by adding a strong research dimension to the educational effort, much like Surrey Satellite Technology , which began as a university program and has moved to providing incubators for fledging space businesses .

""We are in the process of writing more proposals to insure continuity in the program,"" said Wersinger, who said the university is working with the military to develop ideas and has recently submitted a proposal for a cubesat that can enable high-speed communications in space. ""Our goal is to launch small satellites every other year in the near future.""

With the success of small satellites in the space sector, Wersinger is confident there will be more projects out there for AU students to benefit from going forward.

""Everyone understands that there is no more money at NASA to continue building monsters that take 15 years to complete and are very risk averse and often when the technology goes into space, it's no longer current. Whereas, with cubesats you can go from an idea to something that is ready for space in about three years, which means the technology is current, and it's not as risk averse because they are so much cheaper to build and launch,"" said Wersinger.

""These cubesats are not expensive when compared to the large satellites, which cost into the hundreds of millions of dollars. This program goes to maybe $200,000 in terms of hardware,"" he adds.

2435534938,"The Federal Aviation Administration has granted a launch license for SpaceX's deployment of 10 Iridium communications satellites next week after reviewing the company's inquiry into a Falcon 9 rocket explosion in September, an agency spokesperson said Friday.

The FAA has regulatory oversight authority over commercial space activities in the United States, with responsibility for the safety of the public and property pertaining to commercial launch operations.

SpaceX led the investigation into the Sept. 1 explosion, which occurred during fueling for a prelaunch engine firing on the Complex 40 launch pad at Cape Canaveral.

While the inquiry did not identify a single root cause for the mishap, the company's engineers determined a high-pressure helium vessel inside the Falcon 9's second stage liquid oxygen tank burst. The helium tank - called a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV - most likely failed when liquid oxygen filled a void created when the vessel's liner buckled, and breaking fibers or friction ignited and led to the rupture of the second stage.

The COPVs are immersed inside the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage.

The sudden explosion destroyed the Falcon 9 rocket and the Israeli-owned Amos 6 communications satellite already mated to the top of the launcher.

An FAA spokesperson said Friday that federal regulators have signed off on the result of the investigation.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the Amos 6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email to Spaceflight Now. ""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium Next satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

The mission is scheduled to blast off next week from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg with the first 10 satellites for Iridium's upgraded voice and data relay network.

The launch is expected no sooner than Monday at 10:22 a.m. PST (1:22 p.m. EST; 1822 GMT).

SpaceX's launch team conducted a static fire test Thursday - the same type of countdown rehearsal during which the Sept. 1 explosion occurred - with the rocket slated to launch with the Iridium Next satellites.

But Iridium's satellites were not on-board the rocket for the test.

Ground crews planned to install the 10 satellites - built by Thales Alenia Space and Orbital ATK - on the Falcon 9 rocket inside SpaceX's hangar this weekend for a launch attempt next week.

The Sept. 1 mishap was the second Falcon 9 rocket failure, coming about a year after a booster disintegrated in flight with a Dragon supply ship heading for the International Space Station.

Engineers traced the cause of the June 2015 failure to the same second stage helium pressurization system blamed for the Sept. 1 accident.

Investigators concluded a substandard strut holding a helium vessel inside the second stage's liquid oxygen tank failed around two minutes after liftoff from Cape Canaveral. The helium tank broke free, destroying the Falcon 9 rocket and its cargo payload, including a NASA docking port designed to receive new commercial crew capsules at the space station.

SpaceX officials said the helium pressurant will be loaded at warmer temperatures in future countdowns to prevent buckling of the tank's aluminum liner.

The latest version of the Falcon 9 rocket burns super-chilled ""densified"" liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, giving the launcher a performance boost.

The FAA license approved Friday covers all seven Falcon 9 launches planned for the Iridium Next constellation, along with landings of the Falcon 9 first stage on a barge positioned downrange in the Pacific Ocean.

The $3 billion Iridium Next program aims to replace all of the company's existing satellites, which were launched in the late 1990s and early 2000s and are now operating well beyond their design lives.

3G cellular services will be supported by the Iridium Next fleet, which will consist of 81 satellites, including spares.

The operational Iridium constellation requires 66 satellites - 11 spacecraft in six orbital planes - for global coverage serving more than 800,000 subscribers.

The Iridium satellites relay phone calls and messages around the world, bouncing signals from satellite-to-satellite for clients like the U.S. military, maritime and aviation companies, oil and gas operators, and customers in construction, forestry, agriculture and mining."
2435535103,"SpaceX's army of hopers and believers have been holding their breath in anticipation of its next launch. They'll be blue in the face just a bit longer: The liftoff, which had been planned for this Sunday, January 8, has been pushed back a day due to foul weather.

The announcement, until now a rumor circulated in local Central California media, was made official today on the website of Iridium , SpaceX's customer for the launch. This is SpaceX's first launch since a Falcon 9 bearing a $200 million satellite blew up on September 1, 2016. This mission isn't a redo of the last, but the first in a series of seven that will launch a total of 70 miniature telecommunications satellites.

The launch, now scheduled for January 9, 10:22am PST, has been delayed because of foul weather. SpaceX's west coast launch pad is located at Vandenberg Air Force base, in the mountainous shore north of the company's Hawthorne, CA headquarters. Starting Saturday evening, Vandenberg, along with the rest of California, will get drenched by an invisible, incredibly moist tendril of air extending from the tropics. Meteorologists expect the so-called atmospheric river to drop upwards of a foot of rain on low-lying areas. Obviously, not the best conditions to launch a rocket.

Especially a rocket launch that every space junkie on the planet will be watching. Another failure would be very bad for SpaceX, because although the company still has a few years worth of launches on the books, it will have a hard time selling future customers on its safety record with a pair of back-to-back launchpad mishaps. And Musk would be selling his launches against the superior safety records of competitors like United Launch Alliance, Sierra Nevada, and Orbital ATK.

However, none of those other companies are landing their rockets, nor do they have any other clear path towards democratizing access to space. (Yeah, yeah, Blue Origin is landing rockets, but not rockets capable of taking big payloads into high orbits, like the Falcon 9 has done time and again.) Last year, the company landed four of its Cape Canaveral-launched Falcon 9 rockets on a droneship. And another two touched down on dry land. Re-launching Falcon 9s would save SpaceX tens of millions of dollars per launch.

Reusability, along with other pioneering budget-busters like highly compressed propellant, are what SpaceX was banking on in order to fulfill its promise of offering spaceflight to civilians. Elon Musk had been promising the first such re-launch would happen in late 2016. Now ... well, let's just get through Monday.

Or Tuesday, or Wednesday, or whenever California's skies clear up enough for liftoff.

2435593248,"GRAPEVINE, Texas - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has issued a launch license to SpaceX for the upcoming return to flight of its Falcon 9, although its planned launch has been delayed until no earlier than Jan. 14.

FAA spokesman Hank Price said in a Jan. 6 statement that the agency had reviewed and accepted SpaceX's investigation into its Sept. 1 pad explosion. That accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket being prepared for a static fire test in advance of the launch of the Amos-6 communications satellite. With the report accepted, FAA then issued the license required for the launch of the first batch of 10 Iridium Next satellites.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the Amos-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" Price said. ""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium Next satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

SpaceX announced Jan. 2 that it had completed the investigation into the pad explosion, blaming the accident on composite overwrapped pressure vessels used to store helium in the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket's upper stage. The aluminum liner of pressure vessel buckled and liquid oxygen pooled between the liner and carbon overwrap, which led to the failure of the pressure vessel.

At the time of the announcement, SpaceX said it had submitted its report to the FAA, but that the FAA was still reviewing it. Price said Jan. 5 that the FAA was still reviewing the report and continuing to work with the company.

The license, valid until January 2019, covers all seven planned Falcon 9 launches of Iridium spacecraft from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The license also authorizes SpaceX to attempt landings of the rocket's first stage on a ""droneship"" in the Pacific Ocean downrange from the launch site.

The issuance of the license comes a day after SpaceX conduced a static-fire test of the Falcon 9 on the pad at Vandenberg. ""Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week,"" SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted Jan. 5.

When it released the results of its investigation into the September pad explosion Jan. 2, SpaceX stated that it was planning to carry out the launch Jan. 8. An Iridium spokesman said Jan. 6 that the launch has been delayed one day to Jan. 9, at 1:22 p.m. Eastern.

However, Iridium and SpaceX confirmed Jan. 8 that the launch was being delayed until at least Jan. 14 at 12:54 p.m. Eastern because of forecasts of high winds and rain at the launch site. ""Bad weather the cause. Anti-rain dances didn't work - oh well,"" tweeted Iridium Chief Executive Matt Desch Jan. 8.

SpaceX, in its own tweet Jan. 8 announcing the delay, cited ""other range conflicts this week"" at Vandenberg in addition to poor weather for delaying the launch to Jan. 14. The backup launch date is Jan. 15."
2435632296,"SpaceX has the all-clear to return its Falcon 9 rocket to flight next week after a four-month suspension due to a launch-pad explosion.

The go-ahead came in the form of a launch license issued today by the Federal Aviation Administration for SpaceX's launch of 10 advanced Iridium Next telecommunication satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

That launch is currently set for 10:22 a.m. PT Monday, but the timing is dependent on the weather.

Also today, the FAA said it has accepted the results of SpaceX's report on the loss of a Falcon 9 and its Amos-6 satellite payload on Sept. 1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and ""has closed the investigation.""

The Sept. 1 explosion occurred during a fueling test that was being conducted in preparation for liftoff. Earlier this week, SpaceX said it traced the blast to the failure of a helium pressure vessel that was sitting inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen propellant tank.

The company said liquid oxygen apparently pooled up between layers in the lining of the vessel, and reacted explosively with the vessel's carbon composite outer wrapping. SpaceX said it has changed its procedures to head off the problem for future launches.

On Thursday, SpaceX fueled up the Falcon 9 at the Vandenberg launch site and successfully conducted a rehearsal known as a static-fire test. That test undoubtedly provided additional assurance for the FAA as it was preparing to issue the license for next week's launch.

When SpaceX released the findings of its investigation into the Sept. 1 mishap, it said the launch would be scheduled for Sunday. But because of the scheduling for the static-fire test, the timing was pushed back to Monday at the earliest.

Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.

- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 5, 2017"
2435675490,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today ""accepted the investigation report"" regarding the results of SpaceX's investigation into the cause of the company's catastrophic Sept. 1, 2016 launch pad explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket in Florida, and simultaneously ""granted a license"" for the 'Return to Flight' blastoff of the private rocket from California as soon as next week - the FAA confirmed today to Universe Today, Friday, Jan. 6.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" FAA spokesman Hank Price confirmed to Universe Today.

All SpaceX launches were immediately grounded when their Falcon 9 booster and its $200 million AMOS-6 Israeli communications satellite payload were suddenly destroyed without warning during a routine preflight fueling test on Sept. 1, 2016, at pad 40 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

With today's definitive action from the FAA the path is now clear for Hawthorne, Ca based SpaceX to resume launches of the Falcon 9 rocket as soon as Monday, Jan. 9. It will carry a fleet of ten Iridium NEXT mobile voice and data relay satellites to orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Ca, for Iridium Communications.

""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose,"" Price added.

The SpaceX investigation report has not been released at this time.

Liftoff of the SpaceX Falcon 9 with the payload of 10 identical next generation IridiumNEXT communications satellites is slated for 10:22 am PST (1:22 pm EST), Jan. 9, 2017 from Space Launch Complex 4E on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Furthermore all technical systems would appear to be 'GO' for the commercial rocket and commercial payload, following the official announcement by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk that the Falcon 9 rocket successfully passed its normally routine prelaunch static fire test of the first stage engines, on Thursday, Jan. 5.

""Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force completed,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted Jan. 5.

""All systems are go for launch next week.""

""Payload/rocket mating underway,"" Iridium CEO Matt Desch elaborated and confirmed via twitter today.

The static fire test involves briefly firing the first stage Merlin 1D engines for several seconds while the rocket remains anchored to the launch pad. The test is run to confirm that all the engines and rocket systems are technically ready for launch.

In contrast to AMOS-6, the Iridium NEXT payload was not installed atop the rocket this time during Thursday's test to keep them safely and prudently stored out of harms way - just in case another unexpected mishap were to occur.

Members of the Iridium Communications team were on hand to observe Thursday's static fire test first hand.

""With great anticipation, team members observed the static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket that will deliver the first ten Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit. Iridium is excited to share that the test is complete, and that SpaceX is reporting that the rocket should be ready for the first launch of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation next week,"" said Iridium officials.

""The target launch date is now Monday, January 9th at 10:22 am PST, weather permitting.""

And since the launch window is instantaneous, there is no margin for error or delay from either a technical or weather standpoint.

Currently, next weeks weather outlook is not promising with a forecast of rain and clouds on Monday morning and beyond. But only time will tell.

""With completion of the static fire test, our first launch has just gotten that much closer,"" said Matt Desch, chief executive officer at Iridium, in a statement.

""The Iridium team has been anxiously awaiting launch day, and we're now all the more excited to send those first ten Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit.""

""Looks like we're good to go for Monday!"" Desch tweeted today.

""Payload/rocket mating underway; we'll just have to see about the weather. Anti-rain dances, anyone?""

Also known as Iridium 1, this is the first of seven planned Falcon 9 launches to establish the Iridium NEXT constellation - eventually consisting of 81 advanced satellites.

Indeed the FAA license approved today covers all seven launches.

""Space Explorations Technologies is authorized to conduct seven launches of Falcon 9 version 1.2 vehicles from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base with each flight transporting ten Iridium NEXT payloads to low Earth orbit.

The license also allows SpaceX to land the first stage on a droneship at sea in the Pacific Ocean.

After the Sept. 1 accident at pad 40, SpaceX initiated a joint investigation to determine the root cause with the FAA, NASA, the US Air Force and industry experts who have been ""working methodically through an extensive fault tree to investigate all plausible causes.""

On Jan. 2, SpaceX issued a statement ascribing the Sept. 1 anomaly as being traced to a failure wherein one of three high pressure gaseous helium storage tanks located inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank of the Falcon 9 rocket suddenly burst. Helium is used to pressurize the propellant tanks. They provided some but not many technical details.

The failure apparently originated at a point where the helium tank ""buckles"" and accumulates oxygen - ""leading to ignition"" of the highly flammable liquid oxygen propellant in the second stage when it came into contact with carbon fibers covering the helium tank.

The helium tanks - also known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) - are used in both stages of the Falcon 9 to store cold helium which is used to maintain tank pressure.

SpaceX says investigators identified ""an accumulation of super chilled liquid oxygen LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap"" as ""credible causes for the COPV failure.""

Apparently the super chilled LOX or SOX can pool in the buckles and react with carbon fibers in the overwrap - which act as an ignition source. ""Friction ignition"" between the carbon fibers and super chilled oxygen led to the calamitous explosion.

The Sept. 1 calamity was the second Falcon 9 failure within 15 months time and both occurred inside the second stage.

If the Iridium liftoff is successful, SpaceX hopes to resume launches on the Florida Space Coast soon thereafter involving both commercial and NASA payloads using pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.

SpaceX could launch an EchoStar communications satellite later in January and a cargo resupply mission for NASA to the ISS in February from KSC.

Watch this space for continuing updates as SpaceX rolls the rocket out from the processing hangar and we watch the foggy weather forecast with great anticipation !"

The Shield's Up at Nvidia: Santa Clara-based Nvidia has wasted little time during the first week of 2017 picking up where its momentum left off in 2016.

The company, best known for the graphics chips it makes for PCs and gaming devices, hit the stage at the annual CES in Las Vegas and showed off a lot of bells and whistles, including a revamped version of the Shield , its TV and gaming streaming device. And if there were any doubts about Nvidia stating its purpose, it put those feelings to rest with the Shield.

The new Shield is a TV-streaming box with access to Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video and Google Play, and provides online game-playing capability. It also offers users an alternative to the Amazon Echo, as it comes with the voice-activated Google Assistant home-service artificial intelligence technology.

Nvidia also showed off a device called Spot, which is meant to be plugged into power outlets around a home and to act like an extension device that can hear voice commands for the main Shield console.

The Shield comes in two versions, retailing for $199 with 16 gigabytes of storage included, and a $299 Pro model for $299 with 500 gigabytes of storage.

Middle Innings:

Up, Up and (Maybe) Away: When he isn't busy building Tesla cars or turning the lights on at the company's massive battery-making Gigafactory, Elon Musk is looking to the stars with his SpaceX company.

However, SpaceX has been, well, grounded since one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded on the launch pad last September. But the company said it has test-fired the engines on a new rocket and that everything is a go for a launch before the end of the weekend.

The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to sign off on the launch, which SpaceX hopes to do on Sunday. Earlier this week, SpaceX said the explosion of its rocket in September was caused by a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank.

2435770948,"SpaceX is finally, officially, ready to get back into the space launch game after losing one of its Falcon 9 rockets during a massive launch failure last September, which destroyed both the rocket itself and its $50 million payload. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorized the company's Commercial Space Transportation License.

This was the final hurdle SpaceX needed to clear before resuming operations on January 8th. The upcoming launch will (hopefully) see a Falcon 9 version 1.2 launch an Iridium Next satellite into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Should this launch prove successful, the company will be allowed to carry another nine Iridiums into orbit through January 5, 2019. The renewed license is not a blank check for the company by any means. In fact, it demands that ""SpaceX must identify any anomaly occurring on a prior Falcon 9 launch that could be material to public safety.""

SpaceX's investigation into its September failure has concluded that the explosion was caused by super-cooled liquid oxygen leaking into a ""buckle"", or void, between a pressure vessel's liner and its wrapping. As the liquid oxygen built up, it generated friction which, in turn, ignited the fuel and caused the entire rocket to go up in flames. The company has instituted a stopgap measure -- specifically, using a ""proven"" pressure vessel setup that uses warmer helium, thereby reducing the likelihood that the liquid oxygen will detonate -- until it can redesign its vessels to eliminate buckling altogether."

2435955588,"The new year has just begun, and Jeff Bezos' net worth is already up almost $4 billion.

Coming off a difficult three-month stretch in which Amazon lost more than 10% of its value, the company's stock is once again surging. Between Monday morning and Friday afternoon of this week, Amazon's share price rose by nearly 4%, closing at $795.99 per share at the end of normal trading at 4 P.M. EST Friday.

For Bezos, who owns more than 80 million shares and whose personal fortune is almost entirely tied to the business, that increase has led to big personal gains. His net worth jumped $3.8 billion this week to $68.7 billion; on Friday alone his fortune rose by $1.3 billion thanks to a 2% bump in the company's stock price. Bezos is currently the planet's fourth-richest person-trailing only Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega of Spain-according to FORBES' real-time ranking of the world's billionaires.

Amazon's climbing stock can likely be attributed to a combination of factors. Notably, though, the company has received substantial attention this week for its popular Echo device and its accompanying virtual assistant, Alexa. At the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which began Friday, Alexa has been ubiquitous, leading various news outlets to state that Amazon has ""[stolen] the show"" and is ""winning the [virtual assistant] arms race"" against Google and Apple. The recognition is no small feat; CES is the world's largest trade show, with more than 175,000 attendees.

The e-commerce giant has also made headlines of late for its foray into brick-and-mortar retailing, including a small chain of bookstores and a (presently largely promotional) convenience store concept called Amazon Go that will operate without human cashiers. The new ventures come at a particularly interesting time; industry titans like Macy's, Sears and Kohl's have been forced to close scores of outlets, unable to compete with online rivals.

No matter the cause, the company's recent turnaround is certainly a welcome reversal for investors, who have watched its stock decline by roughly 10% since hitting an all-time high in early October. Bezos, who founded Amazon in 1996 soon after quitting his job at a New York hedge fund, is likely also relieved to return public attention to Amazon's products after months of focus on his relationship with Donald Trump, with whom he has previously sparred on Twitter.

In December 2015, following a series of tweets in which Trump accused Amazon of operating as a ""tax shelter,"" Bezos cheekily proposed sending him to space aboard one of his Blue Origin rockets. Should the taunting resume, Bezos may wish to open a new line of attack: that, as of this week, he is worth more than eighteen times as much as the president-elect."
2436002357,"LOS ANGELES - The upcoming Snap IPO stands to break records and make billions for investors, but the company's Southern California neighbors hope it will benefit them in a different way - by shining a spotlight on their flourishing tech industry.

The startup community in the Los Angeles area has already spawned success stories like Oculus VR and Dollar Shave Club . Now one of the year's most anticipated IPO's could be a defining moment for the region as a major tech destination. Venice-based Snap, which reportedly plans to go public with a $25 billion valuation as early as March, would be the biggest offering of a U.S. tech company since Facebook's 2012 debut.

""Snapchat is really the first Silicon Valley-scale company that's been created in the L.A. area,"" said Mitch Lasky, a partner at Menlo Park-based venture capital firm Benchmark, which invested in the company, ""and I think that's going to have profound implications for the future.""

Already executives from Uber and Facebook have defected to Southern California, as Silicon Valley struggles with an exorbitant cost of living and a yawning income gap brought on by fast-growing tech companies competing for highly skilled employees. Several Bay Area startups also have packed up and headed for burgeoning tech hot spots in Los Angeles, Venice and Santa Monica. And industry giants like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Netflix have opened offices in the area - known by some as ""Silicon Beach"" - hoping to capitalize on the region's media and entertainment legacy .

At least by some metrics, Los Angeles already has surpassed the Bay Area in startup activity. In 2016 the City of Angels ranked as the third-most active city in the U.S. for entrepreneurs - beating both San Francisco and San Jose, according to the nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studied new business creation. That represents an upset from the year before, when Los Angeles came in fourth, right behind San Jose. Companies in the LA area pulled in $4.5 billion in funding in 2015 - up 40 percent from 2014, according to the National Venture Capital Association.

""More and more I'm finding companies that I'm excited about investing in that are here,"" said Mike Jones, co-founder and CEO of Santa Monica-based accelerator Science. ""I'm also finding a surprising number of startups that are willing to move here.""

LA-area startups are a unique breed - they tend to focus on content creation instead of gadgets, building services and apps to run on the computers, tablets and smartphones designed by their Silicon Valley neighbors. That's led to a proliferation of Silicon Beach media startups like Fullscreen Media and Zefr, social apps like Snapchat, Tinder and Whisper, and e-commerce companies like Dollar Shave Club and MeUndies.

There's also a thriving virtual reality scene in the area - Oculus VR was based in Irvine before its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook - thanks in part to talent poached from Hollywood's film and special effects industry. And the region houses a niche of next-generation transportation companies like Hyperloop One and Elon Musk's SpaceX that are taking a page from Boeing and other aviation companies with a long history in the region.

Experts agree the SoCal tech scene, which has seen major growth in the past five years, is on the upswing, and a successful public debut from Snap will help recruit tech talent to the region and prevent existing talent from leaving. And when Snap employees cash out after the IPO, they'll have the money to launch their own startups or become angel investors.

Snap is one of several companies that have eschewed Silicon Valley in recent years. Snap's founders, who reportedly dreamed up the idea for their disappearing photo app at a Stanford fraternity house, brought the startup to Venice instead of staying in Palo Alto. Startup Soylent, which makes meal replacement drinks popular with techies, moved from the Bay Area to L.A. shortly after it was founded.

One noteworthy benefit to living down south: ""You're not socked in by fog,"" said Simon Cassels, who surfs every morning before heading into work as chief marketing officer for Santa Monica-based smart doorbell company Ring.

While some Silicon Valley cities attempt to curtail new business development - Palo Alto recently capped construction of new office spaces - Los Angeles is courting tech startups. The city offers some startups free and discounted rent for their first year in downtown Los Angeles and provides tax exemptions for small businesses and companies that recently moved to the city.

In October the city held the grand opening of its La Kretz Innovation Campus, a 60,000-square-foot, $47 million accelerator for cleantech startups in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles.

The district, a gritty, street-art-covered neighborhood of old warehouses on the eastern edge of downtown L.A., is becoming a hot spot for startups such as Hyperloop One, the company building the high-speed transportation tubes first conceptualized by Tesla's Musk. The startup's sprawling industrial complex, which Hyperloop CEO Rob Lloyd described as ""an engineer's dream come true,"" has room for offices, an outdoor space to store segments of prototype tubes, and a lab where engineers test the magnets that will make its passenger pods float as they zip through the tubes. It's the kind of space that's rare - and costly - in Silicon Valley.

""It's easier for us to do that than any company in San Francisco when there's 10 times more people demanding space than available space,"" Lloyd said.

On the western side of Los Angeles, a cluster of abandoned airplane hangars has become a high-tech hub known as Playa Vista. In 2012 YouTube opened its largest ""Space"" campus there - a facility where YouTubers can film using professional equipment - in eccentric aviation billionaire Howard Hughes' former private airport and manufacturing facility.

Other companies followed, gradually transforming the ghost town into a crowded tech campus. Blocks of gleaming office buildings sprang up, as did a beach volleyball court, hammocks and outdoor couches. Now Google reportedly is opening a facility across the street from YouTube, and Facebook, Yahoo and startups Rubicon Project and Fullscreen Media have offices nearby.

""It really feels like this weird 'Truman Show' village,"" said Christopher Webb, CEO of ChowNow, a startup that builds online ordering systems for restaurants. ChowNow moved into Playa Vista almost two years ago, after outgrowing its office in Venice. ""Everything is so clean and new and perfect.""

2436029847,"Airborne drones may soon provide connectivity to remote areas. By Cat DiStasio

The internet is one of the most important inventions of the modern era. However, current estimates say that only 40 percent of people around the globe have access. As internet connectivity becomes ever more important, new technologies are emerging to connect the entire globe with better, faster service. On several continents, research and development projects are underway to provide internet connectivity via high-altitude balloons -- not unlike those used to capture weather data, unmanned solar-powered drones and next-generation wireless routers. Each offers higher speeds and more reliability than current modes, plus the obvious benefit: getting the world online, all at the same time.

Facebook aims for solar-powered internet-beaming drone

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is famous for expressing a desire to connect the entire globe to the internet, and the company wants to launch giant soaring drones to beam out internet access around the world. Facebook's own Connectivity Lab has developed a solar-powered drone with a wingspan as large as that of a Boeing 747. Dubbed Aquila, in June 2016 and, while not equipped with internet technology at the time, the flight was a huge success. The actual flight lasted a whopping 96 minutes (66 minutes longer than planned), and helped the research team tackle the next phase of innovation. Someday, Facebook hopes the highly energy-efficient drones will fly in a 60-mile radius while simultaneously beaming out internet access wherever needed.

MIT's 330 percent faster WiFi

Just a few months ago, researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) announced a breakthrough in new wireless internet that is 330 percent faster and twice the bandwidth of existing technology. Dubbed MegaMIMO 2.0, the technology uses multiple transmitters and receivers to relay data simultaneously, increasing the amount of data in a given bandwidth. This development could someday lead to better, faster internet in public spaces and large gatherings like concerts and sporting events. The new technology could also address the issue of spectrum crunch by distributing data differently so that backups and congestion on the network simply don't occur.

Li-Fi leaves WiFi in the dark?

Last year a French startup developed a wireless internet technology based on LEDs that they claim is 100 times faster than existing WiFi. The so-called ""Li-Fi"" exploits the flicker rate of LED lamps, which is typically imperceptible to the naked eye. That frequency is much higher than the radio waves conventional wireless internet employs. Li-Fi requires light to work, so it can't pass through walls like WiFi, but it can be used to specifically target a specific user. What's more, its secure nature makes it a potential fit in places like hospitals or schools where speed and privacy are high priorities.

Project Loon floats balloon-based internet access

Long before Facebook launched its own drone to beam internet through the sky, Google began Project Loon, a similar initiative that relies on balloons. The high-altitude internet-equipped balloons are designed to spread connectivity in rural parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, plus anywhere else that access is spotty. The project gained traction in 2013 when Google tapped residents of California's Central Valley to volunteer to let the team install an antenna on their home in order to test the beaming balloons. Three years and many tests later on several continents, Project Loon (now operating under X, formerly Google X) continues to perfect its internet-beaming technology in the hopes of someday filling in the empty spots in the data coverage map.During his 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station, American astronaut Scott Kelly became somewhat of an Instagram star, posting jaw-dropping views of the Earth (and beyond) from his outpost in the stars. So, people probably take for granted the notion that astronauts have internet access. In reality, sending data through space is nearly as complicated as space travel itself, but in 2016 that could eventually be used to relay internet service even farther into deep space. If Elon Musk and Richard Branson ever find themselves living on Mars, they'll surely be grateful to the good folks at NASA for making sure they can still tweet from their new homes on the Red Planet.

Samsung's satellite idea

Consumer electronics company Samsung has a big idea for stretching the interwebs around the globe -- using satellites. In 2015, the company floating in low-Earth orbit that could beam up to 1 zettabyte (1 trillion gigabytes) a month. The plan would fly satellites closer to Earth than previous schemes to provide access at speeds internet users are already accustomed to at home. Will Samsung's satellite web ever actually happen? It's not likely, but wild ideas like this keep the conversation going.

2436488174,"SpaceX's first rocket launch since August has been pushed back to January 14th, due to rain and heavy winds that are expected near the launch site in California over the next week. Prior to the delay, SpaceX had been aiming to launch on January 9th, after receiving a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. On Friday, the FAA announced it had accepted SpaceX's explanation for what caused one of the company's Falcon 9 rockets to explode on a Florida launch pad.

SpaceX has been grounded since the accident, which occurred on the morning of September 1st. The Falcon 9 was being fueled in preparation for a pre-flight test, when it exploded in a fireball, destroying both the rocket and the Amos 6 satellite it was supposed to carry into space. The company has spent the past four months trying to figure out what caused the incident, coming to the conclusion that the failure began with helium pressure vessels located in the rocket's upper oxygen tank. Liquid oxygen propellent is thought to have ignited after getting trapped in materials surrounding the helium vessels.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the Amos 6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" the FAA said in an email statement to The Verge on Friday. ""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

Now, SpaceX is looking to return to flight by launching 10 satellites for communications company Iridium, as part of the Iridium NEXT mission. The launch is slated to take place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on January 14th, at 12:54PM ET. Following the flight, SpaceX will try to land the majority of its rocket on one of its drone ships in the Pacific Ocean."
2436495055,"Forecasters predict a rainy, breezy week along California's Central Coast, and the poor weather will keep SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket grounded until at least Jan. 14, officials said Sunday.

Ground crews were connecting the Falcon 9 rocket with a package of 10 Iridium voice and data relay satellites Friday, aiming for a launch opportunity as soon as Monday on SpaceX's first mission since a rocket exploded on its launch pad in Florida in September.

Iridium officials early Sunday confirmed reports that the flight would be delayed to at least Jan. 14 - next Saturday - with an instantaneous launch opportunity at 9:54:34 a.m. PST (12:54:34 p.m. EST; 1754:34 GMT).

""Bad weather the cause,"" Iridium chief executive Matt Desch tweeted Sunday. ""Anti-rain dances didn't work - oh well. Cal needs rain?""

The launch time moves between five and six minutes earlier each day, timed to place the 10 French-designed, U.S.-built Iridium communications craft into one of six orbital planes currently occupied by the company's aging satellites, which launched between 1997 and 2002 and were originally designed to operate only eight years.

The National Weather Service forecast for Vandenberg Air Force Base calls for a chance of rain through Thursday. Breezy conditions are also in the weather outlook.

Vandenberg's range is also booked by United Launch Alliance this week for a countdown rehearsal for an Atlas 5 mission scheduled for launch with a U.S. government intelligence-gathering satellite Jan. 26.

The 229-foot (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will remain in SpaceX's hangar at Space Launch Complex 4-East until technicians roll the launcher to the pad in the final phase of launch preps. The rocket will be erected vertical ahead of the start of the final countdown a few hours before liftoff.

Fueling of the rocket with super-chilled RP-1 kerosene and liquid oxygen will begin around a half-hour before launch, and the Iridium satellites - designed and built by Thales Alenia Space and Orbital ATK - will be switched to internal battery power for the journey into orbit.

SpaceX completed a major preflight test Thursday, filling the Falcon 9 with propellants and helium pressurant on a launch pad for the first time since a rocket exploded at Cape Canaveral on Sept. 1. The ""static fire"" test culminated in the ignition of the first stage's nine Merlin 1D engines for a few seconds, briefly ramping up to full power with 1.7 million pounds of thrust.

A Falcon 9 rocket exploded in the final countdown the last time SpaceX tried a similar static fire test ahead of a planned mission with the Israeli-owned Amos 6 television and Internet communications satellite Sept. 1.

The accident destroyed the Falcon 9 rocket and the Amos 6 spacecraft, and left Cape Canaveral's Complex 40 launch pad with significant damage.

Near-term SpaceX launches from Florida will originate from nearby launch pad 39A, a modified space shuttle launch facility leased from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

Upgrades to pad 39A are nearing completion, SpaceX, with an eye toward the resumption of Falcon 9 fights from Florida as soon as the end of January, assuming preparations go smoothly.

SpaceX investigators determined the explosion was triggered by the sudden failure of a tank of high-pressure helium immersed inside minus 340 degree Fahrenheit (minus 206 degree Celsius) liquid oxygen on the Falcon 9's second stage.

Engineers identified several ""credible causes"" for the failure, SpaceX said, all of which involve super-chilled liquid oxygen - or even frozen oxygen - getting trapped in buckles between the helium tank's aluminum liner and a carbon overwrap. SpaceX said recovered helium tanks - called composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVs - at the launch pad showed buckles in their liners.

""Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled LOX can pool in these buckles under the overwrap,"" SpaceX said in a Jan. 2 statement. ""When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail.""

SpaceX's launch team will load warmer helium pressurant into the rocket to avoid a repeat of the failure, and the company said it intends to change the design of the COPVs in the future to precent buckles altogether.

""The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes,"" SpaceX said. ""In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.""

The Federal Aviation Administration signed off on the SpaceX investigation Friday, granting a license for all seven Falcon 9 launches planned to deploy the bulk of Iridium's next-generation satellite network.

The Iridium Next system, the product of a nearly a decade of development and approximately $3 billion in investment, will replace the company's current satellites providing global voice and data relay services.

SpaceX is under contract to launch at least seven times for the Iridium Next constellation.

Thales Alenia Space and Orbital ATK are manufacturing the 81 Iridium Next satellites in a plant in Gilbert, Arizona. That number includes the 66 operational spacecraft needed to update the Iridium network, plus spares."
2436503156,"The #Mars series featured some wonderful footage of @elonmusk & his @spaceX team watching their successes and failures. Inspiring stuff,"
2436505494,"SpaceX's return to space will have to wait at least another week.

The company had planned to resume liftoffs on Sunday after finishing its investigation into the spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket in September. But inclement weather in California has forced a delay of the rocket's launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base outside of Los Angeles until at least Jan. 14, SpaceX said in a tweet Sunday morning.

The delay comes two days after the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorized SpaceX's Commercial Space Transportation License, allowing it to resume launches. SpaceX launches have been suspended since Sept. 1, when a prelaunch test at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida failed in a massive explosion.

The rocket and its $195 million payload were destroyed, causing heavy damage to Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral.

Like much of the country, California is getting pounded this weekend by extreme weather. Rain and gusty winds are expected to ramp up Sunday, taking aim at California's central coast and the San Francisco Bay Area, the National Weather Service said. Some areas were expected to receive 10 or more inches of rain over the weekend."
2436510095,"NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- SpaceX is pushing back its next rocket launch because of high winds and rain at its launch site in California.

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, which was scheduled to launch Monday, is now set to take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base on January 14, the company said Sunday. The rocket will launch with 10 Iridium NEXT satellites.

The launch will be the company's first since September 1, when its rocket exploded, destroying itself and a pricey Facebook satellite made by Israeli company Spacecom.

Elon Musk's SpaceX previously said that it was ready to launch on Sunday, January 8, but conceded it had not yet received a necessary license from the Federal Aviation Administration.

The FAA granted the license last week, the agency said in a statement Friday.

The launch will once again attempt to take a satellite into space -- 10 satellites, actually.

""The Iridium team has been anxiously awaiting launch day, and we're now all the more excited to send those first ten Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit,"" Iridium CEO Matt Desch said in a statement.

Those satellites are designed to increase the company's speed and bandwidth. Each satellite will also host an aircraft tracking and surveillance system made by flight tracking company Aireon.

After the September explosion, SpaceX, NASA, the FAA, the U.S. Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board launched a probe into the cause of the blast. Last Monday, SpaceX said the investigation had concluded, and blamed a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank for the failure.

The FAA said Friday it ""accepted the investigation report... and has closed the investigation.""

"
2436522094,"SpaceX has been cleared to attempt a Monday launch of a Falcon 9 rocket from California, the company's first in nearly five months.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday confirmed it has accepted the findings of SpaceX's investigation into an explosion that destroyed a rocket and commercial satellite during a Sept. 1 countdown test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and has issued SpaceX a license for the return-to-flight mission.

A Falcon 9 carrying 10 Iridium Communications satellites is targeting liftoff from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 1:22 p.m Eastern Time (10:22 a.m. local time), during an instantaneous window.

But the weather forecast is iffy, with rain expected.

On Thursday, SpaceX fueled the rocket and briefly fired its nine main engines - successfully completing the same type of pre-launch test that was in progress when the September explosion occurred.

""With completion of the static fire test, our first launch has just gotten that much closer,"" said Iridium CEO Matt Desch, in a statement Friday. ""The Iridium team has been anxiously awaiting launch day, and we're now all the more excited to send those first ten Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit.""

The satellites are the first of 70 that SpaceX is contracted to launch for Iridium.

SpaceX on Jan. 2 announced its four-month investigation concluded that the explosion ""likely"" resulted from buckling in tanks that store gaseous helium, which is used to pressurize propellant tanks. Super-chilled liquid oxygen pooled in the buckles between the lining and a composite carbon overwrap covering the tanks, causing friction or breaking carbon fibers that ignited the oxygen.

The company said it would reconfigure its helium tanks and load the gas at a warmer temperature. Longer term, the tanks will be redesigned.

The FAA, NASA, Air Force and National Transportation Safety Board assisted the investigation.

If the next flight goes well, SpaceX hopes to perform its first launch from Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A as soon as Jan. 26, launching a commercial communications satellite. Nearby Launch Complex 40 remains out of commission after the September accident.

That could be followed as soon as Feb. 8 with a launch of cargo to the International Space Station. NASA is conducting its own investigation into SpaceX's accident and expects to review findings with the company this month.

Atlas V assembled for launch

The first rocket slated to launch from Cape Canaveral this year is now standing vertical at Launch Complex 41.

United Launch Alliance on Thursday lifted an Atlas V booster into position inside the Vertical Integration Facility. The rocket's Centaur upper stage followed Friday.

The rocket is scheduled to lift of at 7:46 p.m. Jan. 19, at the opening of a 40-minute window, carrying the third in a series of U.S. missile-warning satellites. The Space-Based Infrared System satellite called SBIRS GEO-3 is bound for a geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles over the equator.

The mission is ULA's first of at least 11 planned in 2017, including seven from the Cape and four from California.

Range forecast for 2017

Air Force Col. Walt Jackim, vice commander of the 45th Space Wing, on Tuesday is expected to present a forecast for local launch activity in the year ahead.

Jackim is the featured speaker at the National Space Club Florida Committee's luncheon meeting at the Radisson Resort at the Port in Cape Canaveral. At the meeting, the club will present its Forrest S. McCartney National Defense Space Award for 2017 to Air Force Capt. Joseph R. Dechert, flight mission lead for the 5th Space Launch Squadron at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Spacewalk on Friday

NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough on Friday is scheduled to perform his second spacewalk in a week outside the International Space Station, aiming to finish installing six new lithium ion batteries.

This time, Kimbrough will team up with Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency, a first-time spacewalker. Kimbrough this past Friday completed his fourth spacewalk, a 6-hour and 32-minute excursion with NASA veteran Peggy Whitson, that started installing plates and hooking up electrical connections for the batteries.

NASA TV coverage begins at 7:05 a.m. Friday.

Moon Express gets funding

Cape Canaveral-based Moon Express this week plans ""a big announcement"" about a new round of financing, CEO Bob Richards said.

Richards disclosed the news Thursday during a Webcast promoting the book ""How to Make a Spaceship"" by Julian Guthrie, about SpaceShipOne's successful 2004 bid to win the $10 million Ansari XPRIZE.

Moon Express is a contender to win the top prize in the $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE, by landing a privately developed robotic lander on the lunar surface. Moon Express hopes to launch its first spacecraft to the moon before the end of the year from New Zealand, on Rocket Lab's new Electron rocket.

"
2436522216,"Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has delayed a planned return to flight for another week owing to bad weather and predictions of continuing storms around a central California launch complex.

The latest schedule calls for blastoff of a Falcon 9 rocket, carrying 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc., from Vandenberg Air Force Base next Saturday morning. The backup date is the following day.

The launch is intended to resume Falcon 9 flights following a nearly five-month-hiatus, stemming from a September explosion during routine ground testing that wrecked a booster, damaged a launch pad and destroyed a $200 million commercial telecommunications satellite.

Next weekend's flight is believed to be carrying the heaviest combined payload lofted into space by Southern California-based SpaceX, as the company is called. Closely held SpaceX is aiming to use the opportunity to reassure commercial and U.S. government customers about the reliability of its rocket fleet.

For Iridium, based in McLean, Va., a successful launch would begin the process of phasing out an aging satellite fleet with more-capable, next-generation spacecraft able to offer additional services. Iridium is operating without necessary in-orbit backups to cope with technical problems potentially experienced by its remaining satellites.

The Federal Aviation Administration at the end of last week granted SpaceX permission to launch after accepting its report about the 2016 accident. The company-led probe, with the participation of government experts, determined that problematic fueling procedures touched off the explosion. Federal laws and regulations give SpaceX the authority to conduct such probes.

Investigators determined the most likely cause was an unexpected interaction between supercooled fuel inside the rocket's upper stage, and part of the composite outside wrapping of a helium tank immersed in that chilled propellant. SpaceX has said it will change fueling practices and eventually, plans a redesign, but hasn't specified what design changes are anticipated.

Iridium, which initially was delayed by manufacturing glitches with its satellites, had been counting on a launch last fall to refresh its orbiting spacecraft. Once the investigation into the September explosion was finished, Iridium announced a mid-December date for liftoff. Then the date slipped to Jan. 8 to allow additional testing.

But with heavy rain and wind gusts of more than 50 miles per hour in the vicinity of the launch pad this weekend, SpaceX opted to shift its sights to next Saturday. Industry officials said both the rocket and the satellites have been tested and are ready for countdown."
2436530079,"SpaceX's much-vaunted return to flight just hit a snag. Iridium has revealed that the Falcon 9 rocket launch has been pushed pack several days to January 14th, at 12:54PM Eastern. Why the long postponement when most delays tend to be a day or two at most? Simply put, the weather at Vandenberg Air Force Base will just be that terrible -- there are ""high winds and rain"" in the forecast for the next several days.

Not that SpaceX or Iridium will necessarily mind. The two want to know that the first Falcon 9 launch since the September explosion will go off without a hitch, both to protect the valuable payload (an Iridium Next satellite) and to show that Elon Musk's private spaceflight plans are back on track. It also gives some extra opportunity to verify the helium loading changes intended to prevent another disaster. Waiting several days will be worthwhile if it sets minds at ease in the long run."
2436532040,"SpaceX has postponed the return to flight for its Falcon 9 rocket until Jan. 14 at the earliest, due to a gloomy weather forecast for the next few days at its California launch site.

The launch of 10 Iridium Next telecommunications satellites had been scheduled for Monday from Vandenberg Air Force Base. But in a series of tweets, Iridium and SpaceX said the liftoff had to be put off due to a combination of windy, rainy weather and scheduling conflicts:

The Federal Aviation Administration gave its clearance for the launch on Friday, after accepting SpaceX's report on last September's failure of a Falcon 9 on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

That rocket and its Amos-6 satellite payload were lost due to a spectacular explosion that occurred while SpaceX was conducting a launch rehearsal.

A months-long investigation determined that the blast was caused by the failure of a helium pressure vessel inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen propellant tank.

SpaceX says it has changed its helium loading procedure to address the issue in the short term, and will redesign the pressure vessels as a longer-term solution.

The company conducted a problem-free rehearsal for the Iridium launch on Thursday.

The delay has caused complications for SpaceX and its customers. It's been five months since the most recent launch of a Falcon 9, and the scheduled payloads - including a cargo shipment to the International Space Station - are stacking up."

SOTO'S DO-NOTHING BILL, Last week:Central Florida Congressman Darren Soto caused a stir saying he plans to sponsor a bill to allow Puerto Rico to vote in presidential elections, a constitutional amendment that will go nowhere, except that it will elevate some people's hope for change before they come crashing down. Talk of political status is the elixir of the Puerto Rican people, a distraction from important tasks at hand, such as the island's economic restructuring, which is sure to be painful. It's cynical for the freshman congressman to rile up people's emotions with a do-nothing bill. No more shots of status elixir for you.

TOO MANY BOWL GAMES. Last week: I realize that this is after the fact but ""What the hell is going on?"" Why do we need what seems like 400 different Bowl Games? A slight exaggeration, perhaps, but true: The Chicken Feet Bowl, The Outrageous Hump Bowl and so on. What happened to the good old days when we actually had bowl games that meant something? Now if your team has a 5-6 record the chances are you will actually get a bowl bid. I demand - did I actually say, demand? Yes! - demand, that we cut out every bowl but 10. I will pick the 10 and you all will surely agree with me.

Passengers presenting a driver's license or identification card from a state where they don't meet the Real ID Act's minimum standards - and where extensions to meet those requirements have not been granted - may be turned away. TSA will accept alternate forms of ID at airports, such as a passport, military ID or permanent resident cards. But next year, driver's licenses and state-issued ID cards from the nine states that don't yet have Real ID-compliant driver's licenses and IDs - Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Washington - won't be accepted

WILL TRUMP DUMP NIXON'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY? Last week: Does the Trump Administration and Republican leadership really want to eviscerate a legacy of President Richard Nixon? Recall that it was during the Nixon Administration that the EPA was established, not to mention the passage of the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts. While some rule changes need to be made, I'm not sure that the Republican leadership wants to make radical changes that would take away important environmental protections, especially those that are so critical for children. Because of the inordinate impact of lead, mercury, pesticides and endocrine disruptors on children, every effort should be made to protect children's environmental health policies.

SEMINOLE COUNTY SECURITY. Last week: We often talk about ""change""; ""the transition of leadership""; or ""the new regime"" - frequently, with hesitation or a sense of fear. The residents of Seminole County are now experiencing a change of leadership, yet none of these phrases are used. After 26 remarkable years as Sheriff, Don Eslinger . is no longer Seminole County's chief law-enforcement officer. With the much-deserving new Sheriff Dennis Lemma in place, there may be only minimal change visible to the public: There will still be a safe community, a well-respected agency, and a leader that the entire Central Florida community should be proud of.

GREAET THINGS HAPPENING IN SEMINOLE COUNTY SCHOOLS. Looking ahead: The Orlando Sentinel has run several stories - from expansion and favorable results in gifted programs to findings that suggest that students are now healthier than years prior - about the tremendous things that happen in Seminole County Public Schools at all levels. Mark my word that we will continue to see innovative projects, increased rates of success, as well as more attention as to ""how they always do it"" throughout 2017.

VOTING RIGHTS FOR EX-FELONS. Looking ahead: It's wrong that in Florida, non-violent felons who have served their sentences aren't allowed to vote. In March, the Florida Supreme Court should allow the ballot measure restoring the voting rights of non-violent, rehabilitated felons to proceed. Efforts must be made to reintegrate ex-felons into society - for all of our benefit. Allowing them to regain their voting rights is not only the right thing to do, it helps prevent reoffending. Did you know that more than 20 percent of our state's African-American population isn't allowed to vote? It's no wonder many black people feel disenfranchised in our society.

The 21-year-old UCF student who also is the youngest ever elected to the Florida House, backed up her campaign promises last week by filing two bills aimed at lessening the financial burden on students attending our public universities. One (HB 153) would change the threshold used for when a surcharge kicks in to a credit hour from 110 percent of credits needed for graduation. It is a small change, but would make a major difference to the students that changed a major or got a little distracted. The second bill (HB 155) would make Bright Futures available for summer credits. Good for her, and Go Knights.

A little sunshine will do this group good. It has a great message to share. Despite some recent questions surrounding the merit of spending tax dollars on tourism marketing, it is difficult for anyone to argue with the results. Tourism, with an emphasis on international tourism, is at an all-time high for Florida. So much so, maybe the agency should change the name to Keep Visiting Florida.

FLORIDA CAN ACHIEVE BOTH GOALS. Last week: As prime legislative sponsor of Florida's Prepaid College program in 1987, I was pleased to learn of Senate President Joe Negron's commitment to higher education funding to retain Florida's best and brightest students. Negron's other big goal is to protect South Florida's economic and environmental viability by cleaning up Lake Okeechobee. House Speaker Richard Corcoran is focused on strong fiscal restraint, particularly in the area of economic incentives. A case can be made that Corcoran's and Negron's goals can both be accomplished by reallocating some of the money that would be spent on economic incentives to higher education and the environment. This way jobs are created not through corporate welfare, but through investing Florida's future work force and preserving Florida's unique environmental resources.

LET EX-FELONS VOTE. Last week: This week the Florida Supreme Court granted a request by a coalition of community leaders, civil rights advocacy groups, clergy and legal professionals to allow oral argument on the court's consideration of a potential - constitutional amendment that would restore voting rights for ex-felons in Florida. Florida's 1.5 million former felons - constituting 10 percent of the state's voting age population - represent the largest conglomeration of legally disenfranchised individuals in the nation. Because of its antiquated system of application for restoration of civil rights, inordinate processing delays, and a politicized nonchalance, these citizens -who are disproportionately young, black and poor - cannot vote or serve on a jury. Hopefully, the court allows the proposed amendment on the ballot in 2018.

FASHION SQUARE ZOMBIE WORLD. Last week: When I ducked into Fashion Square Mall for some last-minute Christmas shopping, I felt like an extra on the set of a zombie movie. Stores, including Sears, were shuttered. Shoppers seemed listless. Owner UP-Fieldgate is behind numerous high-profile local retail projects. But its ambitious four-year plan for Fashion Square, including a new hotel, is floundering. Bancorp foreclosed on a $42 million loan. Opened in 1973, Fashion Square is close to Winter Park, Baldwin Park, Audubon Park and retail-deficient downtown Orlando. It's a potential gem.

She is the spiritual embodiment of our narcissistic President-elect. White's ""prosperity gospel"" teaches that God blesses people by making them wealthy. And like a pitch for Trump University, White says she'll help you obtain the Lord's blessing of riches with a donation to her ministry. White and Trump have much in common. Both are on their third marriage. Both have been investigated for misuse of non-profit funds. Her blonde hair extensions rival his orange pompadour.

TARGET: PLANNED PARENTHOOD. Last week: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced plans to defund Planned Parenthood, cutting off health care for millions of low-income women, men and young people who access quality preventive and basic care like cancer screenings and birth control at hundreds of health centers across the country. Florida politicians tried this same political attack last year and as a federal judge noted, it wasn't constitutional. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be outraged or take action. Defunding Planned Parenthood is dangerous to people's health, it's unpopular, and it would leave people across the country without care. Call your local member of Congress today, and demand that they protect Planned Parenthood.

GUN HEARINGS CANCELED. Looking ahead: Florida legislators will meet in Tallahassee for their first committee week of 2017. Interestingly enough, the Florida Senate canceled several of its meetings, including what was set to be a controversial Judiciary Committee meeting. Chaired by Sen. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota,this committee was set to hear Senate Bill 140, which would allow people with concealed-weapons permits to openly carry handguns in public and also on college campuses. Steube is the sponsor of this bill, too; we must continue to be vigilant to stop bills like this from ever seeing the governor's desk.

TRUMP WON'T FORGET THE FORGOTTEN MAN. Last week: The forgotten man. He is the guy, or gal, who got Barack Obama elected twice, and now Donald Trump. What he needs, desperately, is for the corporate tax rate to move from 35 percent to 10 percent, soon, as Trump promised. Timothy Doescher from The Heritage Foundation tells me that the ""forgetting"" has happened incrementally, as rates crept up over time. ""So what?"" shrug my liberal friends. Just watch. When gobs of capital come gushing back to the states, where it belongs, opportunities for the forgotten man will soar.

Last week: The wounds of 2016 are still healing in Central Florida, which is why the bomb threats that were called in both to the campus where our esteemed Holocaust Center resides and also to the Center for Jewish Life in South Orlando were particular alarming. Many of us hoped to start the new year with a clean slate and renewed optimism; instead, we were confronted with the ""same old, same old"" - grass -oots hate, prejudice and anti-Semitism that has become all too common around the world and right here at home in Orlando. While we grow tired of reading these reports, we must never grow tired of condemning these threats and insisting that Orlando be a safe place for everyone.

LET'S HAVE THE HARD CONVERSATIONS. Looking ahead: I'm a big advocate for dialogue, especially when it comes to the hard issues we face. So I am hopeful that the anti-assault weapons bill that Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith and Sen. Linda Stewart, both of Orlando, introduced will spur exactly that. I know that, with a Republican-controlled Legislature, the bill is a long shot, but we need to talk about this, and I mean real talk. We need to ignore the special-interest groups vying to shape the conversation and think like parents and about our kids. We need to retire phrases like ""slippery slope"" and really consider how we make Florida the best and safest state to live, visit and raise our families.

BOMB THREATS. Last week: The tactics of terrorism continue to be diverse as always and cowardly as history has shown us. Last Wednesday separate bomb threats were called in to two Orlando, Florida area Jewish community institutions. The bomb threats were called in to the Chabad Center for Jewish Life of South Orlando and the Roth Jewish Community Center. It was suggested that the explosive device might be planted in the Holocaust Resource and Education Center that adjoins the JCC, per local media. Police searched both sites but did not find any explosives but the sad part is that hate to continues to thrive in our backyard. Fanaticism remains the greatest carrier of the spores of fear ... education will be the key to destroying terrorism.

ADVICE TO FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS. Last week: The three members of Congress from Orange County were sworn in. All freshmen. All Democrats. With a GOP Congress and White House. And zero seniority. Powerless? Not so fast, my friends. Sure, the chances of their moving any significant legislation in D.C. are virtually nil. However, they could still make a positive difference by focusing on constituent service and placing the majority of their staffs in Orlando as caseworkers as opposed to D.C. legislative staffers. Why? Local folks need help cutting through bureaucratic red tape, including securing VA benefits, expediting passports and helping endangered family members overseas. Godspeed!

END THE SCAM OF RED-LIGHT CAMERAS. Last week: The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles recently released its report on red light cameras for the fiscal year 2015-2016. The statistics are grim. Intersections, where red light cameras are present, received an increase in total crashes. The study proves what I have been saying for years now. Red light cameras are not for safety. Photo enforcement devices are only there as a revenue source. According to the report Rear-end crashes increased by 11.41 percent, and incapacitating injury crashes increased a whopping 26.80 percent. Your elected officials who approve these are scamming you, while putting your life in jeopardy at the same time.

ONE-UPSMANSHIP IN SEMINOLE Looking ahead: In Seminole County, newly elected Tax Collector Joel Greenberg and Clerk of Courts Grant Maloy - stalwarts of fiscal conservatism - usher in a new era as the County Commission is eager to wrestle away some of the checks and balances defined in Florida Statutes for these positions. Already we watched an attempt by some commissioners to limit Greenberg's responsibilities. On the County Commission agenda this week is another ploy by some commissioners to take away the clerk's responsibility to oversee county investments.

ATTEMPT TO GUT ETHICS. Last week: One of the more important stories in America was Congress' closed-door attempt to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. This is a very concerning turn of events that occurred just one day before the swearing-in of the new Congress. As Elizabeth Warren was quoted, ""Who, exactly, thinks that the problem with Washington is that we have too many rules requiring the government to act ethically?"" It is an encouraging sign of things to come that Congress quickly reversed course as a response to not only Trump and Paul Ryan's reprimands, but also to the storm of criticism from American citizens and leaders.

TRUMP-GOP CONGRESS RELATIONS. Looking ahead: Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how Congress' relationship with Trump continues. House Republicans' plan to gut the independent ethics panel was halted by a single tweet from Donald Trump. However, what is more important to note is the content of Trump's tweet. Although the tweet did stop the panel from being gutted, Trump didn't necessarily disagree with the proposed change. His tweet was solely critical of the timing of the action. Moving forward, it's important that the media and citizens truly digest what our president-elect is saying, as he will most likely continue to use social media to sound off on major national issues.

A CHOICE NOT AN ECHO. Last week: One of the most popular gifts this holiday season was the Amazon Echo - selling more than 10,000 units. It is not surprising that tech items topped the list of best sellers, but what is surprising is the superior functionality of the Echo, especially since it is only in its second generation. Echo is voice-controlled and can turn your house into a ""smart home,"" play music, provide news and weather updates, read books or recipes to you, update your shopping list, and even call an ambulance - all by simply saying ""Alexa."" Real-life analogs to famous fictional artificial intelligences, such as Jarvis or Hal, might be only one generation away.

RESOLUTIOINS. Looking ahead: It has been one week since millions of Americans made their New Year's resolutions. In general, most people likely sticking to them. But as time goes on, those resolutions will be tested. Resolutions will be more likely to survive those challenges if resolution-makers measure progress by keeping a journal and remember that progress takes extreme patience. Making impactful life changes takes time and effort. It also takes resilience. If you mess up - and you will - forgive yourself and get back on track. As legendary coach Vince Lombardi teaches us, ""It isn't whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get back up.""

COUNTERTERRORISM FIGHT. Last week: Gov. Rick Scott proposed $5.8 million in funding for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to add 46 counterterrorism agents as part of his 2017-2018 budget. I applaud the Governor for recommending this funding to allow FDLE to work with local, state and federal intelligence agencies to protect Florida from the evil of terrorism. However to curb the senseless violence, the governor and the Florida Legislature need to put a ban on assault-style rifles that are only meant for use by the military, and to require universal background checks to prevent terrorists and mentally ill individuals from acquiring firearms.

IMAGINE CHARLES CANADY ON U.S. SUPREME COURT. Looking ahead: Trump in late September issued a list of 21 potential nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. On that list is Charles Canady who was appointed to the state Supreme Court in 2008. Trump has pledged to appoint a Scalia-like justice who opposes Roe v. Wade. Canady will likely be Trump's choice because he is a religious Republican, and as a former congressman (1993-2001) has a clear record on the issue. He coined the term ""partial-birth abortion"" and in 1995 introduced a bill to ban the practice.

5-CENT INCREASE IN FLORIDA MINIMUM WAGE. Last week: Florida was one of 19 states that recently raised its minimum wage. It may not be much - from $8.05 to $8.10 - but it's a step up from the last two years. And in reality, most entry-level jobs in our region are competing for workers at around $10 per hour (the federal minimum wage is $7.25). We're making progress, but it's crucial this region works together to craft strategies not only to create higher-wage jobs, but to also expand access to education and training to ensure that the local work force has skills to fill these new openings.

ORANGE ECONOMIC SUMMIT. Looking ahead: Mayor Jacobs' Orange County Economic Summit is coming up Jan. 18. This annual event jump-starts the new year with discussions and reviews on Central Florida's continued job growth, economic success, and workforce development. What will the new administration's impact be on the local economy? How can this region cultivate a rich talent supply for growing Central Florida businesses? What is the community doing to make it easier for tech companies to locate and grow in Central Florida, and more importantly, bring and/or create great jobs? The event presents questions and ideas that could have decades of impact on this economy.

JOYSTICKS. Last week: The biggest story over at Bungalower t was about the long-expected opening of Joysticks Arcade and Lounge in Downtown Orlando. The owners are a young couple who made their money doing scenic design and props for the parks as independent contractors. They've hand-made everything in their 1980s-themed bar and created their own little nerd-Narnia on the second floor of a historic building on Pine Street. This is the second big-theme bar for downtown Orlando following the successful opening of the craft-cocktail snow cone serving Frosty's Christmastime Bar on Central.

CAR CULTURE BITES PANERA. Looking ahead: Bungalower recently announced the impending closure of the Lake Eola Panera Bread restaurant. Rumors abound, but company insiders told Bungalower it's because corporate wants all of its locations to have drive-through windows, leading to shaky futures for almost all of Orlando's Panera shops - Park Avenue, Fashion Square Mall, you name it. That one over in Apopka should be just fine though. Who would have thought that 2017 would bring a renewed focus on car culture? Thanks, Trump.

Last week:

Looking ahead: On Jan.21, organized gatherings to support women and their families will take place in Central Florida, Tallahassee and dozens of other cities. In conjunction with the primary Women's March on Washington, each location naturally will have different styles and approaches. The local Women's Rally seems thoughtfully organized, so friends and I will be in Orlando at Lake Eola Park at the Walt Disney Amphitheater that Saturday from 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. This nonpartisan, inclusive gathering of concerned citizens will make its statement about our future as my daughter and nieces are in Washington, D.C., making their statement. http://womensrallycfl.org

BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Last week: The proposed bill by Sen. Linda Stewart and Repr.Carlos Guillermo-Smith banning automatic weapons, as well as large capacity magazines, though a long shot, is a step in the right direction. The current Tallahassee narrative has Sen. Greg Steube permitting the open carry of firearms by some 1.3 million concealed permit holders in airport terminals, college campuses and government meetings. Rep. Scott Plakon's bill provides for open carry, but on college campuses only. This new legislative entry will at least spotlight the more fundamental question: What is better for protecting the public safety - opening wide the doors to the armory or closing them shut?

Last week:

GUN SAFETY. Looking ahead: Again and again, we see how Orlando has risen above tragedy and unified after Pulse. Also affected by gun violence, the community of Pine Hills is organizing to fight the near daily deaths. Our own elected officials, like newly elected Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, are introducing legislation to prioritize gun safety. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is also fighting the gun lobby by pushing back against its attack on local control. Could Florida's recent experiences force gun policy changes this year? For my life and yours, I hope so.


Nick Primrose, lawyer and president of the Orange County Young Republicans

WHY DO DEMINGS, SINGH AND RANDOLPH PERSIST? Last week: On Tuesday, a nonpartisan Judge issued a temporary stay to the recently passed Charter Amendment making six county offices nonpartisan. The lawsuit was filed just days before Christmas by a newly formed nonprofit run by Sheriff Jerry Demings, Property Appraiser Rick Singh and Tax Collector Scott Randolph. In an interview aired days prior, Singh called his re-election, ""a mandate of the people"" and also admitted there is no Republican or Democrat way to run the property appraiser's office. This is the second time Orange County voters overwhelming approved nonpartisan offices, so it begs the questions about why these officers want to invalidate the voters' will.

MAKING FLORIDA RED AGAIN. Looking ahead: This week brings an exciting time for Republicans locally and across the state. On Thursday, the Orange County Young Republicans hold its annual meeting and elections. The Executive Board slate was nominated unopposed and will host some big events this year in Orange County. On Friday and Saturday, the Republican Party of Florida will have its Annual Meeting in Orlando, like re-electing Chairman Blaise Ingoglia. Simultaneously, the hardworking Florida College Republicans will have their Winter Quarterly meeting. These organization are already busy preparing for the important gubernatorial and midterm elections in 2018, while sneaking in some time to celebrate Making Florida Red Again.


Joanie Holzer Schirm, author; former president of Geotech

PUTNAM AND PRUITT - WHAT A PAIR. Last week: Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam says Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general and close ally of the fossil-fuel industry, is a great pick to run our U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Filled with expert scientists, this agency shouldn't be climate-change deniers. Pruitt coordinated a legal effort to fight President Obama's efforts to tackle climate change. EPA regulations force power plants to significantly reduce their emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution. Now it's possible for a legally experienced EPA director to substantially weaken this progress. Putnam claims if we get rid of regulations we will save enough money to ""buy 300 stealth bombers and 2,000 military tanks."" Not the spending priority I'd choose for my grandchildren's America.

POPULAR VOTE. Looking ahead: Want your vote to really count? Antiquated Electoral College rules must be updated. The winner-take-all laws that award all of the state's Electoral votes to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state violate fundamental principles of representative democracy: ""one person, one vote."" To fix this, Florida state Sen. Darryl Rouson filed legislation to include Florida in a national movement that recognizes the U.S. Constitution gave state legislatures the authority to decide how their electors are chosen. Eleven states including California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington signed the National Popular Vote Interstate compact to elect the president by popular vote eliminating the Electoral College's disruptive role.

DE-ESCALATE VIOLENCE. Last week: Bomb threats called into two area Jewish centers last Wednesday are a disturbing sign of our times. While the calls turned out to be empty threats, the impact on the centers' children, parents, and staff cannot be dismissed. These acts are intended to cause disruption both physical and emotional. They have no place in our community or in any community. While this kind of emotional harassment is not new, there was a dramatic uptick in biased based incidents following the November election, primarily anti-immigrant, anti-black, anti-Muslim, and anti-LGBT (per The Southern Poverty Law Center). Violence breeds violence. We must de-escalate.

MARTIN LUTHER KING CELEBRATIONS. Looking ahead: Orlando kicks off its series of celebrations of the life and legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. today with its annual MLK Candlelight Vigil and Interfaith Service. Open to all, the event begins at Orlando City Hall at 6 p.m. After opening remarks, those gathered will join civic and religious leaders in processing to First Presbyterian Church for the city's annual MLK Interfaith and Multicultural Service. The theme of the evening draws on King's reminder that ""We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."" It's a beautiful event for all ages.

TRAGEDY IN TURKEY. Last week: I watched in horror as news and images came in from the horrific and deadly shooting which took place in Istanbul, Turkey, on New Year's Eve. That more lives have been lost in the midst of what was supposed to be a joyous moment, one that was being celebrated with song and dance, is sad beyond words. It strikes even closer to home for us as we recently marked 6 months since Pulse and here we are starting a new year with grief. May 2017 be a source of comfort and consolation for all those who mourn around the world.

TOGETHER WE MUST ACT. Looking ahead: With the bomb threats to two Jewish institutions this past week - the Jewish Academy of Orlando and the Chabad of South Orlando (where my daughter goes to school) - we will need to decide as a community, city, state, country and world how we will combat acts of hate and violence against people of all faiths. Yes, this was a threat against the Jewish community in particular, but we all know that such threats exist every day against our brothers and sisters of other traditions and beliefs. Taking on this hatred is done together, not as individuals. Together we must act.


Michael Slaymaker, professional fundraising executive

PULSE AT THE ROSE BOWL PARADE. Last week: The Rose Bowl Parade float honoring the victims of the Pulse shooting was a lovely tribute. Thank you to the AIDS Health Foundation for sponsoring the float. It was wise to keep the tragedy at Pulse in front of the nation. It is good for the survivors to know millions of people are sending healing thoughts and prayers. It is good to help remind the nation that we need gun laws that truly reflect the will of the people. It is good that Orlando is honored for our response.

Looking ahead: Childhood is meant to learn not to earn. Jan. 11 is Human Trafficking Awareness Day. With 21 million victims worldwide, there are more slaves today than at any time in history. Human trafficking is forced labor, domestic servitude or sexual exploitation using force, fraud and/or coercion. The Greater Orlando Human Trafficking Task Force hotline received nearly 1,000 calls last year. The State of Florida passed the Safe Harbor Act which was a big help for law enforcement. Please be aware the problem is real and happening in our back yard at an alarming rate. No child should ever be exploited.

HOW LONG TO HATCH A DINOSAUR EGG? Last week: A human typically gives birth after nine months. An ostrich hatchling emerges from its egg after 42 days. But how long did it take for a baby dinosaur to incubate. Groundbreaking research led by a Florida State University professor establishes a timeline of anywhere from three to six months depending on the dinosaur.

SPACEX RESUMES LAUNCHES. Looking ahead: SpaceX plans to resume flights this week after finding the cause of an explosion that destroyed a rocket and satellite on a Florida launchpad in September. The company said its investigation of the Sept. 1 explosion found that a tank failed within the larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank. Best wishes to Elon Musk and company on the launches.

THE HEARTBREAK OF HIGH RENTS. Last week: My heart sank when I learned last week that apartment rents are rising at twice the rate in Orlando as the rest of the United States, rising roughly eight percent in just the past twelve months alone with no sign of the trend abating. Yes, this is good news for all those investors and contractors building new apartments all over Central Florida, but if we don't start building affordable housing at the same time, we are simply adding to our homeless population because low wages and costly transportation put housing out of reach for many families. Build, but let's build wisely with the whole community in mind.

Looking ahead:

HIGH-SPEED RAIL. Looking ahead: As we wrap up a successful bowl season in Orlando and I look forward to the College Football National Championship game in Tampa on Monday night, I can't help but think of the convenience and connectivity that high-speed rail would have provided. Mayor Buddy Dyer recently said that his biggest frustration in office was the inability to get the state and other necessary stakeholders on board with high-speed rail. I share his disappointment. This link would have presented the Orlando/Tampa area as one destination and made it an impactful ""Super Region."" Big events, like the Championship game or upcoming NFL Pro-Bowl, would be accessible to a wider audience and the economic impacts would have a much bigger multiplier effect. I hope we continue to push for a high-speed rail connection between Orlando and Tampa, coupled with a wider variety of other mass-transit options.

Last week: Our first FilmSlam screening of 2017 is tonight for this independent, Florida filmmaker-screening series. Last year we broke attendance and local submissions records, and celebrated several firsts including an all-female program (affectionately called ""FemmeSlam""). in May, a love-themed February, and horror-themed October. In June, I had the solemn task of hosting FilmSlam just hours after the Pulse massacre, and in July we showed our community pride with our first-ever color logo in honor of the fallen. I am excited to see where FilmSlam goes next, and I invite all of you to join me in support local film at Enzian Theater.

CONSUMER ELECTRONIC MARVELS. Looking ahead: CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, ended last weekend, and it was all about Augmented and Virtual Reality tech which may bring some exciting tech to Central Florida, particularly in the tourism sector. Having covered CES for several years, I have the privilege of previewing gadgets way before release. Some go to market, others stay a dream but one thing's for sure - you'll always see something interesting at CES. Among those this year: hands-free breast pumps, Lego robots, smart appliances, tech personalization in attractions and vacations, autonomous transportation, paper thin OLED displays with 8k resolution... the future is NOW!"

(Reuters) - A powerful storm lashed California and other parts of the western United States on Sunday, bringing flooding and the risk of dangerous mudslides to a state that has struggled with drought for years.

As of late morning, the storm was dumping between one-half and three-quarters of an inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) of rain per hour in parts of California and was set to continue for several hours, according to meteorologist Kenny James of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

In Oregon and parts of Washington State and Idaho, the storm was expected to bring ice through this evening, creating hazardous conditions.

James said the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California could get 3 to 7 feet (0.9 to 2.1 meters) of snow by Monday.

In northern California, officials reported power outages and roads closed due to overflowing rivers. An ""extreme"" avalanche warning was issued for the Sierra Nevada range, which runs through the central and eastern part of the state.

The National Park Service said all roads to the valley in Yosemite National Park were closed because of expected flooding.

In Oregon, a men's basketball game between Gonzaga University and the University of Portland scheduled for Saturday night was postponed indefinitely, while the National Basketball Association's Portland Trailblazers postponed a home game against the Detroit Pistons from Saturday night to Sunday evening.

Iridium Communications said Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company had delayed Monday's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 of its satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base, located north of Los Angeles.

The flight, which will be SpaceX's first since a launch pad explosion in Florida four months ago, is now targeted for 9:54 a.m. PST/17:54 p.m. GMT on Saturday.

The storm is drawing its strength from the interaction between an ""atmospheric river,"" a long plume of water vapor flowing from the tropics toward the West Coast, and a low-pressure area near Oregon, according to James.

After years of drought, the storm is the latest incident in a strong wet season for California that began in the fall. Another front is expected to move into the area on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the eastern United States experienced cold temperatures on Sunday, the day after a massive storm dumped snow from Georgia to Massachusetts, causing hundreds of car accidents and knocking out power to thousands of people.

2436606183,"In the face of unrelenting days of very poor weather and a range conflict with another very critical rocket launch, SpaceX is pushing back the return debut of their private Falcon 9 rocket carrying a revolutionary fleet of voice and data commercial communications relay satellites for Iridium to no earlier than next weekend, Jan 14.

Earlier indications of a nearly weeks long launch delay from Monday, Jan. 9 to next Saturday morning, Jan. 14, were officially confirmed today, Jan. 8, by SpaceX and their Iridium Communications customer.

""Launch moving due to high winds and rains at Vandenberg,"" SpaceX announced today, Jan. 8.

Liftoff of the SpaceX Falcon 9 with the payload of 10 identical next generation Iridium NEXT communications satellites had been slated for 10:22 am PST (1:22 pm EST), Jan. 9, 2017 from Space Launch Complex 4E on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

The advanced next satellites will start the process of replacing an aging Iridium fleet in orbit for nearly two decades.

And it was less than 48 hours ago on Friday, Jan. 6, that the FAA finally granted SpaceX a license to launch the 'Return to Flight' Falcon 9 mission - as I confirmed with the FAA here.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" FAA spokesman Hank Price confirmed to Universe Today.

""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

The SpaceX investigation report into the total loss of the Falcon 9 rocket and AMOS-6 payload has not been released at this time. The FAA has oversight responsibility to encourage, facilitate, and promote U.S. commercial space transportation and ensure the protection of public safety.

The private rocket - developed by CEO Elon Musk and his company - has been grounded for four months since a catastrophic launch pad explosion last September suddenly destroyed another Falcon 9 and its $200 million Israeli owned satellite during a prelaunch fueling test on the Florida Space Coast.

The Sept. 1, 2016 calamity was the second Falcon 9 failure within 15 months time. Both occurred inside the second stage and called into question the rockets reliability.

The prognosis of a week of bad California weather had been known for some time and finally prompted an official announcement just 24 hours before the hoped for launch.

""With high winds and rain in the forecast at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the first launch of 10 Iridium NEXT satellites is now planned for January 14th at 9:54:34 am PST with a back-up date of January 15th,"" Iridium officials elaborated in a statement.

The mission, known as Iridium 1, has an instantaneous launch opportunity at 9:54:34 a.m. PST (12:54:34 p.m. EST).

Next Sunday, Jan. 15 is available as a back-up launch opportunity in case of a delay for any reason including technical and weather related issues.

Furthermore, humorous pleas by Iridium CEO Matt Desch for divine intervention went unheeded !

""Can now confirm: new launch date Jan 14 at 9:54am pst. Bad weather the cause. Anti-rain dances didn't work - oh well. Cal needs rain?"" said Iridium CEO Matt Desch when he threw in the towel this morning by tweet.

Things change fast and furious in the rocket business, and flexibility is the name of the game if you want to survive the frequently changing landscape.

A contributing factor to the delay is a range conflict with an upcoming Atlas rocket launch for the U.S National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) at Vandenberg AFB.

""Other range conflicts this week results in next available launch date being Jan 14,"" SpaceX confirmed.

The United Launch Alliance Atlas V is scheduled to launch the super secret NROL-79 spy satellite for the NRO on Jan. 26.

Prior to the launch, ULA must conduct a wet dress rehearsal (WDR) of the Atlas V by fueling it with propellants to confirm its readiness to launch.

The clandestine NROL-79 intelligence-gathering payload is critical to US national defense. Surly it was manufactured over a time span of several years at an unknown classified cost probably amounting to billions of dollars.

For the Iridium - 1 mission the 229-foot (70-meter) Falcon 9 will carry a fleet of ten Iridium NEXT mobile voice and data relay satellites to orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Ca, for Iridium Communications.

Iridium 1 is the first of seven planned Falcon 9 launches to establish the Iridium NEXT constellation which will eventually consist of 81 advanced satellites.

The FAA license approved on Jan. 6 covers all seven launches.

""Space Explorations Technologies is authorized to conduct seven launches of Falcon 9 version 1.2 vehicles from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base with each flight transporting ten Iridium NEXT payloads to low Earth orbit.

The license also allows SpaceX to land the first stage on a droneship at sea in the Pacific Ocean.

So besides the launch, SpaceX plans to continue its secondary objective of recovering the Falcon 9 first stage via a propulsive soft landing - as done several times previously and witnessed by this author.

The Iridium-1 mission patch featured herein highlights both the launch and landing objectives.

The goal is to eventually recycle and reuse the first stage - and thereby dramatically slash launch costs per Musk's vision.

This Falcon 9 has been outfitted with four landing lags and grid fins for a controlled landing on a tiny barge prepositioned in the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles off the west coast of California.

Desch says that all seven of his Falcon's will be new - not reused.

""All our seven F9s are new,"" Desch tweeted.

On Jan. 2, SpaceX issued a statement ascribing the Sept. 1, 2016 AMOS-6 launch pad anomaly as being traced to a failure wherein one of three high pressure helium storage tanks located inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank of the Falcon 9 rocket suddenly burst. Cold helium is used to pressurize the propellant tanks. They provided some but not many technical details.

The failure apparently originated at a point where the helium tank ""buckles"" and accumulates oxygen - ""leading to ignition"" of the highly flammable superchilled oxygen propellant in the second stage when it came into contact with carbon fibers covering the helium tanks - also known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs).

""Friction ignition"" between the carbon fibers acting as a friction source and super chilled oxygen led to the calamitous explosion, SpaceX concluded was the most likely cause of the disaster.

Watch this space for continuing updates as SpaceX rolls the rocket out from the processing hangar and we watch the saga of the foggy weather forecast with great anticipation !"
2436692823,"Washington (AFP) - Bad weather has postponed SpaceX's plan to resume flights of its Falcon 9 rocket until at least January 14, the California-based private space firm said.

SpaceX had planned a launch on Monday of 10 Iridium NEXT communications satellites from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

""Launch moving due to high winds and rains at Vandenberg. Other range conflicts this week results in next available launch date being January 14th,"" SpaceX said on Twitter on Sunday.

An unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded September 1 in Cape Canaveral, destroying a satellite that Facebook planned to use to beam high-speed internet to Africa.

That marked a setback for the company and its founder Elon Musk, who wants to revolutionize the launch industry by making rocket components reusable.

That accident -- the second of its kind since SpaceX was founded in 2002 -- came just over a year after a Falcon 9 rocket failed after liftoff on June 28, 2015, destroying a Dragon cargo capsule bound for the International Space Station.

Before that, SpaceX had logged 18 successful launches of the Falcon 9 -- including six of 12 planned supply missions to the ISS carried out as part of a $1.6 billion contract with NASA.

SpaceX had hoped to resume Falcon 9 flights as early as November, then in mid-December, before pushing the date to January.

2436699709,"ANTHONY MASON: Time now for Morning Rounds with CBS News chief medical correspondent Doctor Jon LaPook and CBS News contributor Doctor Tara Narula. First up, peanut allergies. According to the CDC, just eight foods or food groups make up ninety percent of all serious allergic reactions in the U.S. and peanuts are one of them.

DANA JACOBSON: This week the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases published guidelines on how to prevent peanut allergies in children. Jon, had a look.

(Begin VT)

DR. JON LAPOOK: Four-and-a-half-year-old twins Audrea and Izza (ph) share everything--everything that is, except Izza`s severe peanut allergy. When Izza was diagnosed as a baby, her mother Chai Kuo (ph) was given traditional guidance.

CHAI KUO: No ingestion at all of peanuts and no contact either because she had a contact allergy where if she so much as even touch peanut, she would break out into hives everywhere.

DR. JON LAPOOK: But when Izza`s brother Ander was born last year at high risk for peanut allergy, the plan was reversed. Chai was told to feed him diluted peanut butter on a regular basis starting at four months to avoid developing an allergy.

CHAI KUO: He`s been able to have it three or four times a week at home with no adverse reactions. So it`s a big sigh of relief for-- for all of us.

DR. HUGH SAMPSON: Now, we`re saying not only it`s okay. We`re saying, go do it.

DR. JON LAPOOK: Doctor Hugh Sampson of Mount Sinai Hospital helped write the new guidelines.

DR. HUGH SAMPSON: In these high-risk children we need to get peanut into their diet early to try to prevent peanut allergy.

DR. JON LAPOOK: The guidelines categorize high-risk babies as those with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. Introducing peanut protein is now recommended as early as four months old. This regimen lowers the odds of developing peanut allergy by at least seventy percent, leading to the new guidelines.

DR. HUGH SAMPSON: I wish something like this would cure peanut allergy, but, you know, it`s unlikely. I think we can significantly reduce the amount of peanut allergy.

(End VT)

ANTHONY MASON: Jon, do these new guidelines surprise you? Because I think for a lot of people four months seems really early.

DR. JON LAPOOK (CBS News Chief Medical Correspondent): Well, they surprised me two years ago when the study came out showing this, so I was expecting these guidelines and it shows you why you need to do these studies. But I want to bring up something that`s been of concern to me the last few days. You`ve been seeing these headlines that have been talking about giving peanuts to kids and even pictures of bowls--

DANA JACOBSON: Right.

DR. JON LAPOOK: --of peanuts. Peanuts are a choking hazard--

ANTHONY MASON: Yes.

DR. JON LAPOOK: --especially for babies, for infants, and for young kids, and so that`s why the guidelines take special care right--

DANA JACOBSON: Yeah.

DR. JON LAPOOK: --to talk about how to give it safely. You take maybe peanut butter and give hot water.

DR. TARA NARULA (CBS News Medical Contributor): You have to thin it out.

DR. JON LAPOOK: Thin it out, give a slurry. So I-- I really think that`s important. I don`t want people out there, especially young parents who-- who maybe don`t know any better to-- to do something that`s wrong.

DANA JACOBSOsN: Just handover a peanut. What about other food groups, Tara? I mean could they expand this to approach allergies with those?

DR. TARA NARULA: So food allergies are a big problem. They affect four to six percent of kids in America. They result in hundreds of thousands of ER visits. There`s no cure. So being able to find a way to prevent these allergies would be a big deal and there are only about eight foods that are a cause of ninety percent of food allergies.

DANA JACOBSON: Oh, wow.

DR. TARA NARULA: So, theoretically, it makes sense that you could do the same thing with other foods that they`re doing with peanuts, which is, basically, introduce it into the immune system early, early on in life at a time where you can retrain, recondition the body to react in a different way to these allergenic proteins. They`re doing this already with egg and milk. So far the egg studies have been small and they`ve had conflicting results. Some have shown benefit with early introduction. Some haven`t. Some of the researchers are saying that maybe we need to introduce those two things, even earlier than four to six months to really see it benefit.

ANTHONY MASON: Oh.

DR. TARA NARULA: So the-- the bottom line is we need a lot more research into this, but definitely opens up the door to that possibility.

DANA JACOBSON: It could make life a lot easier for young kids in schools where they have all the-- the bans on bringing any kind of peanut product in there if they could change things like that.

We move on to the next topic, which is the incidence of cancer. This week the American Cancer Society put out new estimates for the year 2017 using data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The report estimates that this year there will be over 1.6 million new cancer cases and over six hundred thousand deaths. But in a positive trend the report did find that from 1991 to 2014 the overall cancer death rate dropped by twenty-five percent. Tara, were-- were there differences in these statistics when it came to men versus women?

DR. TARA NARULA: There were. So-- so let`s talk first about the similarities, right? They`re the top four--lung, colon, prostate, and breast. These are really the ones that most affect, you know, the biggest killers of men and women. But there is a disparity there, and that comes in the fact that men are affected or have a higher incidence of cancer in general. Twenty percent higher incidence than women do. They have a forty percent higher mortality rate than women do. And there are differential reasons why this might be. First of all, men are more affected, for instance, by liver cancer. That happens to be a very fatal type of cancer.

ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm.

DR. TARA NARULA: There are other cancers that more often affect men and can be more deadly for men--esophageal, laryngeal, bladder, and melanoma. Some of the reasons why we might see this difference in addition to some cancers being more fatal are differential exposure to environmental risk factors or things like smoking or alcohol, which many men may do in more excess than women and can contribute to certain types of cancers. There may be hormonal differences and even things like height have been shown to influence--

DANA JACOBSON: Wow.

DR. TARA NARULA: --the development of cancer.

ANTHONY MASON: Jon, what-- what about other demographics?

DR. JON LAPOOK: Well, in 2014 the cancer death rate was fifteen percent higher in blacks than in whites.

ANTHONY MASON: Mm-Hm. Mm-Hm.

DR. JON LAPOOK: And we`ve seen this kind of disparity for years. We know for-- I`m a gastroenterologist. We know, for example, with colon cancer. Colon cancer tends to affect blacks at a earlier age and when it affects them, it`s more aggressive. We know that the most deadly form of breast cancer triple negative affects black women higher than other groups. So this is something that we`ve known about for years and we`ve thought we need to do something about that. Now there are a number of factors, maybe genetics, environment, and then, of course, access to care. The good news since the Affordable Care Act was from 2010 to 2015, the percentage of uninsured blacks went in-- was cut in half from twenty-one percent to eleven percent. The problem right now is with the threatening of the Affordable Care Act is that going to change and maybe not give you the opportunity to make some changes.

DANA JACOBSON: Some of those are things we know. Were there any things in these statistics that might surprise people?

DR. TARA NARULA: There were a couple of things. So, first of all, cervical cancer was the second leading cause of cancer death in women ages twenty to thirty-nine. And that doesn`t have to be the case. If there`s better screening, if there`s more acceptance in use of the HPV vaccine, that could change. We know that in 2014 only forty percent of girls ages thirteen to seventeen got the HPV vaccine. Other things that stood out, there was a big geographical differences. So heart disease is leading cause of death in this country, but in twenty-one states cancer is the leading cause of death. And when you compare states, Kentucky had three and a half times the rate of lung cancer due to higher smoking than Utah.

DANA JACOBSON: Right. Right.

DR. TARA NARULA: And, finally, there are cancers that are on the rise like liver cancer and uterine cancer.

DANA JACOBSON: All right. Great information for all of us. Doctors Jon LaPook and Tara Narula, thank you very much.

2436699712,"DANA JACOBSON: Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING: SATURDAY. We begin this half hour with the death of Tilikum, the SeaWorld orca best known for killing a trainer and inspiring the documentary Blackfish, died yesterday at SeaWorld Orlando after a yearlong illness.

ANTHONY MASON: The highly publicized death of that trainer changed the future of orcas at SeaWorld. On Sunday, SeaWorld San Diego will bring its theatrical orca show to a close after years of criticism and controversy. Carter Evans has more.

(Begin VT)

CARTER EVANS: For years the killer whale known as Tilikum was the star of the show at SeaWorld.

WOMAN: I think he spent a lot of time in isolation.

CARTER EVANS: He was also the star of the controversial film Blackfish--

(Excerpt from Blackfish)

CARTER EVANS: --after Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau in front of an audience at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010.

MAN #1: In the end, you know, he basically just completely mutilated that poor girl.

CARTER EVANS: After Blackfish debuted in 2013 SeaWorld faced a backlash and saw a decline in its attendance and revenue.

MAN #2: There you go.

CARTER EVANS: Tilikum continued to perform until about two months ago but the performances changed dramatically. Trainers are no longer allowed to swim with the whales. And just this week SeaWorld said the theatrical orca shows will soon be replaced by an educational presentation in a more natural setting, according to SeaWorld Vice President Brian Morrow.

Critics are saying this is just a facelift.

BRIAN MORROW: Is it in the same theater as it was before? Yes. It`s in the same space but the experience and the subject matter and the behaviors and the things you`ll see the whales doing that`s all changing.

CARTER EVANS: SeaWorld declined to comment on camera about Tilikum`s death. Marine mammal scientist Naomi Rose says captive whales can face health challenges.

NAOMI ROSE: These animals are confined in such a small space and in such artificial social groupings, that kind of stress makes it more difficult for them to fight off diseases.

CARTER EVANS: Tilikum had been battling a respiratory infection for several months. SeaWorld believes the thirty-six-year-old orca succumbed to that infection despite receiving what they say was the best medical care possible.

2436765404,"If we promise Humpty Dumpty he will be President of all of Mars & not only the US, can we convince him to go on that SpaceX mission?"
2436802623,"(Reuters) - Forecasters expect another half foot of rain to soak central and northern California and the Sierra Nevada mountains through early Tuesday, coming on the heels of powerful storms that walloped the state and other parts of the U.S. west on Sunday.

The drenching rains and blowing snow flooded rivers and shut down roads from mudslides in a state that has struggled with drought for years.

From 3 to 8 inches (7.6 to 20 cm) of rain is forecast in the region while several feet (1-2 metres) of snow are likely for higher elevations, said meteorologist Andrew Orrison at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

""We're going to see heavy rain going into (Monday) evening and early morning,"" he said.

Heavy snow is expected in Nevada and the northern Rocky Mountains could get several feet of snow over the next day or two.

The weather service said almost 40 rivers or creeks in Northern California and western Nevada were flooded or threatened to top their banks. But an emergency agency spokesman said there had been no reports of fatalities or serious damage.

Authorities said a section of Interstate 80 near Truckee, southwest of Reno, Nevada, was closed by a mudslide.

The upper Napa River north of San Francisco was expected to cause ""extreme damage to all towns along the reach,"" the California emergency agency said in a statement. Anticipated flooding brought voluntary evacuations in neighboring Sonoma County.

Residents of Cambria, near the famous Hearst Castle along California's central coast, were advised to move to higher ground due a flash flood warning.

Several other California highways were closed from landslides or high water. In Washington state, high winds, ice and heavy snow shut roads and created hazardous driving conditions.

Iridium Communications said Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company had delayed Monday's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 of its satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles. The launch was now set for Saturday.

The storm is drawing strength from the interaction between an ""atmospheric river,"" a plume of water vapor flowing from the tropics toward the West Coast, and a low-pressure area near Oregon, the National Weather Service said.

After years of drought, the storm is the latest in a strong wet season for California that began in the autumn. Another front is expected on Tuesday.

In an encouraging sign, the U.S. Forest Service said the rain had restored moisture levels in Southern California vegetation to a seasonal normal for the first time in five years.

The eastern United States experienced low temperatures on Sunday, the day after a massive storm dumped snow from Georgia to Massachusetts.

2436996784,"A host of new developments are on the horizon for Titusville as the town continues to bounce back.

Big job announcements highlighted Titusville's 2016, with Embraer, OneWeb, Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin all announcing expansion efforts that would positively affect the city. The town also moved forward with its Titus Landing shopping complex and the opening of a Hobby Lobby.

The new year, however, will welcome even more additions as businesses continue to pop up in the North Brevard city. A new hotel, restaurants, an apartment complex and retailers all make up the list of new additions coming to the area.

Here's a breakdown of what's in the works, according to the city's economic development team:

• Marriott. Plans for a new 15,230-square-foot Marriott Hotel are underway for a location on Helen Houser Boulevard near the I-95 exit at State Road 50. The area is already a small hub for Titusville hotels, nestled near the Cracker Barrel restaurant. This hotel, however, will be located south of Cheney Highway, city documents state. A tentative opening and the start of construction has not yet been announced. Site plans are still under review.

• Cumberland Farms. Cumberland Farms will take over the corner of State Road 50 and U.S. Highway 1, where a now-empty gas station sits. Site and building plans are still under review and construction has not yet begun.

• Bagel 13. Bagel 13 will open a second Titusville location at the corner of State Road 50 (Cheney Highway) and Apollo Road. The fast-casual restaurant specializes in bagels, bagel sandwiches, salads, wraps and coffee. The new store has plans to open March 1. Bagel 13 currently has four open locations: Rockledge, Cocoa Beach, Melbourne and Titusville (Garden Street). A fifth location will open in Port St. John by the end of January on North Cocoa Boulevard.

• Family Dollar. Construction of a new Family Dollar store is underway on Dairy Road, just west of Singleton Avenue. The new 8,300-square-foot store will replace the already-existing outlet in the Dairy Plaza Shopping Center across the road.

• Solamere Grand apartments. A new 216-unit apartment complex is being built on Knox McRae Drive across from Jackson Middle School. Solamere Grand will feature one- and two-bedroom apartments with rents ranging from $985 to $1,125. The apartments are expected to be open by the end of May.

• Kutrybe Eye Institute. A new medical facility will take over a vacant lot once occupied by Family Auto Mart in Downtown Titusville. The new 7,000 square-foot medical office will house an ophthalmology practice and optometry clinic. Construction has not yet started, but building permits have been issued. The North Brevard Economic Development Zone granted $89,000 worth of incentives to make this project happen.

• Greek restaurant. There isn't a name yet, but a new Greek restaurant will be built in place of a former rental car building just across the street from Titusville High School on U.S. 1. The new restaurant will be run by Michael Houvardas, whose family owns Steve's Family Diner in Titusville. The restaurant will feature a mix of Mediterranean and American food, he said. Skewers and create-your-own-salads will be among featured menu items. Houvardas said he hopes to see the restaurant up and running in the next four months or so, but right now things are a bit ""touch and go"" as construction moves onward.

2437148126,"MAHIA PENINSULA, New Zealand-The next generation of satellite executives dream of firing a rocket a week into the skies. But they're running up against an unusual problem for star trekkers. A lack of space.

""We went to all the launch ranges in America,"" said Peter Beck, a wiry-haired engineer who a decade ago founded Calif.-based aerospace company Rocket Lab. ""They just didn't allow the frequency that we needed in order to make space accessible for everybody.""

Finding an empty corner of the world isn't easy for an industry expected to launch as many as 3,000 microsatellites over the next several years.

Take out flight paths of commercial airlines, shipping routes, towns and cities and the map shrinks pretty quickly. In the U.S., orbital launch sites are government owned, which represents another drawback in terms of cost and access. There's Siberia, of course, but the idea of taking commercially sensitive technology to Russia makes some executives uneasy, before factoring in difficulties in getting there.

""A small island nation in the middle of nowhere,"" said Mr. Beck, ""is pretty much exactly what you want.""

Welcome to New Zealand: earthquake-prone, dotted with volcanoes and containing six times as many sheep as people. The country doesn't even have a combat air force, having scrapped its warplanes about 15 years ago to save money.

Yet the South Pacific country has become the unlikely frontier in a drive to open a private rocket-launch site, servicing a soaring market for tiny satellites, many the size of a shoe box.

Mr. Beck, a native New Zealander whose company controls what it calls the world's first private orbital-launch complex, sees the remote location as a help rather than hindrance-there is almost nothing but ocean between New Zealand and South America. That gives the company easy access to airspace, compared with the busy air and sea movements around the U.S., as well a bigger range of lucrative orbit paths.

Budding satellite entrepreneurs swiftly encountered a problem: New Zealand hadn't expected to join the space race. Putting rockets into the skies required a regulatory framework, which the country lacked. It also needed a safeguard agreement with the U.S. to maintain secrecy around prized rocket technology. In a country averse to showiness, New Zealand's Parliament seemed surprised by the novelty.

On a recent day, lawmaker David Clark rose to speak at the first reading of the Outer Space and High Altitude Activities Bill to croon a recital of Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" to general bemusement. ""She packed my bags last night, pre-flight. Zero hour 9 a.m.,"" said Mr. Clark. ""Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone.""

David Bowie, Darth Vader, ""The Muppet Show"" and ""Pigs in Space"" also came up in discussions of the bill, which the government hopes will become law by mid-2017. The legislation includes setting up a regulatory agency and signing international safeguards conventions. Mr. Beck already has permission to conduct test flights of the company's rockets.

On the Mahia Peninsula-a spit of mountainous farmland where Rocket Lab has built its launch pad-the space industry's arrival hasn't come without commotion. A ""secret"" here used to mean protecting prized surf breaks and lobster-fishing sites from summer tourists.

Farmers Pat and Sue O'Brien, who graze sheep and cattle beside the new launch-pad access road, say Rocket Lab's arrival spawned conspiracy theories. ""People are slowly getting the mindset Rocket Lab are a great big space freight company, rather than one carrying bombs and nuclear weapons,"" said Mr. O'Brien. ""There have been some crazy questions at community meetings.""

Mark Browne, a contractor hired to repair dirt roads over Mahia's precipitous passes to turn them from farm tracks to roads safe for trucks carrying rocket fuel, said secrecy provisions enforced by Rocket Lab meant he couldn't even tell staff what they were working on, while also triggering other unexpected concerns.

""People like to treat the road now like a rally circuit,"" Mr. Browne said. ""They come around a corner expecting no one to be there. A truck with a rocket is a bit of a surprise.""

For Mahia's volunteer fire brigade, made up mostly of farmers, the prospect of a rocket accident raised eyebrows. Nigel Hall, who heads the New Zealand Fire Service here, has been carrying out practice drills and plans to have extra people on hand when Rocket Lab starts test launches early in 2017.

""The mixing of fuel products used to launch the rocket was something new to most us,"" Mr. Hall said. ""But we eventually reckoned if there was some kind of failure, after the bang we'd just be left with what we're usually left with round here: a grass fire. There's nothing else to burn.""

Rocket Lab, backed by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp., hopes to be the first company to begin commercially launching miniaturized satellites on a weekly basis from its own launch site. The company plans to use a newly constructed pad here and a two-stage 'Electron' rocket, built of carbon composite and 3D-printed, battery-powered engines.

Residents of the Mahia Peninsula, who call themselves ""Mahiatians,"" can sense an opportunity for jobs and rocket tourism in their new but still alien industry, with plans to build holiday units and offer bus rides to starry-eyed space tourists.

""The last thing that happened here that stirred up so much excitement, with people for and against, was the plan for a new sewerage system,"" said Janey Bowen, owner of the Cafe Mahia restaurant, who plans to rebrand it as Mahia's Rocket Café. On the revamped menu: a thruster hamburger, rocket cookies and a galaxy smoothie.

On a remote peninsula that only a few years ago had no web access, internet company owner Ronald Brice said he has had to install broadband links with speeds allowing Rocket Lab to monitor launches from Auckland, 370 miles away.

""Most people in Mahia now have world-leading broadband,"" said Mr. Brice.

Others are a touch underwhelmed, being more attuned over the years to other legendary exploits along the coast here. Mahia is where the folkloric Maori hero Maui is said to have punched himself in the nose to draw blood and lure a fish that turned out to be New Zealand's North Island.

""I have been to Cape Canaveral to see a rocket go up once,"" said Pauline Tangiora, a Maori elder from Mahia's Rongomaiwahine Tribe. ""It didn't impress me at all.""

2437255753,"SpaceX's first Falcon 9 rocket launch since an explosion in September will now lift off no earlier than Saturday (Jan. 14), a five-day delay that's due to high winds, rain and schedule conflicts at the company's California launch site. 

SpaceX representatives announced the launch delay on Twitter on Sunday (Jan. 8). At the time, SpaceX was targeting a Monday launch of Falcon 9 from a pad at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base to send 10 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit for satellite operator Iridium. 

""Launch moving due to high winds and rains at Vandenberg,"" SpaceX representatives wrote in the Twitter post. ""Other range conflicts this week results in next available launch date being Jan 14.""

SpaceX aims to return its Falcon 9 rockets to flight more than four months after a Falcon 9 carrying another commercial satellite, Israel's Amos-6 communications satellite, was destroyed Sept. 1 in an explosion during a routine pre-launch test at the company's Florida launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. [Dramatic Video of SpaceX's Rocket Explosion]

In a Jan. 2 statement, SpaceX representatives stated that the explosion occurred when the aluminum liner of a composite overwrapped helium tank inside the Falcon 9 rocket's upper stage liquid oxygen tank buckled.

This buckling allowed liquid oxygen propellant to pool between the aluminum liner and carbon overwrap covering, according to SpaceX. The pooling propellant ultimately ignited, rupturing the helium tank and leading to the loss of the Falcon 9 on the pad. The company is modifying its helium-loading processes to avoid similar problems in the future.

Last week, on Jan. 6, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a launch license to SpaceX for its upcoming Falcon 9 mission. That announcement came one day after Musk announced via Twitter the success of a Falcon 9 engine static test firing at its launchpad, a standard SpaceX test performed before each Falcon 9 mission."
2437261890,"Four months after a launch pad explosion sidelined SpaceX, the company was ready to return to flight on Sunday.

There was just one little problem: the weather.

SpaceX was set to launch Iridium communications satellites into orbit on Sunday from Vandenberg Air Force Base. However, high winds and rain led to the decision to postpone the launch. The next opportunity will be January 14 at 9:54 am, according to a tweet from SpaceX.

The launch was set to come one week after SpaceX shared the findings of an investigation into a launchpad anomaly in September, which destroyed an AMOS-6 communications satellite for a Facebook-Eutelsat joint venture, which would have brought internet access to underserved parts of the world.

The cause of the anomaly is complex. Chilled helium apparently caused carbon fibers and aluminum to cool at different rates in the second stage of the rocket. That created gaps between two layers of overwrap, where liquid oxygen escaped and got trapped.

This chain of events then led to the failure of one of the protective layers. Static ignited the trapped oxygen, setting off a chain of catastrophic explosions, SpaceX said.

2437288633,"Hyperloop One's 2016 was about as good as yours: Some good moments (even great ones) and some very, very bad ones.

The next-gen transportation company, which is building a unique people-mover platform based on a design by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, had a milestone moment last spring . In the arid Las Vegas desert and with hundreds of parched journalists watching, it publicly tested the propulsion system for its planned tube-based transportation network that could cut hours-long travel between cities down to minutes. Hyperloop One estimates a trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco will take just 30 minutes. The test itself lasted just a few seconds, but Hyperloop One also spent the day proudly showcasing all the progress it was making on building the tubes and preparing for full-scale human transportation by 2021.

Hyperloop One promised more exciting tests before the end of the year for more exciting demonstrations.

Then it all appeared to fall apart.

Flamboyant company CTO and Co-Flounder Brogan BamBrogan was shown the door and then he promptly sued , blasting co-founder and Executive Chairman Shervin Pishevar, alleging nepotism, mismanagement and veiled threats. It was an ugly scene that undermined Hyperloop One's credibility and lingered on until the fall when Hyperloop One and BamBrogan settled out of court .

Since then, the company has reorganized and sought to regain its footing and stride. Pishevar appears to have stepped back a bit while former SVP of Engineering Josh Giegel took over at CTO.

I found Giegel, Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd and SVP of Global Operations Nick Earle on the floor of CES in Las Vegas last week. Like the rest of us, they were running between meetings and presentations, but I managed to ask them what I consider five critical questions.

What follows is our brief discussion, edited for clarity.

Do you feel like you've stumbled?

Rob Lloyd:

Actually, I am extremely proud of the company's grit, focus and execution and I think we've accomplished things that most people thought would be quite impossible.

We've continued to build the team, 225 today in the company. The quality of that team continues to be at the highest level on every function. We've built out our facilities. We've made progress on our development loop, which is the primary focus of the company. We've raised $50 million more equity. We've built a 105,000-square foot factory 21 miles from where we're standing. And we are so close to showing the world that Hyperloop is real, since the last time we talked. I think that's an amazingly incredible track record and something every one of our employees is very proud of.

Is that where we drove to, 21 miles outside to the factory?

Lloyd:

You haven't been to the factory. It was 33 miles to the development loop. Maybe 34 to the post site, and we built two preparation areas. The development loop, Josh [Giegel] was there this morning and, literally, the progress on building dev loop, which is the company's focus, to show a prototype, to build a prototype, to show the world that Hyperloop is real, has been phenomenal. But the facilities around that are amazing.

Work on the test facility continues.

Image: hyperloop one

The 105,000-square foot facility 20 miles from here is a fabrication site where Josh and his team have hired welders and fabricators and machinists. They're building components and learning the methodology of manufacturing the technology that will be part of Hyperloop and that learning will be part of what we continue to develop on our site, and also at some of the customer engagement sites we have around the world as we move from an early development site to one that would be more like an early production site, which is really the focus of the company.

Are you still on schedule?

Josh Giegel:

As far as near term dates, we talked about basically starting our... conducting our development loop, beginning construction on that at the end of last year [2016], which we did and [we are] continuing construction right now. Starting testing basically within the next couple of months here, if not sooner.

Hyperloop One CTO Josh Giegel (left) speaking with media after last spring's successful test.

Image: lance ulanoff/mashable

Then, after that, we have engaged with RTA [Roads & Transportation Authority] on the ground in Dubai and in a couple of other spots around the world that are moving into how do we actually build this in your country and how do we actually regulate this?

And then we're looking for the 2020 timeline for cargo and 2021 for people. That's still what we're targeting at this stage.

What do you think, at this moment, are your biggest hurdles?

Giegel:

The biggest challenge we have at this spot, taking it to production, is ... So we're doing a proof of technology, proof of concept in the desert, right? That's our R&D facility. The next rev of that, the next version of that is taking this same performance, or better performance, and driving the cost down. So, that's what we're going to be spending 2017 on. And 2018 is going to be really going through a lot of the, building these and moving those into a, this is a new type of product, a higher-performing, low-cost sort of product, which will ultimately get us to the point that we want to be at to be extremely compelling in the marketplace.

Lloyd:

Second thing that I always thought was going to be a challenge was the certification and regulatory environment, where we are dealing with technology that isn't regulated. Firstly, there is no regulation for Hyperloop and we have to work with regulators to write them. Secondly, typically, these things are done, 'We'll build and then we'll ask you to certify it,' but we are approaching it quite differently. We're collaborating with regulators before we've even finalized the design of the product. Having them weigh in and give us advice as to how to design and develop the product in such a way that they would approve it.

So, we're way further back in that process than normally happens in a highly-regulated transportation technology, and we're learning so much about what we would do and the decisions that Josh's team would make. So, that, a couple of years from now, that regulator was a part of that, very collaborative and then they'll be almost co-authors as to how that technology can be regulated. I think that's what we're looking for in terms of negating that risk. So, that was one that concerned me and I am pleased with the progress we've made and how much positive reception we've had.

Nick Earle:

I would add that the third challenge as we go to market point of view is really very unusual, which is too much opportunity.

I've been in the IT business for over 30 years. Typically, you go out to customers to try and persuade them to be interested. We had the opposite problem. We had 2,800 entries for The Hyperloop Global Challenge and we whittled them down to 35 that was announced today. But if you think about that, that's 35 entries, not just for teams, but teams that each have somebody at the government or regional level who's in transportation planning saying, 'I support this bid.'

Image: hyperloop one

So, what we've got is 35, government -supported requests for us to build Hyperloops.

We need to qualify and just do a few initially and make sure we get them absolutely right. Se we have a very unusual, at least in my experience, challenge, which is, we really have to be crisp over qualifying which ones that we go after because there is so much demand and so much interest. You could argue it's a nice problem to have, but I'd argue that actually it's a tough problem to have.

What is up with Dubai? Dubai seemed to come out of nowhere. When I read about it, I wondered, is Dubai going to get Hyperloop first?

Giegel:

They put together, the Dubai Future Foundation, put together an accelerator. It's an incubator for startups, so to speak, in that area. And what they were doing was providing office space, but they're also providing connections to the regulatory and government officials that you need to take a project to scale. We got into that fairly quickly in August and we mobilized a small team, about five of us that went over there for the better part of five months, actually a team is still there, and we moved through that process, we were the first team to move out of that process into the actual feasibility study with the government body there.

[embedded content]

They put together a plan together to attract technology talents and technology opportunity to Dubai and to the UAE and completely opened their doors and said, 'Go ahead and you're gonna need to talk to these people.' And so, 'Let's do it.'

Is there a chance that Dubai would have Hyperloop One first?

Lloyd:

Yeah, there's a chance that that could be first. It's certainly not decided. There's much more work that needs to be done. There's a chance that that could occur in Europe. There's a chance that that could occur in Asia. And, quite frankly, we're just saying, we need a number of places that really want to do this. So, we can make the decision, the strategic decision, that Nick just mentioned, is when we prioritized and put our resources behind those projects, we're really prioritizing that they're going to get through the entire construction phase, have the government contingent to support them, that we can finance them and raise the capital. That's another thing in the filter that still has to happen. So, we can get the most phenomenal, high-potential, impactful new route, but we'll need to be able to raise project financing to then construct that.

There's a lot of filters to go through.

Dubai is a possibility, but we've got more work to do there, and I think, along with the regulator, we're very happy with where we are, but we're still working really hard with the team.

How soon can I ride?

Lloyd:

2437307030,"WASHINGTON - Spanish rocket startup PLD Space said Jan. 9 that it has raised the money it needs to continue development of its Arion 1 reusable suborbital launch vehicle thanks to a $7.1 million investment round lead by satellite ground systems provider GMV of Madrid, Spain.

Arion 1 is a kerosene-fueled, single-stage rocket designed to use a combination of parachute and propulsion to land after lofting its 200-kilogram payload into a 250-kilometer suborbital trajectory. PLD is positioning the Arion 1 as both a commercial suborbital launcher and technology demonstrator for Arion 2, a three-stage smallsat launcher designed to haul up to 150 kilograms to low Earth orbits between 400 and 1,200-kilometers.

The first launch of Arion 1 is planned for 2018 with Arion 2 to follow in 2020. PLD Space plans to charge 30,000-35,000 per kilogram for orbital launches, or roughly $4.75 million to $5.5 million per launch.

GMV was the single largest investor in PLD Space's latest financing round, contributing about 3 million euros ($3.2 million) of the 6.7 million euros the company raised in Series A1 equity. A combination of public and private investors, including the European Commission, Spain's Technological and Industrial Development Centre, CDTI, and Spain's Startup Co-Investment Fund, ENISA, provided the remaining 3.7 million euros, PLD Space Co-founder and Chief Executive Raul Torres told SpaceNews. PLD Space will use the investment to ""begin the complete development of ARION 1 and all the facilities required for its manufacture, integration, testing and launch,"" according to its press release.

GMV's chief executive, Jesús B. Serrano, will be given a seat on PLD Space's board of directors. Torres said GMV's stake in the company will be less than 15 percent, but declined to give a specific number.

GMV's primary space business is supplying ground control systems for commercial telecommunications satellites and European institutional projects. But the company - whose 2015 revenue topped 125 million euro - has also been involved in launcher programs, including Arianespace's Vega small satellite launcher and the European Space Agency's IXV experimental reentry vehicle. In addition to taking a stake in PLD Space, GMV will develop the avionics subsystems for Arion 1 and Arion 2.

Founded in 2011, PLD Space closed a roughly $1.6 million investment round in 2013, and last year gained $1.56 million through Spain's Tecnología Española de Propulsión Reutilizable Espacial para Lanzadores, or TEPREL program, plus about $800,000 through the European Space Agency's future launchers preparatory program.

PLD Space plans to relocate this year from the Universidad Miguel Hernández's Science Park to a new plant in Elche, a city on Spain's southeastern coast. PLD Space also plans to set up new engine testbeds about three hours away at the general aviation Teruel Airport where the company currently does its propulsion testing.

The maiden flight of Arion 1 will take place at at El Arenosillo, a launch site in southwestern Spain for sounding rockets and high-altitude balloons. GMV will support PLD Space with integration, qualification and launch-support operations for both trial and commercial flights."
2437419802,"ELAINE QUIJANO: Finally tonight, SpaceX`s highly anticipated return to space was delayed Sunday. SpaceX had hoped to launch its Falcon 9 rocket early this week, but bad weather at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California pushed the launch to next Saturday. Kenneth Craig has more on this high-stakes mission for SpaceX.

(Begin VT)

KENNETH CRAIG: Four months after this devastating explosion that destroyed an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket in Cape Canaveral, SpaceX says it`s ready to give it another go. The rocket is ready to send ten Iridium satellites into space but bad weather at the California launch site has forced the delay. Bill Harwood is CBS News`s space consultant.

So, Bill, how much is at stake here?

BILL HARWOOD: This flight`s extremely important to SpaceX. They really do need to restore confidence in the Falcon 9 rocket after its failure back in September.

KENNETH CRAIG: SpaceX chalked up eighteen successful flights in a row before 2015 launch failure and another nine flights before the spectacular September launch pad mishap.

BILL HARWOOD: Clearly, two failures in twenty-nine rockets is not the kind of record that SpaceX founder Elon Musk wants.

KENNETH CRAIG: It comes as the billionaire, who has his eye on Mars, finds himself in an increasingly competitive space race with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and even more traditional rocket companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

BILL HARWOOD: Already-- they already launched a sub-orbital rocket, so there`s a-- a big competition heating up between them. Every flight is important in these kind of high-stakes launches.

KENNETH CRAIG: Musk is setting his sights higher for 2018 with a manned test of SpaceX Dragon capsule. He hopes it will eventually bring astronauts to the International Space Station.

ELAINE QUIJANO: Good evening. I`m Elaine Quijano. This is our western edition.

Chilling new video has surfaced of the deadly airport attack in Fort Lauderdale. In a moment we will show you the portion of the video where the gunman opens fire. We`re also learning more about the gun used in the attack and more about the five people who were killed. We begin with David Begnaud.

(Begin VT)

DAVID BEGNAUD: Two young boys walking with a man appear first in the video, then comes twenty-six-year-old Esteban Santiago. That`s him in blue. He reaches into his waistband, pulls out the gun and starts shooting. A man in gray appears to have been the first one shot, people behind him drop to the floor. One woman hides behind a luggage cart. There is no audio on the twenty-second recording posted by TMZ. It appears to be authentic surveillance video but it`s unclear how TMZ got the video. A law enforcement source tells CBS News the 9-millimeter handgun Santiago used to kill five people and wound six others was the same handgun he had when he went to an FBI office in Anchorage, Alaska, last November. The Iraq War veteran complained to federal agents there that his mind was being controlled by U.S. intelligence and that he was being forced to watch ISIS terror videos. Police confiscated Santiago`s gun and had him committed for a mental evaluation for four days. About a month later police returned the gun to Santiago. U.S. District Attorney Karen Loeffler:

KAREN LOEFFLER: There is a federal law with regard to having a gun by somebody who is mentally ill. But the law requires that the person be, quote, ""Adjudicated mentally ill,"" which is a difficult standard.

DAVID BEGNAUD: In Puerto Rico, Santiago`s mother Elizabeth Ruiz says her son sounded strange during their last phone call which was less than two weeks ago.

(Elizabeth Ruiz speaking foreign language)

DAVID BEGNAUD: ""I`m feeling like don`t know, scream, cry,"" she said. ""Because since he was so far away, I could not do anything."" Santiago allegedly confessed to planning the airport attack and apparently chose Fort Lauderdale at random. A portion of the baggage claim area where the shooting happened has been reopened but curtains now shield people from seeing the crime scene, a mass shooting at a major U.S. airport.

(End VT)

DAVID BEGNAUD: Federal prosecutors say the gunman aimed at the head of each of his victims. And he stopped shooting only when he ran out of bullets and then dropped the gun on the ground. Elaine, he will face a judge tomorrow morning. He could get the death penalty.

ELAINE QUIJANO: David Begnaud, thank you.

2437748167,"The U.S. Air Force's mysterious X-37B space plane has now spent 600 days in Earth orbit on the vessel's latest mission, and is nearing a program record for longest time spent in space.

The robotic X-37B lifted off atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on May 20, 2015, kicking off the program's fourth space mission (which is known as Orbital Test Vehicle-4, or OTV-4).

If the uncrewed spacecraft spends 74 more days aloft, it will break the duration record set during OTV-3, which touched down in October 2014. [The X-37B's Fourth Mystery Mission in Photos]

But it's unclear how long OTV-4 will last, or just what the X-37B is doing as it circles Earth; most details about the space plane's missions and payloads are classified.

Milestone record keeping

The first OTV mission began on April 22, 2010, and concluded on Dec. 3 of that year, following 224 days of orbit. OTV-2 lifted off on March 5, 2011, and landed on June 16, 2012, after 468 days in orbit.

The record-setting OTV-3 mission chalked up nearly 675 days in orbit, circling Earth from Dec. 11, 2012, until Oct. 17, 2014.

All three previous OTV missions have come down to Earth at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but that may change for OTV-4's landing, whenever it occurs.

Heading for Florida?

Progress has been made on consolidating X-37B space plane operations, including the use of NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida as a landing site for the robotic space plane.

A former KSC space-shuttle facility known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1 (OPF-1) was converted into a structure that will enable the Air Force ""to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV),"" according to representatives of the aerospace giant Boeing.

X-37B vehicle development falls under the control of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems in El Segundo, California, which is Boeing's center for all space and experimental systems and government and commercial satellites.

The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office is leading the Department of Defense's OTV initiative, by direction of the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics and the secretary of the Air Force.

Fleet size

To date, only two reusable X-37B vehicles have been confirmed as constituting the space plane fleet. The current OTV-4 mission is the second flight of the second X-37B vehicle built for the Air Force by Boeing.

The military space plane looks like a miniature version of NASA's retired space shuttle orbiter. The X-37B is just 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 9.6 feet (2.9 m) tall, and has a wingspan of nearly 15 feet (4.6 m). For comparison, the space shuttles were each 122 feet (37 m) long, with wingspans of 78 feet (24 m).

The X-37B has a payload bay about the size of a pickup truck bed that can be outfitted with a robotic arm. It has a launch weight of 11,000 lbs. (4,990 kilograms) and is powered in orbit by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries.

Payloads aboard

Some payloads aboard the OTV-4 craft have been previously identified.

For example, Aerojet Rocketdyne has said that its XR-5A Hall Thruster had completed initial in-orbit validation testing aboard the X-37B space plane. Also on board is a NASA advanced-materials investigation.

Such test-bedding of equipment is one of the main purposes of OTV missions, along with the development of reusable-spacecraft technologies, Air Force officials have said. 

""It remains a very useful way to test out things,"" Winston Beauchamp, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space, told Space.com last September during an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) meeting in Long Beach, California.

When asked about adding more X-37Bs to the nation's fleet, Beauchamp said that the current number of vehicles meets the Air Force's needs."

2438000086,"WASHINGTON - The French space agency, CNES, will supply two spacecraft cameras to a team from India competing for the Google Lunar X Prize, and has formed a working group with the Indian Space Research Organization to study reusable launch technology.

CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall, visiting Bangalore, India, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced the agreements in a Jan. 9 statement.

The French space agency signed a letter of intent last June to contribute Color CMOS Camera for Space Exploration, (CASPEX) cameras to Axiom Research Labs, a Bangalore-based startup leading X Prize contender TeamIndus. During Le Gall's recent trip to India, CNES specified the provision of two CASPEX cameras for TeamIndus' rover.

CNES described Bangalore as ""establishing itself after California as one of the most promising nerve centres of NewSpace.""

""To stay competitive, we need to combine the best innovations and that is the goal of CNES's partnership with Indian space players,"" Le Gall said in the press release.

Teams vying for the $20 million Google Lunar X Prize grand prize must be the first to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface, travel a minimum of 500 meters, and transmit video and other data back to Earth. Team Indus has a contract with ISRO for a launch aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV); Japan-based Hakuto is hitching a ride for its rover on the TeamIndus lander as well.

Although India has its rockets for launching polar-orbiting and geosynchronous satellites, ISRO continues to rely regularly on Evry, France-based Arianespace to orbit Indian satellites. The October launch of GSAT-18 on an Ariane 5 marked the 20th ISRO satellite to launch with the European provider, of which CNES had a 35 percent stake until November when Airbus Safran Launchers purchased its shares.

CNES has now agreed to form a working group on space launcher technologies with ISRO, and to train Indian engineers at its facilities. A technical working group is responsible for gauging synergies between French and Indian rocketry and studying future concepts ""especially in the domain of reusable launch vehicles,"" according to the press release.

Europe's future launchers, the Ariane 6 and Vega C, are both expendable rockets, but reusable launch vehicles remain a field of study. In June Airbus Defence and Space unveiled Adeline - short for Advanced Expendable Launcher with Innovative engine Economy - a project that proposes returning the most expensive parts of an Ariane first stage by deploying wings and landing on a runway. French aerospace research agency ONERA also kicked off a three-year research program with six other European partner countries on a semi-reusable vehicle called the Air Launch space Transportation using an Automated aircraft and an Innovative Rocket (ALTAIR), meant for small satellites between 50 and 150 kilograms. ALTAIR would target low Earth orbit missions between 400 and 1,000 kilometers.

In June, ISRO flew an experimental winged spacecraft called the Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator on an HS9 booster, meant to lead the way to a fully reusable two-stage vehicle. The agency's flagship rocket, the PSLV, is expendable."
2438016423,"The University of Washington's Hyperloop team is getting ready to compete in a set of pod races aimed at blazing a trail for a new means of near-supersonic travel - but they need a little help to get to the starting line in California.

This week, team members kicked off a crowdfunding campaign on UW's Useed online platform to raise $20,000 for their quest.

""it's paramount for our current and future success,"" Luke Marcoe, the team's marketing and public relations lead, told GeekWire in an email.

The campaign already has gotten into high gear: More than $10,000 was raised on the first day, thanks to contributions from just two donors.

Even before this week, the student-led engineering project benefited from the expertise and material contributions from more than a dozen sponsors and advisers. Marcoe figures those donations have amounted to about $20,000 so far.

""We are one of the cheapest teams - not 'cheap,' but frugal,"" he told GeekWire during a meet-up at the Hyperloop team's lair at UW's Eastlake Lab.

UW's team is due to compete with more than 20 others at a mile-long Hyperloop test track, built beside SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif. The Jan. 27-29 pod races are the culmination of an effort inspired by SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk, who came up with the Hyperloop concept three and a half years ago.

The idea is to create a network of vacuum-sealed tubes through which magnetically levitating pods can travel at near the speed of sound (760 mph). Such a system could get passengers from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a half-hour - or from Seattle to Portland in 15 minutes.

A couple of commercial ventures are already working on Hyperloop transit systems in Nevada, Dubai and other locales. One of them, Hyperloop One, is a sponsor of the UW team. But for now, Musk is staying out of the commercial fray and supporting the student competition instead.

UW engineering student David Coven, the team's business management lead, said he latched onto the Hyperloop contest soon after it was announced.

""It's something that's never been done,"" Coven explained. ""Being on the ground floor of a next-generation technology in transportation gives me a lot of hope and excitement about being a part of what the future of transportation will look like.""

(SpaceX via YouTube) Malachi Williams, manufacturing lead for UWashington Hyperloop, brings a visitor into a production and testing area at the Eastlake Lab. The area, which is surrounded by plastic sheeting, is nicknamed the ""Dexter Zone."" 

Dozens of students joined the team and submitted their design in an initial round of the contest a year ago. The judges selected UW's entry to go forward to the construction stage and take part in this month's finals. They also gave the design's safety subsystem a special award for technical excellence.

Since then, the students have been putting in long hours building, testing and fine-tuning the components for their pod. Now they're down to the wire. The final tasks include integrating the magnet-equipped undercarriage with a carbon composite shell and getting the completed pod down to California.

For the university-level races at SpaceX, the pods will be one-quarter-scale and are expected travel through the tube track at around 100 mph. The winners will be determined not only on the basis of speed, but also based on quality of construction, safety and other factors.

The students have given fanciful names to the components they're building. One test article, used to simulate the pod's passage through SpaceX's track, is called the Stallion. A spinning disk that tests the pod's braking system is nicknamed the Meat Slicer, while the undercarriage is known as the Heifer.

The team is toying with the idea of calling their racer the ""Dawgpod,"" but they're also reserving some naming rights for the top donor in the Useed crowdfunding campaign. If the support keeps coming in, UWashington Hyperloop plans to go on to SpaceX's second competition this summer, in which speed is everything.

Coven, Marcoe and their teammates can't predict whether they'll be involved in building a Seattle-to-Portland Hyperloop someday, but they say at least one thing is clear: The pod races are already speeding up their progress toward future careers.

""We've gotten real-world work experience - a lot of stuff that you don't learn in the classroom,"" Marcoe said. ""How to network, how do you establish relationships, how to maintain those relationships, and so forth. It's been a great experience for everyone, whether you're an engineer, or on the business team, or doing PR. We're not really a club. I see us as a startup."""

2438143616,"Tesla Motors on Wednesday announced it is hiring 11-year Apple veteran Chris Lattner to its autonomous technology team. The announcement came the same day Lattner's departure from Apple as senior director of development tools was confirmed.

Lattner was a prominent figure in the Apple development community having overseen the creation of its open-source Swift programming language.

Teslsa said Lattner will become its vice president of Autopilot software, taking the reins 
from Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX's VP of software, who had been serving in a dual role.

A fun twist to Lattner's hiring is a number of comments made by Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk after Apple hired away several Tesla engineers to its secretive automative 'Project Titan' in 2015. Musk called Apple ""a Tesla graveyard"" adding, ""They have hired people we've fired. If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding.""

Read Tesla's full announcement below:

We would like to welcome Chris Lattner, who will join Tesla as our Vice President of Autopilot Software. Chris' reputation for engineering excellence is well known. He comes to Tesla after 11 years at Apple where he was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms and one of the fastest growing languages for doing so on Linux. Prior to Apple, Chris was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that is widely used in commercial products and academic research today.

As Chris joins Tesla, we would like to give a special thanks to Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX's Vice President of Software, who has been serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Autopilot Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time. We would like to thank Jinnah for the efforts needed to achieve excellence in both roles, David Nister, our Vice President of Autopilot Vision, and the team for their exceptional work in advancing Autopilot.

We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving."
2438143619,"Apple's Swift head has left the company and joined Tesla, it's been confirmed today, where he'll be the automaker's VP of Autopilot Software. Chris Lattner spent eleven years at Apple, most recently as Senior Director of the Developer Tools Department. There, he was primarily responsible for creating Swift , the programming language Apple pushed developers over to in 2014, and which was made open-source in 2015.

Before that, Lattner was lead author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. Indeed, he created the LLVM project overall, and spent sixteen years at the organization working on modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Now, he's going to work on self-driving vehicles.

Until now, Tesla hasn't had a single chief responsible for Autopilot technologies. Lattner will replace Jinnah Hosein, who is actually VP of Software for SpaceX, Elon Musk's spaceship company. Hosein has been working for both companies on a temporary basis as the interim VP of Tesla Autopilot Software; now, he'll return to SpaceX full-time, Tesla says.

Lattner's decision to join the car company comes at an interesting time for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Tesla announced a significant upgrade to its Autopilot sensor suite - subsequently known as HW2 - late in 2016, dramatically increasing the number of sensors and cameras fitted as standard to all of its new cars and SUVs. They'll first be used for a so-called ""Enhanced Autopilot"" which the car company has said will begin to roll out piecemeal in 2017.

For instance, future features may include the ability to navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps without human involvement, or to change lanes without being instructed to. However Tesla's plans are far more ambitious than that. The company has said that it believes the HW2 sensor suite is sufficiently advanced to permit entirely autonomous driving eventually.

That will demand both regulations and software catch up to Elon Musk's ambitions, but the goal is a vehicle which could theoretically drive from one side of the country to the other, without anybody touching the wheel in-between. Indeed, Tesla is also scheming about how to use self-driving EVs as a ride-sharing system. That would take on Uber and others, and offer owners of its cars the chance to make a little cash on the side when they themselves aren't using their vehicles.

It's no small ambition, and it'll give Chris Lattner plenty to focus on as he joins Tesla. He'll run into some familiar faces while there, too: back in May, Musk admitted that Tesla was snagging plenty of engineering talent from Apple as a matter of course. That includes former Mac VP Doug Field back in 2013 ."
2438143945,"Tesla has a new vice president heading up Autopilot efforts - Chris Lattner, whose departure from Apple was reported only earlier today. Lattner worked at Apple for 11 years, where his chief contribution was creating Swift, Apple's most recent programming language, which is relatively easy for beginners to pick up and begin using to create apps for macOS, iOS and beyond.

The role at Tesla had been filled by SpaceX VP of Software Jinnah Hossein, who was doing double-duty at both companies (much like Elon Musk himself does in the CEO spot). Tesla says they're ""excited"" about Lattner's ability to help them ""accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" in a blog post announcing the move.

Lattner's history includes creating the Clang compiler and designing the LLVM compiler optimization infrastructure. He was also a key contributor to the evolution of Objective C and worked on Apple's Xcode software development tool during his time at the iPhone maker. He also apparently builds beautiful raw-edge wood furniture:

Tesla's poach of Lattner is a significant win for Tesla, given the breadth of his influence on software development and his expertise. Tesla announced late in 2016 that all of its vehicles going forward would have all the hardware on board necessary for full self-driving capabilities, and Elon Musk said that he's aiming to have a fully autonomous coast-to-coast test drive of a Tesla car ready for the end of this year. Lattner could be a big help in achieving those ambitious goals in Musk's typically aggressive timelines."
2438145257,"Tesla has hired Chris Lattner as vice president of autopilot software, bringing him over from Apple where he was in charge of the Developer Tools Department. At Tesla, Lattner will lead the Autopilot engineering team and ""accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" according to a Tesla blog post.

In his 11 years at Apple, Lattner led development of the Swift programming language and also led work on Xcode and Apple's CPU and GPU compilers and a number of other development tools across a variety of roles.

The departing interim vice president of Tesla Autopilot software is Jinnah Hosein, who has been working double duty at Tesla and as SpaceX's vice president of software. He will now return to a full-time role at SpaceX.

Tesla confirmed to The Verge that Sterling Anderson, former director of Autopilot programs, is no longer employed with the company."
2438219952,"Electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) has hired a key Apple Inc (AAPL.O) software engineer to oversee its Autopilot self-driving software efforts, Tesla said in a blog post Tuesday.

Chris Lattner, who served at Apple for more than a decade, said in a online message to Apple developers on Tuesday morning that he would ""leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space"" without saying which company he planned to join.

Later in the day, Tesla posted a message on the company's website saying that Lattner had been hired as vice president of Autopilot software but did not say when he would start work there. Tesla declined to comment beyond the announcement. Apple confirmed the departure but would not comment beyond Lattner's posted message.

The move is a significant win for Tesla, bringing a high-profile figure in the world of software development for a position that previously did not have a full-time leader. Tesla's Autopilot was overseen on an interim basis by the software chief Jinnah Hosein of SpaceX, which is also headed by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.

Autopilot is the hardware and software system on Tesla vehicles that allows self-driving in some situations but still requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. Federal safety regulators in the United States are examining whether Autopilot played a role in a fatal crash in Florida last year.

Lattner most recently served as a senior director in the developer tools department at Apple and was best known for introducing Swift, a programming language that made it easier for software developers to write apps for iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads.

In addition to developing Swift at Apple, Lattner also led a successful push to make the programming language ""open source,"" meaning that developers could incorporate it into their applications without having to pay fees to Apple. The move was a first for Apple, which until then had typically tightly controlled the technology it created. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) have also either published or contributed to open-source programming languages."
2438233540,"SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk famously called Apple a ""Tesla graveyard"" where his failed employees go to toil.

That was a nifty bit of Musk-esque verbal sparring in what is a growing talent war between the tech titans. But it seems he's now robbing the graveyard.

In a blog post Tuesday, Tesla announced that it was hiring 11-year Apple veteran Chris Lattner, an engineer who was primarily responsible for creating Swift, the programming language for building apps on Apple platforms. Lattner will take the wheel of Autopilot, Tesla's self-driving car program.

Lattner takes over for Jinnah Hosein, Musk-owned SpaceX's vice president of software, ""who has been serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Autopilot Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time,"" according to the post.

The move comes at a time when a growing number of automakers (from Audi to Volvo), tech companies (including Uber and much-rumored Apple) and suppliers (Nvidia, Intel, Mobileye) are throwing dollars and bodies at accelerating the arrival of an autonomous car future.

Tesla currently equips all of its new Model S and X vehicles with an array of radar, laser and camera sensors that, Musk claims, can provide a fully autonomous experience for drivers.

That said, Autopilot's current features are limited, and Musk has said that he plans to gradually roll out more self-driving capability as that technology proves itself in testing.

Apple has remained mum about its autonomous car plans. A variety of reports have suggested that the iPhone-maker's automotive ambitions have shifted recently from building both the software and hardware for a vehicle to focusing instead on self-driving sensors and software that would then be used in an automaker's product.

That's always been the approach of Google, which is now seven years into its autonomous car project. Last spring, Google announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to build 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans that would contain Google sensors and software. Those vehicles were announced with some fanfare Sunday at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit."
2438315947,"The next satellite for the U.S. military's communications network, this one purchased by five international allies, has arrived in Florida for its launch in March atop a Delta 4 rocket.

The ninth Wideband Global SATCOM spacecraft has been delivered to Cape Canaveral from the Boeing factory in Los Angeles.

A United Launch Alliance Delta 4 vehicle will propel the craft into space on March 8 during a 121-minute window that opens at 6:35 p.m. EST (2335 GMT).

WGS 9 was built with funding from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and New Zealand.

The partner nations bought the satellite in exchange for access to the entire constellation, similar to the groundbreaking deal with Australia that paid for the construction and launch of WGS 6.

The arrival of WGS 9 comes just a month after the successful launch of WGS 8 aboard another Delta 4 from the Cape. The satellite is undergoing electric propulsion maneuvers to reach geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above Earth."
2438565814,"""Youth is a must for the new breed,"" writes Alexandra Wolfe in Valley of the Gods: A Silicon Valley Story (Simon & Schuster, $27), a jauntily paced anthropological look at Northern California's techtopia. The Palo Alto semispoof is becoming a crowded genre (Mike Judge's HBO show, Antonio García Martínez's memoir Chaos Monkeys, etc.), but Wolfe, a Wall Street Journal reporter and former Bloomberg Businessweek columnist, has found relevant new eyes through which to show outsiders around: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel's first fellows.

In her prologue, Wolfe tells us she befriended Thiel in 2006 when he invited her to a salon at his New York home. One of the libertarian Trump supporter's pet contrarianisms is that the tech revolution has made college obsolete. So in 2011, he started his fellowship program, giving 20 kids under age 20 $100,000 each to ""stop out"" of college for two years, move to the Valley, and start a business-preferably one that would change the world. Wolfe, given entrée by Thiel, loosely stakes her story on three fellows, though the narrative isn't entirely theirs.

She veers along a number of off-roads like a driverless car programmed by one of the Valley's underslept child-engineers. We visit coder communes; get a glimpse into weird eating customs, transgressive yoga regimens, and dress preferences (T-shirts); absorb the influence of power players (Uber's Travis Kalanick, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla and SpaceX's Elon Musk, Google's Sergey Brin); and learn the culture's leitmotifs-developing outer space, failing, getting rich but pretending not to care, fine-tuning artificial intelligence, and curing death.

It's an interest in the last theme that helps Laura Deming, Wolfe's most compelling subject, win her fellowship. Deming had been toiling in labs since age 12, hoping to locate the secret behind the human life span (so limiting!). Her Thiel-approved scheme is the Longevity Fund, which funnels venture capital to scientists working in that realm-one such group is trying to ""delete"" old cells from the body. In the Valley, her idea has competition: Google co-founder Larry Page's Calico labs has $750 million and its own research team. (Thiel's vampiric interest in the actual blood of the young, in the form of a transfusion procedure called parabiosis, has been documented, though it isn't in the book-an odd omission, since mice transfusions are.)

Deming struggles to find capital-""It was a hard sell in her case, because the results were so far away,"" Wolfe writes-but the rare female starter-upper eventually ""becomes the darling of Silicon Valley's aspiring immortals,"" accepting speaking engagements and awards. Still, Deming flounders on the shoals of meaninglessness, watching cash being thrown at half-baked ideas, and she grows wispy on a fruitarian diet that ""helped her fit into a place where baseline nerdiness wasn't nearly enough.""

Fellow fellow James Proud, a South Londoner, has better luck emotionally and fiscally. After five years, he raises $50 million for a sleep tracker called Sense and sets up an office in San Francisco's hip Potrero Hill neighborhood. John Burnham, who got into the program with a plan to mine asteroids, is one of the few to return to college. The book ends with him finding analog satisfaction in a humanities program.
Wolfe's father is Tom Wolfe, whom she acknowledges as her writerly spirit guide in the book's first chapter. She notes that CrossFit trainers cycle with tech clients past psychedelic guru Ken Kesey's house on Old La Honda Road. He and his Merry Pranksters were the subject of Tom's dropout-lit classic, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. ""The techies' one true obsession is work,"" Wolfe Jr. writes. ""The Pranksters' one true obsession was not working, which Kesey calls 'moving off dead center,' and taking hallucinogens until, as he also called it, 'you junked it out through the other side.' "" These might seem like antithetical positions. But the fever dreams fueling the Valley-capitalism on acid-are no less hallucinogenic than the Pranksters' and are best interpreted in only one way: Kids, stay in school."

2438616327,"Electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced on Tuesday that it just snapped up Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) director of developer tools, Chris Lattner. The executive was integral at Apple, responsible for creating Swift, a new programming language the tech giant announced in 2014. The important hire comes at a critical time for Tesla as it works to advance the software behind its next-generation driver-assist sensor system for Autopilot.

From Swift to Autopilot
Lattner's decision to leave Apple and join Tesla ""wasn't taken lightly,"" according to a statement Lattner posted on Swift.org to explain the move. Indeed, Lattner said he won't be entirely leaving the Swift community. ""I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list,"" he said.

But make no mistake. Lattner is definitely leaving Apple and joining Tesla. In fact, he confirmed in his post that he will be leaving Apple later this month.

At Tesla, Lattner will take on the title of vice president of Autopilot software. Lattner will take over for Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX's vice president of software, who was ""serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time,"" Tesla said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" Tesla said.

To fill Lattner's role with the Swift programming language, Apple's Ted Kremenek, who is currently the senior manager of languages and runtimes at Apple, will now lead the day-to-day operations of the Swift Core Team.

Furthermore, just as Lattner is stepping up to lead Tesla's Autopilot team, Tesla's director of Autopilot programs, Sterling Anderson, is leaving the company. Interestingly, shortly after the news broke, Anderson mysteriously tweeted, ""You ain't seen nothing yet..."" 

Taking Autopilot to the next level
Lattner joins Tesla's Autopilot team at a crucial period for the technology's development, only a few months after the company made the surprising announcement that it started including full self-driving hardware in every vehicle it ships.

The new hardware included in Tesla vehicles includes eight surround cameras for 360-degree visibility for up to 250 meters of range, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors, forward-facing radar, and a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of its predecessor.

The sudden inclusion of the new hardware in every vehicle Tesla produces has presented challenges for the company, which, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk in December, have the Autopilot team working seven days a week.

First, vehicles with the new hardware temporarily lack Autopilot features included in vehicles with the older hardware as the company validates the software using customer data generated from operating the new Autopilot sensors in shadow mode as Tesla owners go about their normal day-to-day driving. While the company has started releasing updates to a portion of its vehicles delivered with the new hardware, Musk recently said he hopes the company will be ready this weekend to finally release an update to bring all new-hardware vehicles to feature parity with older vehicles.

Second, the new Autopilot sensors presented manufacturing problems during the company's fourth quarter, as Tesla blamed ""short-term production challenges"" related to its transition to the new sensors for its worse-than-expected deliveries for the quarter.

Autopilot's ongoing development is an important piece of Tesla's business as it aggressively pursues autonomous vehicles."
2438644814,"The Space Coast could see as many as 32 launches by five different rockets in 2017, the vice commander of the Air Force's 45th Space Wing said Tuesday.

That would easily surpass the 23 launch operations supported in 2016, the Eastern Range's busiest year in two decades.

""Just a tremendous year,"" said Col. Walt Jackim, in a ""State of the Wing"" presentation to the National Space Club Florida Committee in Cape Canaveral. ""It's only going to get busier for us.""

United Launch Alliance is expected to kick off the 2017 campaign with an Atlas V launch next Thursday night, Jan. 19. It's the first of at least seven launches ULA plans from Florida, including six on the Atlas V and one by a Delta IV.

Orbital ATK's Minotaur IV rocket is expected to make a mid-year visit for an Air Force mission, reviving long-dormant Launch Complex 46.

Most of the remainder counts on a banner year from SpaceX, which hopes to resume Falcon 9 launches this month and to debut the long-awaited Falcon Heavy, which will become the world's most powerful rocket.

Those flights will attempt to land the Falcon 9 boosters at sea or, in some cases, on pads at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

SpaceX likely will have two Cape launch pads available for at least part of the year.

The company could make its first flight from historic pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center as soon as Jan. 26, and plans to repair Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which was severely damaged when a Falcon 9 exploded on its launch pad during a Sept. 1 test.

The explosion limited the number of local launches last year, which also had been projected to exceed 30. SpaceX ended up with eight, its most yet in a calendar year.

Launch totals often fall short of projections at the start of the year, as technical issues arise with rockets or spacecraft, or weather events like Hurricane Matthew disrupt plans.

The schedule Jackim presented on Tuesday included a NASA science mission that the agency on the same day confirmed would be delayed to 2018.

The public schedule does not include classified tests of submarine-launched Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, of which there were five last year.

But all indications point to a growing number of launches from Florida over the next five years, as the Cape welcomes newcomers like Blue Origin.

The private firm founded by billionaire Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos hopes to launch an orbital New Glenn rocket before the end of the decade.

Rocket, satellite factories to rise at Exploration Park in 2017
State financing of 'space-bound' equipment is a first
The company is building a huge rocket factory at Kennedy Space Center's Exploration Park, and recently began work at its future launch site, Launch Complex 36 on the Air Force Station.

Several more companies are developing rockets that eventually could make their way to Space Coast pads or runways. Examples include Rocket Lab, Stratolaunch Systems and Virgin Galactic.

""It is really busy down here,"" said Jackim. ""And I'm not so sure that the rest of the space community has caught on to that yet.""

Jackim said the Air Force is transforming the Range to be ready to support up to 48 launches annually by 2021.

""We think that that might even be short of what we're going to need when we start to get weekly launches out of here, and maybe even bi-weekly as we start to get human spaceflight back into the launch calendar,"" he said.

Prior to Jackim's talk, the space club presented its 2017 Forrest S. McCartney National Defense Space Award to Capt. Joseph Dechert, a flight mission lead for the 5th Space Launch Squadron at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station."
2438674497,"Late next year, NASA is hoping to launch its Space Launch System-a powerful next generation rocket capable of exerting two million pounds of thrust. NASA engineers have now completed construction of a stand sturdy enough to test its enormous fuel tank. It's an important milestone, and another step towards sending humans to Mars.

Construction on test stand 4693 began in May 2014 and finished in December 2016. The structure stands 221 feet (67 meters) tall, and is located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. To commemorate the end of the major construction phase, NASA released a 60-second timelapse showing the platform as it was being built.

Engineers are now installing the equipment needed to test the rocket's biggest fuel tank, including cables, pipes, valves, control systems, cameras, lighting, and specially-designed test equipment. This test site will be critical in ensuring that the SLS's 537,000-gallon liquid hydrogen tank can withstand the extreme forces it'll have to endure during launch. This tank is part of the SLS's massive four-engine core stage, which is slated to send the Orion spacecraft and its four occupants on a journey around the moon. Importantly, it's the same technology needed for the journey to Mars.

""The scale and capability of this test stand are unique, and creating it has taken people from across the country, from all walks of life-concrete suppliers and finishers, steel fabricators and erectors, bolt manufacturers and more,"" noted Robert Bobo, manager of the SLS structural strength testing at Marshall, in a statement. ""Everyone who's touching this is proud of the Space Launch System, an American rocket that will send astronauts farther in space than humans have ever traveled before.""

The new stand is designed to simulate the powerful dynamics of launch and flight by pushing, pulling, and bending a prototype of the 149-foot-long liquid hydrogen tank, which was recently constructed by Boeing at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. This tank is so big and heavy that it'll have to be delivered to the test site on a barge. Once mounted on the stand, the liquid hydrogen tank, along with a liquid oxygen tank, will feed 733,000 gallons of super-cooled propellant to four RS-25 engines, producing 2 million pounds of thrust at the base of the core stage.

A total of 38 hydraulic cylinders, ranging in weight from 500 to 3,200 pounds, will be positioned at points along the tank to simulate the thrust produced by the RS-25 engines. During testing, these cylinders will extend and retract, pushing and pulling in different combinations to expose the hydrogen tank to the conditions expected at launch. These cylinders, or ""loadlines,"" are capable of applying millions of pounds of both pulling and crushing force, and up to 340,000 pounds of shearing (or sideways) force. As this is happening, more than 3,500 individual measurements will be taken, including temperatures and pressures. Over 30 different tests are scheduled in a process that'll take several months.

Lastly, the new stand will be equipped with high-definition cameras, so get ready from some really cool visuals once testing begins later this year!"
2438733000,"Overwatch fever has taken over, at least in the Musk household. You'd think that between SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk doesn't have much spare time on his hands, but he apparently has enough to play some video games here and there. In a new interview, Musk talks about what he's currently playing, and discusses some of his favorite games from the past as well.

When asked by Y Combination's Sam Altman about the games he'd recommend, Musk immediately responds with Overwatch. ""Overwatch is amazing; generally Blizzard does great stuff,"" he said, before going on to say that Hearthstone is also a favorite for him and his kids.

When Altman tried to end the interview, Musk continued to talk about video games, asking him if he played anything besides Overwatch. The discussion then shifted to Deus Ex, with Musk lamenting the fact that the latest entry in the series, Mankind Divided, was not up to snuff in terms of storytelling. He then talked about his love for the original Deus Ex game, which is a title that is renowned for its storytelling to this day.

In fact, Musk spent some time talking about the good old days, when graphics and sound in video weren't that great and developers had to rely on good storytelling instead. He certainly has a point, though there are some games that still offer great stories. As Altman points out, The Last of Us is one such game, with the behind the scenes staff recommending the Uncharted series to Musk as well.

If nothing else, this is an interesting insight into how Musk likes to spend his free time. Maybe a few of us have even played against him in an Overwatch match? The only question left is which character he likes the most, but if I had to guess, I'd say Winston - the scientist gorilla who wields a Tesla cannon - might be a safe bet."
2438790850,"NEW YORK - President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday issued yet another threat to impose stiff, new taxes on businesses that try to move jobs and factories ""from all these places I won, for good reason,"" to other countries like Mexico.

""That's not going to happen anymore,"" Trump said during a press conference at Trump Tower, again touting Carrier, which pledged to keep 1,000 jobs here that it initially planned to move abroad. For those companies that do shift their work overseas, however, Trump said: ""There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.""

In recent weeks, Trump has been ""meeting with a lot of companies,"" including international players like SoftBank, which owns Sprint, and Alibaba, a Chinese conglomerate whose chief visited Trump Tower on Monday. A week earlier, Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, huddled with Steve Bannon, one of Trump's top advisers, in New York City.

In some cases, companies have allowed Trump to take credit for recent jobs and hiring announcements. SoftBank, for one, had announced plans to invest $100 billion in the United States well before meeting with the president-elect. But some corporate behemoths are fighting back: After Trump claimed credit for a move by Fiat Chrysler to build a plant in Michigan, a spokesman said the carmaker's plans were in the works and had been for a long period of time.

Trump still called attention to the Fiat news during his press conference Wednesday."
2438806764,"Orbital ATK's next Cygnus cargo delivery mission to the International Space Station for NASA will lift off on March 16, NASA officials said Tuesday (Jan. 10). 

A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket will launch the unmanned Cygnus spacecraft's OA-7 resupply mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. 

""Orbital ATK will launch Cygnus atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket for delivery of essential crew supplies, equipment and scientific experiments to astronauts aboard the International Space Station,"" NASA officials wrote in a statement. ""The 30 minute launch window opens at 12:29 a.m. EDT."" 

In November, Orbital ATK announced that this upcoming Cygnus cargo mission would launch on a ULA Atlas V rocket - and not Orbital ATK's own Antares rocket - in order to maximize the amount of supplies delivered to the International Space Station, as well as maintain the company's launch schedule. Future Cygnus flights will launch on Orbital ATK's Antares rockets from the company's launch site on Wallops Island, Virginia.

Orbital ATK successfly returned its Antares rocket to flight on Oct. 17, nearly two years after a failed Cygnus launch in Oct. 2014. Between that Antares launch failure and the booster's return to flight, the company launched two Cygnus missions on Atlas V rockets, one December 2015 and the other in March 2016. 

Orbital ATK is one of two private companies (SpaceX is the other) currently flying cargo resupply missions for NASA. OA-7 is the seventh of 10 delivery missions for NASA that Orbital ATK is scheduled to launch under its current contract."
2438828217,"Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution to launch a 30-state tour of the United States in 2017 has led to speculation that he is weighing a future in elective office. ""After a tumultuous last year,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post, ""my hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future.""

Zuckerberg's commitment to step outside the Silicon Valley bubble represents an important moment for CEO leadership. More than half, 77% of voters in Santa Clara, the county that comprises Silicon Valley, voted for Hillary Clinton. Rather than retrench further into the Bay Area's bastion of progressivism, Zuckerberg understands that the future of his company - and in no small part the future of America - hinges on the willingness of our corporate leaders to understand and engage with the millions of Americans who aren't visible in their daily lives. The 2016 election demonstrated that Americans increasingly live in siloes, listening primarily to people who have similar backgrounds and perspectives. Facebook, with its near-ubiquity in the United States and 1.8 billion global users, can be a major part of the solution.

Importantly, Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, will join him on the 30-state tour, which indicates that this is about both his role as CEO and the couple's emerging role as titans of philanthropy and social investment. Indeed, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative has the potential in the coming decades to be one of the great philanthropic organizations, along with the Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Ford Foundation.

Zuckerberg's tour will give him a chance to learn and lead. If orchestrated thoughtfully, it could echo Robert F. Kennedy's famous 1968 campaign tour across Eastern Kentucky, in which he sought to better understand anyone who wished to share their hopes and fears, ideas and anxieties. The tour can inspire Zuckerberg to build products and services that make life better for the broadest number of people.

The tour may have echoes of a political campaign, but Zuckerberg actually doesn't need elected office to help unite our fractured nation. We are entering the ""Age of the CEO Statesman,"" a major shift in American political culture in which corporate executives have the opportunity to leverage their impact to push for social change, and in which people will increasingly look to executives, alongside political leaders, as change agents.

With the federal government running low on both the funds and the political will to do the big things necessary to compete in the 21st century - such as broadening access to jobs and opportunity, catalyzing entrepreneurship and providing access to capital - private sector leaders have an opportunity, and an obligation, to fill the void.

The private sector has already stepped up to fulfill many of the responsibilities that used to fall on government. Pharmaceutical and technology companies are investing heavily in research and development to fill the gap where federally-funded research no longer suffices. Major government functions, including some aspects of our national defense, are now privately outsourced. Even space travel, which half a century ago was the ultimate symbol of the U.S. government's commitment to conquering new frontiers, is now largely led by companies like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.

In the Age of the CEO Statesman, skeptics will look warily at the shift in influence from the governments to the private sector. A healthy dose of skepticism is warranted, and there is no guarantee that every company will use its newfound influence optimally. But here's the good news: just as the opportunity for influence is rising in the private sector, so too is the platform that consumers have to influence corporate decision making.

Social media gives everyone direct access to the CEOs of major companies. When consumers don't like a product or policy, they can speak with a loud voice. And when enough people take a side, companies are increasingly forced to listen and rethink their decisions. As much of this communication between consumers and companies takes place on social media, the CEO of the world's largest social platform must be especially focused on this trend.

The relationship between the newly-empowered company and the newly-empowered consumer is embryonic and evolving quickly. To some executives, the fear of a viral social media uprising in response to a new policy is ulcer-inducing. But to others, the possibility of connecting with people in a more meaningful way and achieving double bottom line success is a game-changer.

Zuckerberg's leadership of Facebook will face a number of tests in 2017, from his continued response to the fake news controversy to questions about the limits of speech and expression on the platform, particularly the emerging Facebook Live tool. His U.S. tour will be a fascinating case study in his willingness to listen and his capacity to lead. How he shares his learnings - and whether he adapts his corporate and philanthropic efforts based on what he hears - will be one of the most compelling stories of 2017. If he is successful, expect others to follow his lead.

2438830518,"Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao was in front of a senate committee seeking to confirm her nomination on Wednesday, fielding a number of questions about the future of the FAA, rail transit and more.

Chao also addressed questions and concerns around tech innovation in transportation, specifically touching on autonomous vehicles, connected infrastructure, drones and more.

In initial statements, Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-SD) noted that the next U.S. Secretary of Transportation would have ""a unique opportunity to show federal leadership in the advancement of transportation innovation,"" with specific influence in areas like vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) tech, self-driving vehicles, and drones or UAVs.

Chao identified ""a failure to pace with emerging technologies"" as a big reason why the U.S. transportation system, including both ground- and air-based transit, is facing a potential risk of falling behind. She said that while ""first and foremost, safety will continue to be the primary objective"" in setting an agenda for advancement of transportation efforts, she also will seek to identify and remove unnecessary bottlenecks preventing the use of new technologies coming to market that could increase safety and efficiency.

On the infrastructure side, Chao expressed a desire to ""unleash the potential"" for private investment in federal transportation infrastructure projects, which basically means she's open to making it easier for private companies to participate in broad public works projects designed to move the needle on transportation networks.

""[P]ublic-private partnerships,"" Chao said, will enable the U.S. to ""take full advantage of the estimated trillions in capital that equity firms, pension funds, and endowments can invest,"" noting that ""we all know that the government doesn't have the resources to deliver it all.""

Addressing autonomous vehicles, including passenger cars and commercial trucks, as well as drones and their potential tremendous commercial impact, Chao noted that the ""federal role is still very much in its infancy,"" and said that going forward, the aim is to position that role ""as a catalyst for safe, efficient technologies,"" rather than as ""an impediment"" for the implementation of the same. This should definitely buoy the hopes of private companies working to bring autonomous driving and drone tech to market, and indeed those companies have already signaled enthusiasm for the choice of Chao as DOT leader.

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 11: Elaine Chao arrives for her confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. secretary of transportation before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill January 11, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/)

Chao said ensuring the ability of these technological improvements to flourish is key to ""strengthening [U.S.] competitiveness"" and ""improving quality of life,"" and noted that while there are lots of concerns remaining, her intent is to ""work to address them"" but in a way that ""will not dampen basic innovation and creativity.""

In response to a question from Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), Chao said that she's ""very open"" to working with the auto industry on autonomous vehicle technology. Asked specifically about how she views the issue of technology outpacing regulation and the pace of government, she provided the following answer to Peters:

What we are seeing is obviously technology outstripping the consumer ability to accept and understand the technology. It behoves all of us, as a country and as a society, to bring greater familiarity and greater comfort, for passengers and other stakeholders who will be eventual users of this technology, to understand the benefits, the limitations and also what it means going forward in the future, so it requires a national discussion, and i look forward to doing that with you.

Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) asked about drones, noting that regulation has appeared to hamper the progress of drone tech's impact on commerce. Again, Chao signaled a desire to spark a broader, national conversation about where the U.S. wants drone tech to lead:

The drone started out at the Department of Defense, it's an emerging technology, there are those who see the benefits of commercializing them for various uses, it's transforming the way we work, the way we do commerce. There are also those who are very concerned about privacy issues, security issues, and again for going forward with an emerging technology as important as this with such vast implications for our future, I think we need to talk about it, we need to have again a national consensus for where we're going. State-by-state patchwork is of concern, and what does that mean for federal regulation, so i look forward to working with the committee and also with congress on this issue.

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 11: Freshmen members of the Senate Sen. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) (L) and Sen. Catherine Cortez Mastro (D-NV) prepare for the Senate Committee's confirmation hearing for Elaine Chao to be the next U.S. secretary of transportation. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/)

Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) also concluded her statements saying she hopes Chao will help ensure that as autonomous driving tech becomes available, it's also accessible to those who, for whatever reason, have no access to driving a car, either due to preventative health conditions or cost, to which Chao responded that this was a ""very good point"" she'll keep in mind.

In terms of existing smart transportation initiatives, Colorado is actually fairly far along (they hosted the first commercial driverless delivery via semi-truck earlier this year). Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) asked about smart transportaton, and ensuring that there is no ""onerous adoption"" of regulations at the federal level to block this kind of tech from ""thriving,"" and specifically about how federal concerns should work with state agencies.

""Always in collaboration,"" Chao answered, ""The Federal government can't do this on its own and it must take into account the perspective of the stakeholders, so we look forward to working with you on all these concerns."" Chao also added that regulations need to be based on ""sound science"" and ""real data"" to help ensure that they don't come down as overly burdensome to efforts to advance innovation.

Delphi's autonomous Audi demonstration vehicle is one car testing on Nevada's roads.

Chao also committed to make a visit to Nevada to check out what the state is doing to take leadership in autonomous driving technology, when asked to do so by Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). Nevada has committed state resources to development of autonomous tech, and played host to a number of public road self-driving vehicle technologies just last week at the annual CES tech conference.

On climate change issues, Tom Udall (D-NM) asked whether Chao's Department of Transportation will work to address greenhouse gasses and the results of climate change, noting the previous administration's work to do the same. Trump has mostly indicated a skeptical stance on climate change, but Chao avoided a firm answer, noting instead that she was ""not briefed"" on this particular subject currently and would have to revisit it later.

Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) wanted to know Chao's thoughts on connected vehicles and privacy. Automobiles increasingly represent a hacking risk, and cars also gather more information about us and our movement patterns than ever before, though connectivity and on-board sensors. Markey asked what role the government should have in protecting said data and citizens from potential breaches.

The innovation and creativity of our country is unsurpassed int he world, and so we have a responsibility to ensure that that creativity and that innovation remains. Obviously, with these new emerging technologies, there has now surfaced a number of key issues, privacy among them, that are very worrisome to a whole host of people. Safety is another. As these emerging technologies are coming up, they're faced with state-by-state regulations, which also present a new challenge as well. Yet there are many benefits, for senior citizens who may not want to drive, autonomous vehicles are a way to give them back their freedom. So there are pros and cons, and we need to have a national dialogue about all of this. And as I said, the regulations at the federal level are in their infancy, and we need to work with members of the congress and all of you on this committee to make sure that we're not dampening this creativity, and yet we're also assuaging the real deep-seated concerns that so much of our public - many of our public - on some of the issues that these new emerging technologies bring.

Markey also asked about commercial drones, and data collection, which allows companies currently to collect data about individuals fairly unrestricted under current laws. He asked about what role the Department of Transportation should be playing in ensuring drones don't compromise individual privacy rights. Chao essentially responded that as with other emerging tech issues, this requires a full and frank discussion about the benefits and drawbacks to their implementation at the national level.

Mercedes-Benz's drone van is one example of how UAVs might push towards greater commercialized use.

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) posed a question about commercial space exploration, which impacts young tech companies including SpaceX and Blue Origin. He noted that Secretary Foxx's exit memo doesn't even mention commercial space, and asked if Chao would you support moving commercial space concerns back under the DOT, and also be open to creating an environment where commercial space would thrive? Chao replied simply that she wasn't briefed on this issue previously, and would look forward to working with Cruz once she was up to speed.

With a background including a stint as the Secretary of Labor, and as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, under President George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush respectively, Chao is one of the most well-qualified and experienced candidates among Trump's selections for cabinet positions. Chao, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taipei, Taiwan at age 8, has also acted as the President and CEO of the U.S. branch of the United Way, and has held numerous corporate and not-for-profit board director positions. Chao's husband is Mitch McConnell (R-KY), current Senate majority leader.

Mobility tech service providers like Uber and Lyft have also celebrated Trump's choice of Chao, with spokespeople for both companies articulating their support of her selection when it was originally made public in November.

2438942055,"As part of the process to gain federal approval for the simultaneous landing of its Falcon Heavy rocket boosters in Florida, SpaceX has prepared an environmental assessment of the construction of two additional landing pads alongside its existing site. The report considers noise and other effects from landing up to three first stages at the same time. After undergoing a preliminary review by the US Air Force, the document has been released for public comment.

First reported by NASASpaceFlight.com, the document offers some interesting details about the proposed launch and landing of SpaceX's heavy lift rocket, which the company hopes to fly for the first time in the spring or early summer of 2017. After previously demonstrating the ability to land a single Falcon 9 booster, SpaceX also hopes to land the three first-stage boosters that will power the Falcon Heavy for potential re-use.

The company states this reusability as its rationale for the new construction-reducing the cost of access to space. ""This purpose continues to support SpaceX's overall missions for NASA and the USAF,"" the document states. ""The action continues to fulfill the U.S. expectation that space transportation costs are reduced in order to make continued exploration, development, and use of space more affordable.""

As part of the document, SpaceX also says it would like to build a Dragon capsule processing facility on the landing zone to support refurbishment of the Dragon 2 spacecraft, designed to carry crew into orbit. The 130-foot-long facility would provide a ""temporary"" facility for vehicle propellant load and propulsion system servicing.

When it originally designed its Landing Zone 1 facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, for the single Falcon 9 first stage booster, the company envisioned the need for one main pad approximately 200 feet across, and four smaller contingency pads, each approximately 150 feet in diameter. The chosen site had enough acreage to accommodate all five pads.

Improvements in the rocket's landing navigation guidance system obviated the need for the contingency pads with the Falcon 9, however. So now the company wants to use the additional space to construct two concrete landing pads, each with an approximate diameter of 282 feet surrounded by an approximate 50-foot-wide hard-packed soil ""apron."" This would give SpaceX three landing pads and the ability to bring back all three Falcon Heavy boosters to land while also retaining the option to land one or two on drone ships in the Atlantic Ocean.

In addition to the potential for a dozen Falcon 9 launches and landings each year, the document says SpaceX may eventually make six Falcon Heavy launches a year, potentially returning an additional 18 boosters to the Florida-based site. The new pads and crane sites would be configured to allow parallel processing of landed boosters. With US Air Force Approval, construction could begin as early as this spring.

If approval for the expansion of the landing zone is not granted after public comments, SpaceX indicated that it would still launch the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Florida, but only a single booster would return to Landing Zone 1. ""The remaining Falcon Heavy boosters would either fall into the Atlantic Ocean downrange or land on the droneship,"" the document says. ""SpaceX's ability to fully meet the National Space Transportation Policy goals of providing low-cost reliable access to and from space would be negatively affected. Therefore, this alternative is not preferred."""

2439015887,"NASA has selected two robotic missions to visit asteroids in the early 2020s from a field of proposed interplanetary probes, approving projects to explore a metallic relic from the early solar system and a half-dozen so-called Trojan objects left over from the formation of the outer planets.

The Lucy and Psyche spacecraft will join NASA's line of cost-capped Discovery missions, a program under which the agency's Mars Pathfinder rover, the Messenger mission to orbit Mercury, and the Dawn probe currently orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres were developed, built and launched.

Picked from a slate of 28 proposals submitted to NASA in 2015, Lucy and Psyche will visit worlds never before seen close-up as scientists seek to sort out the violent early history of the solar system, in which proto-planets coalesced from mergers and collisions between rocks and boulders in a disk around the sun.

Lucy will launch in October 2021 on a preliminary trajectory to escape the bonds of Earth's gravity, then return for flybys to use the planet's gravity to slingshot toward the mission's targets in the asteroid belt and beyond.

The probe's first destination in April 2025 will be the asteroid DonaldJohanson, named for the paleoanthropologist who discovered the fossil of Lucy, a human ancestor whose partial skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The Lucy spacecraft will then head as far as 500 million miles (800 million kilometers) from the sun on a series of high-speed passes through groups of Trojan asteroids, primitive worlds trapped by Jupiter's gravity in swarms ahead of and behind the giant planet's path.

Lucy will fly by at least six Trojan asteroids at close range from August 2027 through March 2033, the first time a spacecraft has visited a member of the Trojan population, which some scientists estimate may number in the hundreds of thousands of objects.

""Lucy is a flyby mission,"" said Harold Levison, the mission's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. ""Lucy fits in with NASA's history of exploration - first you do flybys, then you do rendezvous and then you do landings. In our case, in order to cover the diversity that we need to cover, we need to move quickly through the Trojan swarms to cover a lot of real estate, and that means that we're doing flybys only.""

The Jupiter Trojans may hold clues about the evolution of the solar system, especially the outer planets and the formation of Jupiter and its moons, scientists said. The frozen mini-worlds could be time capsules, keeping the characteristics they had more than 4 billion years ago, before scientists believe the immense pull of Jupiter's gravity trapped them in their current locations.

Because of their distance from Earth, fragments from the Jupiter Trojans have never fallen to the ground as meteorites, robbing scientists of any insight into their history and make-up.

""These objects are totally unknown,"" Levison said. ""Not only are they unknown because we've never really visited them with a spacecraft, unlike almost every other small body population in the solar system, these objects do not contribute to the meteorite record on Earth. Comets, main belt asteroids, near-Earth asteroids, all are contributing, but not Trojans because of their proximity to Jupiter's orbit.""

The Psyche mission, named for its destination, will depart Earth in October 2023. Its trajectory will take the spacecraft on gravity assist flybys around Earth and Mars in 2024 and 2025, then to the asteroid Psyche in 2030, where the probe will enter orbit for at least 12 months of detailed measurements and observations.

""Psyche is a small world that's made entirely of iron-nickel metal,"" said Linda Elkins-Tanton, the Psyche mission's principal investigator from Arizona State University. ""Humankind has visited rocky worlds, and icy worlds, and worlds made of gas, but we have never seen a metal world. Psyche has never been visited or had a picture taken that was more than a point of light, so it's apperance remains a mystery. This mission will be true exploration and discovery.""

Asteroid Psyche resides in the outer part of the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, with an average distance of around 270 million miles (430 million kilometers) from the sun, three times farther than the Earth. Telescopic observations indicate Psyche is about 186 miles (300 kilometers) in diameter, but its topography and shape remain a mystery.

Astronomical observations show that Psyche's metallic composition is much like Earth's super-dense, super-heated inner core, an environmental unreachable by humans or modern research tools.

""We think that Psyche is the metal core of a small planet that was destroyed in the high-energy, high-speed first one-one hundredth of the age of our solar system,"" Elkins-Tanton said. ""By visiting Psyche, we can literally visit a planetary core the only way that humankind ever can.""

The Lucy and Psyche missions come with strict cost constraints imposed by NASA.

The space agency's cost cap for the missions is $450 million each, a figure that does not include launch costs.

Levison said the Lucy spacecraft will be built by Lockheed Martin in Denver and will be based on the company's design of previous interplanetary probes, most recently the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission launched in September 2016.

Space Systems/Loral of Palo Alto, California, will manufacture the Psyche spacecraft with a suite of ion thrusters to steer the probe toward its destination. Based on the company's 1300-series design for commercial communications satellites, Psyche is the first spacecraft SSL will build for a NASA Discovery-class interplanetary mission.

Lucy will fly with conventional chemical rocket thrusters, relying primarily on gravity assists to bend its trajectory toward the Trojan swarms, Levison said.

To be managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, respectively, Lucy and Psyche came out on top in NASA's evaluation of five finalists culled from a list of 28 initial proposals submitted to the agency in early 2015.

The winning missions beat out two robotic probes that would have flown to Venus - an orbiter with a radar mapping instrument and a craft that would have studied Venus's atmosphere during an hour-long parachute-assisted descent.

A fifth finalist was called NEOCam, an observatory planned to search for asteroids that could threaten Earth. While NASA did not approve NEOCam for full development, officials plan to continue funding the mission's team at JPL for at least another year, aiming to reduce risk and keep the project alive for a possible future selection.

NASA picks Discovery missions in competitions among scientists with interests in the planets, asteroids, comets. Researchers are charged with assembling broad scientific and industrial teams that include developers of science instruments, spacecraft builders and project management experts.

""In that competition, we're looking for top science, top scientific implementation, and minimizing our technical risk,"" said Jim Green, director of NASA's planetary science division. ""Each of the principal investigators have a cost cap they must be able to stay under. All these factors are folded into a comprehensive evaluation.

""It would be wonderful if we could have selected more than two, but of course, obviously we're delighted with the two selections, and our ability to move forward with two,"" Green said during the Jan. 4 announcement of Lucy and Psyche. ""Our budget in the past hasn't enabled us to always do that.""

Green on Jan. 11 told NASA's Small Bodies Assessment Group, a committee of scientists specializing in research on asteroids, comets and dwarf planets, that the launch dates for Lucy and Psyche are staggered to fit within the agency's planetary science budget and based on orbital mechanics.

""These are the two that were the most technically ready, with top science,"" Green said.

""One of the charges we gave them was to look for optimal launch windows,"" he said. ""That gives us the greatest flexibility to make a selection of two, where we have staggered launch windows.""

Lucy will get a head start on its development, with its launch date set for October 2021. Psyche will follow a couple of years later.

NASA has typically picked just one Discovery mission during each competition.

The last Discovery competition resulted in the approval of the InSight Mars lander in August 2012, with a target launch date in March 2016. InSight's seismic research mission to the Martian surface has been delayed due to technical issues, with launch now scheduled in May 2018.

NASA is trying to reduce the time between Discovery-class missions, after the National Research Council recommended the agency mount competitions every two years, close to the cadence achieved earlier in the Discovery program in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

But NASA's planetary science funding waned over the last decade, and the agency's relatively low-cost Discovery program suffered. More costly flagship-level science missions like the Curiosity rover also took up a large slice of NASA's remaining planetary science budget.

Green said NASA's current budget allows for a new Discovery competition within three years, down from the four-and-a-half years between the selections of InSight and Lucy and Psyche.

""The administration and Congress have approved a healthy program that can't quite get us to 24 months, but gets it now closer to 32-36 months,"" Green said Jan. 11."

2439421602,"Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who donated more than a million dollars to President-elect Donald Trump's campaign and serves on his transition team, would not accept a job in the incoming administration if offered one, he told the New York Times.

""Confirm,"" Thiel said in an interview published Wednesday when asked if it's true that there is no administration job that could lure him to Washington. ""I want to stay involved in Silicon Valley and help Mr. Trump as I can without a full-time position.""

While the PayPal co-founder has said he would not join the White House in an official capacity, he has played an active role in Trump's transition process, most notably arranging a Trump Tower meeting last month between the president-elect and some of the nation's most prominent tech executives, including Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX and Tesla, both attended as well despite their criticism of Trump during the campaign.

Thiel also spoke at the Republican National Convention last July, discussing during his remarks that he is gay, a first for the GOP event. The billionaire told the Times that he drew more criticism from the liberal gay community than from Christians for speaking at the RNC and that overall, ""Trump is very good on gay rights."" The president-elect is unlikely to reverse any of the progress the gay community has made in recent years, Thiel said, adding that he would ""obviously be concerned if I thought otherwise.""

Throughout his campaign, but especially during the Republican primary, Trump campaigned hard on his promise to ban temporarily Muslims from entering the U.S., a position he has since backed away from. Executives from multiple tech companies have preemptively said that they would not assist the Trump administration in the creation of any Muslim registry system.

Asked if the data-mining company he helped found would be willing to help the Trump administration build such a registry, Thiel told the Times: ""We would not do that."""
2439422311,"According to simulations, more than half of the planets in the Milky Way are rogues that fly through space unattached to a star.

In about 60 per cent of encounters with our solar system, they would be flung out into space, the research suggests.

But in every other case, the rogues would end up ensnared in the Sun's gravitational field, potentially ejecting native planets from the solar system.

That's according to research conducted by James Vesper, an undergraduate at New Mexico State University and his mentor Paul Mason, a math and physical science professor. 

In a press conference at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Texas, Vesper said ""it's very plausible"" that Planet Nine is a captured rogue, Space.com reported.

His simulations suggest that it's unlikely the solar system has ever encountered a rogue world more massive than Neptune, as such an intruder would have caused chaos in the orderly inner solar system.

Neptune is 17 times more massive than Earth, while Planet Nine is believed to be just 10 times larger.

But not everyone is convinced that Planet Nine is rogue. Previous studies claim that it's a native of the solar system.

And at the moment, the planet is just hypothetical, although some astronomers think it's existence will be discovered by the end of winter next year.

Last summer, researchers at Warwick predicted that if the planet does is exist, it will ultimately cause chaos, rewriting the death of the solar system.

2439494246,"After the historic Apollo Missions, which saw humans set foot on another celestial body for the first time in history, NASA and the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) began to shift their priorities away from pioneering space exploration and began to focus on developing long-term capabilities in space. In the ensuing decades (from the 1970s to 1990s), both agencies began to build and deploy space stations, each one bigger and more complex than the last.

The latest and greatest of these is the International Space Station (ISS), a scientific facility that resides in Low-Earth Orbit around our planet. This space station is the largest and most sophisticated orbiting research facility ever built, and is so large that it can actually be seen with the naked eye. Central to its mission is the idea of fostering international cooperation for the sake of advancing science and space exploration.

Origin:
Planning for the ISS began in the 1980s and was based in part on the successes of Russia's Mir space station, NASA's Skylab, and the Space Shuttle Program. This station, it was hoped, would allow for the future utilization of low-Earth Orbit and its resources, and serve as an intermediate base for renewed exploration efforts to the Moon, mission to Mars, and beyond.

In May of 1982, NASA established the Space Station task force, which was charged with created a conceptual framework for such a space station. In the end, the ISS plan that emerged was a culmination of several different plans for a space station - which included NASA's Freedom and the Soviet's Mir-2 concepts, as well as Japan's Kibo laboratory, and the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory.

The Freedom concept called for a modular space station to be deployed to orbit, where it would serve as the counterpart to the Soviet Salyut and Mir space stations. That same year, NASA approached the Japanese Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) to participate in the program with the creation of the Kibo, also known as the Japanese Experiment Module.

The Canadian Space Agency was similarly approached in 1982 and was asked to provide robotic support for the station. Thanks to the success of the Canadarm, which was an integral part of the Space Shuttle Program, the CSA agreed to develop robotic components that would assist with docking, perform maintenance, and assist astronauts with spacewalks.

In 1984, the ESA was invited to participate in the construction of the station with the creation of the Columbus laboratory - a research and experimental lab specializing in materials science. Construction of both Kibo and Columbus were approved of in 1985. As the most ambitious space program in either agency's history, the development of these laboratories was seen as central to Europe and Japan's emerging space capability.

In 1993, American Vice-President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced that they would be pooling resources intended to create Freedom and Mir-2. Instead of two separate space stations, the programs would be working collaboratively to create a single space station - which was later named the International Space Station.

Construction:
Construction of the ISS was made possible with support from multiple federal space agencies, which included NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, the CSA, and members of the ESA - specifically Belgium, Denmark, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Sweden. The Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) also contributed to the construction effort.

The in-space construction of the space station began in 1998 after the participated nations signed the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), which established a legal framework that stressed cooperation based on international law. The participating space agencies also signed the Four Memoranda of Understandings (MoUs), which laid out their responsibilities in the design, development and use of the station.

The assembly process began in 1998 with the deployment of the 'Zarya' (""Sunrise"" in Russian) Control Module, or Functional Cargo Block. Built by the Russians with funding from the US, this module was designed to provide the station's initial propulsion and power. The pressurized module - which weighed over 19,3oo kg (42,600 pounds) - was launched aboard a Russian Proton rocket in November 1998.

On Dec. 4th, the second component - the 'Unity' Node - was placed into orbit by the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-88), along with two pressurized mating adapters. This node was one of three - Harmony and Tranquility being the other two - that would form the ISS' main hull. On Sunday, Dec. 6th, it was mated to Zarya by the STS-88 crew inside the shuttle's payload bay.

The next installments came in the year 2000, with the deployment of the Zvezda Service Module (the first habitation module) and multiple supply missions conducted by the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-92) also delivered the stations third pressurized mating adapted and a Ku-band antenna in October. By the end of the month, the first Expedition crew was launched aboard a Soyuz rocket, which arrived on Nov. 2nd.

In 2001, the 'Destiny' Laboratory Module and the 'Pirs' Docking Compartment were delivered. The modular racks that are part of Destiny were also shipped using the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistic Modules (MPLM) aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, and put into place using the Canadarm2 robotic arm. 2002 saw additional racks, truss segments, solar arrays, and the Mobile Base System for the Station's Mobile Servicing System being delivered.

In 2007, the European Harmony module was installed, which allowed for the addition of the Columbus laboratory and the Kibo laboratory - both of which were added in 2008. Between 2009 and 2011, construction was finalized with the addition of the Russian Mini-Research Module-1 and -2 (MRM2), the 'Tranquility' Node, the Cupola Observation Module, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module , and the Robonaut 2.

No additional modules or components were added until 2016, when Bigelow Aersopace installed their experimental Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM). All told, it took 13 years to construct the space station, an estimated $100 billion, and required more than 100 rocket and Space Shuttle launches, and 160 spacewalks.

As of the penning of this article, the station has been continuously occupied for a period of 16 years and 74 days since the arrival of Expedition 1 on November 2nd, 2000. This is the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, having surpassed Mir's record of 9 years and 357 days.

Purpose and Aims:
The main purpose of the ISS is fourfold: conducting scientific research, furthering space exploration, facilitating education and outreach, and fostering international cooperation. These goals are backed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscomos), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and the European Space Agency (ESA), with participation from other nations and institutions.

As far as scientific research goes, the ISS provides a unique environment to conduct experiments under microgravity conditions. Whereas crewed spacecraft provide a limited platform which are only deployed to space for a limited amount of time, the ISS allows for long-term studies that can last for years (or even decades).

Many different and continuous projects are being conducted aboard the ISS, which are made possible with the support of a full-time crew of six astronauts, and a continuity of visiting vehicles (which also allows for resupply and crew rotations). Scientists on Earth have access to their data, and are able to communicate with the science teams through a number of channels.

The many fields of research conducted aboard the ISS include astrobiology, astronomy, human research, life sciences, physical sciences, space weather, and meteorology. In the case of space weather and meteorology, the ISS is in a unique position to study these phenomena because it's position in LEO. Here, it has a short orbital period, allowing it to witness global weather patterns in a relatively short period of time.

It is also exposed to things like cosmic rays, solar wind, charged subatomic particles, and other phenomena that characterized a space environment. Medical research aboard the ISS is largely focused on the long-term effects of microgravity on living organisms - particularly its effects on bone density, muscle degeneration and organ function - which is intrinsic to long-range space exploration missions.

The ISS also conducts research that is beneficial to space exploration systems. It's location in LEO also allows for the testing of spacecraft systems that are required for long-range missions. It also provides an environment where astronauts can gain vital experience in terms of operations, maintenance and repair services - which are similarly crucial for long-term missions (such as mission to the Moon and Mars).

The ISS also provides opportunities for educational institutions through student participation in experiments. Here, students are able to design experiments and watch as ISS crews carry them out. ISS astronauts are also able to engage classrooms through video link, radio communications, email, and educational videos/web episodes. Various space agencies also maintain educational materials for download based on ISS experiments and operations.

Educational and cultural outreach also fall within the ISS' mandate. These activities are conducted with the help and support of the participating federal space agencies, and which are designed to encourage education and career training in the STEM (Science, Technical, Engineering, Math) fields.

One of the best known example of this are the education videos created by Chris Hadfield - the Canadian astronaut who served as the commander of Expedition 35 aboard the ISS - which chronicled the everyday activities of ISS astronauts. He also directed a great deal of attention to ISS activities thanks to his musical collaboration with the Barenaked Ladies and Wexford Gleeks - ""I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing)"".

His video, a cover of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"", also earned him acclaim, in part because it was the only music video ever to be filmed in space.

Operations Aboard the ISS:
As noted, the ISS is facilitated by rotating crews and regular launches that transport supplies, experiments and equipment to the station. These take the form of both crewed and uncrewed vehicles, depending on the nature of the mission. Crews are generally transported aboard Russian Progress spacecraft, which are launched via Soyuz rockets from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Roscosmos has conducted a total of 60 trips to the ISS using Progress spacecraft, while 40 seperate launches were conducted using Soyuz rockets. Some 35 flights were also made to the station using the retired NASA Space Shuttles, which transported crew, experiments and supplies. The ESA and JAXA have both conducted 5 cargo transfer missions, using the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), respectively.

In more recent years, private aerospace companies like Space X and Orbital ATK have been contracted to provide resupply missions to the ISS, which they have done using their Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft. Additional craft, such as SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, are expected to provide crew transportation in the future.

Alongside the development of reusable first stage rockets, these efforts are being carried out in part to restore domestic launch capability to the US. Since 2014, tensions between the Russia and the US over the Ukraine have also led to growing concerns over the future of Russian-American cooperation with programs like the ISS.

Crew activities consist of conducting experiments and research considered vital to space exploration. These activities are scheduled from 06:00 to 21:30 hours UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), with breaks being taken for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and regular crew conferences. Every crew member has their own quarters (which includes a tethered sleeping bag), two of which are located in the Zvezda Module and four more installed in Harmony.

During ""night hours"", the windows are covered at to give the impression of darkness. This is essential since the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. Two exercise periods of 1 hour each are scheduled every day to ensure that the risks of muscle atrophy and bone loss are minimized. The exercise equipment includes two treadmills, the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED) for simulated weight training, and a stationary bicycle.

Hygiene is maintained thanks to water jets and soap dispensed from tubes, as well as wet wipes, rinseless shampoo, and edible toothpaste. Sanitation is provided by two space toilers - both of Russian design - aboard the Zvezda and Tranquility Modules. Similar to what available aboard the Space Shuttle, astronauts fasten themselves to the toilet seat and removal of waste is accomplished with a vacuum suction hole.

Liquid waste is transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it is converted back into drinking water (yes, astronauts drink their own urine!) Solid waste is collected in individual bags that are stored in an aluminum container, which are then transferred to the docked spacecraft for disposal.

Food aboard the station, consists mainly of freeze-dried meals in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Canned goods are available, but are limited due to them being heavier and more expensive to transport. Fresh fruit and vegetables are often brought during resupply missions, and a large array of spices and condiments are used to ensure that food is flavorful - which is especially important since one of the effects of microgravity is a diminished sense of taste.

To prevent spillage, drinks and soups are contained in packets and consumed with a straw. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork, which are attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away, while drinks are provided in dehydrated powder form and then mixed with water. Any food or crumbs that floats away must be collected to prevent it from clogging the air filters and other equipment.

Hazards:
Life aboard the station also carries with it a high degree of risk. These come in the form of radiation, the long-term effects of microgravity on human physique, the psychological effects of being in space (i.e. stress and sleep disturbances), and the danger of collision with space debris.

In terms of radiation, objects within the Low-Earth orbit environment are partially protected from solar radiation and cosmic rays by the Earth's magnetosphere. However, without the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, astronauts are still exposed to about 1 millisievert a day, which is the equivalent of what a person on Earth is exposed to during the course of a year.

As a result, astronauts are at higher risk for developing cancer, suffering DNA and chromosomal damage, and diminished immune system function. Hence why protective shielding and drugs are a must aboard the station, as well as protocols for limiting exposure. For instance, during solar flare activity, crews are able to seek shelter in the more heavily shielded Russian Orbital Segment of the station.

As already noted, the effects of microgravity also take a toll on muscle tissues and bone density. According to a 2001 study conducted by NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) - which researched the effects on an astronaut Scott Kelly's body after he spent a year aboard the International Space Station - bone density loss occurs at a rate of over 1% per month.

Similarly, a report by the Johnson Space Center - titled ""Muscle Atrophy"" - stated that astronauts experience up to a 20 percent loss of muscle mass on spaceflights lasting just five to 11 days. In addition, more recent studies have indicated that the long-term effects of being in space also include diminished organ function, decreased metabolism, and reduced eyesight.

Because of this, astronauts exercise regularly in order to minimize muscle and bone the loss, and their nutritional regimen is designed to make sure they the appropriate nutrients to maintain proper organ function. Beyond that, the long-term health effects, and additional strategies to combat them, are still being investigated.

But perhaps the greatest hazard comes in the form of orbiting junk - aka. space debris. At present, there are over 500,000 pieces of debris that are being tracked by NASA and other agencies as they orbit the Earth. An estimated 20,000 of these are larger than a softball, while the remainder are about the size of a pebble. All told, there are likely to be many millions of pieces of debris in orbit, but most are so small they can't be tracked.

These objects can travel at speeds of up to 28,163 km/h (17,500 mph), while the ISS orbits the Earth at a speed of 27,600 km/h (17,200 mph). As a result, a collision with one of these objects could be catastrophic to the ISS. That stations is naturally shielded to withstand impacts from tiny bits of debris and well as micro-meteoroids - and this shielding is divided between the Russian Orbital Segment and the US Orbital Segment.

On the USOS, the shielding consists of a thin aluminium sheet that is held apart from the hull. This sheet causes objects to shatter into a cloud before reaching the main hull, thereby spreading the kinetic energy of the impact. On the ROS, shielding takes the form of a carbon plastic honeycomb screen held, an aluminium honeycomb screen, and glass cloth, all of which are spaced over the hull.

The ROS' shielding is less likely to be punctured, hence why the crew move to the ROS whenever a more serious threat presents itself. But when faced with the possibility of an impact from a larger object that is being tracked, the station performs what is known as a Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre (DAM). In this event, the thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment fire in order to alter the station's orbital altitude, thus avoiding the debris.

Future of the ISS:
Given its reliance on international cooperation, there has been concern in recent years - and in response to growing tensions between Russia, the United States and NATO - about the future of the International Space Station. However, for the time being, operations aboard the station seem secure, thanks to commitments made by all of the major partners.

In January of 2014, the Obama Administration announced that it would be extending funding for the US portion of the station until 2024. Roscosmos has endorsed this extension, but has also voiced approval for a plan that would use elements of the Russian Orbital Segment to construct a new Russian space station.

Known as the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex (OPSEK), the proposed station would serve as an assembly platform for crewed spacecraft traveling to the Moon, Mars, and the outer Solar System. There has also been tentative announcements made by Russian officials about a possible collaborative effort to build a future replacement for the ISS. However, NASA has yet to confirm these plans.

In April of 2015, the Canadian government approved a budget which included funding to ensure the CSA's participation with the ISS through to 2024. In December of 2015, JAXA and NASA announced their plans for a new cooperative framework for the International Space Station (ISS), which included Japan extending its participation until 2024. As of December 2016, the ESA has also committed to extending its mission to 2024.

The ISS represents one of the greatest collaborative and international efforts in history, not to mention one of the greatest scientific undertaking. In addition to providing a location for crucial scientific experiments that cannot be conducted here on Earth, it is also conducting research that will help humanity to make its next greatest leaps in space - i.e. mission to Mars and beyond!

On top of all that, it has been a source of inspiration for countless millions who one day dream of going into space! Who knows what great undertakings it will allow for before it is finally decommissioned - most likely decades from now?

2439532522,"Amazon is getting in the mix of US companies promoting their efforts to create more US jobs.

The e-commerce giant said Thursday it plans to create 100,000 new full-time, full-benefit jobs in the country over the next 18 months, expanding its US workforce to 280,000 -- up 56 percent from 2016.

While that's a huge number, many of these new jobs were expected. The company already revealed plans to create new warehouses in Texas, California, Florida, New Jersey and other states, with thousands of employees slated to run those new facilities.

Amazon typically talks up its plans for new warehouses around the country, but the latest announcement appears tailor-made for President-elect Donald Trump, who has made US job creation a major issue of his platform and who takes office in eight days.

Since his election victory in November, Trump has pushed US companies to keep their jobs in the United States and threatened to levy tariffs on those that leave but sell their goods back into the country. Trump promoted Vice President-elect Mike Pence's work to keep more jobs in a Carrier plant in Indiana that was slated to move to Mexico. He also congratulated Ford for abandoning a plan to build a new factory in Mexico, instead investing more in Michigan.

So far, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos appears to have a testy relationship with the incoming president, having suggested Trump was eroding democracy ""on the edges"" by threatening to jail his political opponents. In late 2015, Trump also claimed Amazon wasn't paying its fair share of taxes, to which Bezos, who also founded the Blue Origin spacecraft company, jokingly offered to send Trump into outer space.

Despite those squabbles, Bezos did come to a meeting Trump held with major tech leaders last month.

It's unclear whether Thursday's announcement will help smooth over Trump's relationship with Bezos.

""The announcement was made after the president-elect met with heads of several other tech companies and urge them to keep their jobs and production inside the United States,"" Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, said on a call with media Thursday.

Amazon's push to increase jobs keeps up its rapid growth, aided by more people buying more stuff online. The company had 30,000 US employees in 2011, with that number exploding to 180,000 in just five years. That hiring binge stands in stark contrast to brick-and-mortar players, who've had to close stores and layoff workers as more customers migrate online.

Amazon said the new jobs will be available for all types of education and experience levels, from engineers to entry-level positions."
2439553046,"President-elect Donald Trump is going to have more US jobs to brag about.

On Thursday, Amazon ( AMZN ) said in a press release that it would create 100,000 full-time, full-benefit jobs in the US over the next 18 months. The company says these jobs will range from engineering and software development to entry-level fulfillment center positions. Amazon currently employs about 180,000 people in the US.

Notably, this announcement of added jobs to the US follows commentary from the company last year that in 2016, Amazon would add 26 new fulfillment centers in the US. In its release, Amazon said, ""many of the roles will be in new fulfillment centers that have been announced over the past several months.""

The company is, then, in essence re-announcing jobs it had already said it would create, which is the easiest way for a company to keep Donald Trump off its back in 2017 .

""These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley - they're in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,"" said Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO.

""We plan to add another 100,000 new Amazonians across the company over the next 18 months as we open new fulfillment centers, and continue to invent in areas like cloud technology, machine learning, and advanced logistics.""

Amazon's announcement does not mention Trump by name, but Bezos and Trump have history and in the wake of Trump's sporadic attacks on companies since the election, it seems Bezos wanted to get ahead of the curve.

At the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in October 2016 , Bezos said that Trump's talk during the campaign was eroding democracy.

""Trying to chill the media and threaten retribution isn't appropriate,"" said Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, which has been a consistent thorn in Trump's side.

""We have freedom of speech in this country. It's written in our Constitution. Except for our norms and behaviors, [the] Constitution is just a piece of paper. We are not a new democracy. It is inappropriate for a presidential candidate to erode it around the edges. They should be trying to burnish it - not erode it.""

And these comments came after a December 2015 tweet from Bezos said he would save Trump a seat on a Blue Origin rocket headed for space. Blue Origin is the privately-held rocketry company Bezos also owns.

That tweet came following pronouncements from Trump during the campaign that Amazon would have ""such problems"" were he to become president given Bezos' involvement with both Amazon and The Washington Post.

Following the election, however, Bezos congratulated Trump on Twitter , writing that, ""I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.""

2439587931,"NASA advisers are continuing to express concerns about a SpaceX fueling process known as ""load and go,"" in which chilled fuel is loaded onto the rocket just 30 minutes before a scheduled launch. This week the agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel strongly encouraged NASA top management to ""scrutinize"" this issue as part of an annual report on safety concerns in US spaceflight, which could have significant implications for the commercial crew program.

SpaceX has gained notoriety during the last 13 months for landing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on land, and at sea aboard an autonomous drone ship. One critical component to this success has been the use of a new fueling process that chills liquid oxygen to below -200° C, allowing more of this denser oxidizer to fit within the rocket's fuel tanks. The additional fuel has provided SpaceX the margin needed to fly its boosters back to Earth after they delivered their payloads into space, especially those bound for geostationary orbit.

Further Reading Four things SpaceX can do in 2017 to get its groove back

Because this super-chilled oxygen can warm quickly after it is loaded onto the rocket, SpaceX has adopted the ""load and go"" strategy. After implementing the new fueling process in December, 2015, SpaceX had been working toward using the same fueling methods when beginning crew flights to the International Space Station next year.

Despite SpaceX's early success with this fueling process, however, NASA had retained concerns about it as historically neither the crew nor any other personnel have been allowed in or near a booster during fueling operations. These concerns were magnified after the Sept. 1 accident when, during fueling of the Falcon 9's second stage for a prelaunch test, both the rocket and its satellite were lost in an explosion. (SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said the Dragon's launch abort system would have saved the astronauts, had this happened during a crewed mission).

In December the chairman of NASA's advisory committee on the space station, Gen. Thomas Stafford, expressed his panel's fears about the safety of load and go to the agency's senior management. ""There is a unanimous, and strong, feeling by the committee that scheduling the crew to be on board Dragon spacecraft prior to loading oxidizer into the rocket is contrary to booster safety criteria that has been in place for over 50 years, both in this country and internationally,"" Stafford wrote .

""Steep hill to climb""

Now the agency's overall safety panel (ASAP) has weighed in too, citing concerns about unknown unknowns with the new, dynamic fueling process. Although SpaceX finalized its investigation of the Sept. 1 mishap in earlier this month and plans a return-to-flight mission as early as Saturday , the aerospace panel is calling for a wider investigation.

""We believe that the focus of the investigation must not be solely to identify and fix the specific cause of this mishap,"" the report states. ""It must focus also on improving the understanding of how the system functions in the dynamic thermal environment associated with 'load and go' so that other previously unidentified hazards can be discovered. This is not a trivial effort. Despite testing at the component and sub-assembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment.""

Further Reading NASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019

The ASAP panel urged NASA to weigh the benefits of load and go with the ""large"" uncertainties and additional risk it entails. There is some evidence NASA's commercial crew program managers are doing just that. One official familiar with deliberations at Johnson Space Center told Ars, ""Prelaunch is a phase of flight that is scrutinized as much as any other with safety being our top priority. Load and go has had a great deal of interest within NASA a long time before last September's accident and any ASAP discussions.""

Another Houston source directly involved in the review said load and go operations for crewed Dragon flights were not yet entirely off the table, but the concept had a ""steep hill to climb"" to get NASA's acceptance.

NASA already faces some schedule pressure to get its commercial crew providers flying. Although it has bought Soyuz seats for US crew flights to the space station through 2018, further development delays with the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Dragon vehicles would require the purchase of additional seats in 2019. Politically this would be a bitter pill for the agency to swallow, after it has told Congress repeatedly that crew flights would probably begin from US soil by the end of 2017 and certainly in 2018."
2439606243,"A Google Titan drone. reader comments 8 Share this story

Alphabet's airborne broadband plans no longer include drones, as the company says balloons are a more promising delivery mechanism for bringing Internet access to remote and rural areas.

Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace in 2014 and began testing drones that could eventually be used to bring Internet connections to remote places. But the company quietly scrapped those plans nearly a year ago, 9to5Google reported yesterday . More than 50 employees were moved to other Alphabet projects.

""The team from Titan was brought into X in early 2016,"" Alphabet told 9to5Google. ""We ended our exploration of high-altitude UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] for Internet access shortly after. By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high-flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.""

When contacted by Ars today, Alphabet provided the same statement it gave 9to5Google but no further information.

Project Loon is the balloon initiative that Google began working on a few years ago . The idea is to create a network of balloons that can carry Internet signals from cell towers to users that otherwise wouldn't be within range. ""High-speed Internet is transmitted up to the nearest balloon from our telecommunications partner on the ground, relayed across the balloon network, and then back down to users on the ground,"" Alphabet says . ""We have demonstrated data transmission between balloons over 100km apart in the stratosphere and back down to people on the ground with connection speeds of up to 10Mbps, directly to their LTE phones.""

Alphabet has ""autolaunchers"" that can launch new balloons every 30 minutes. In test flights, balloons have stayed in the stratosphere for as long as 187 days.

Project Wing, meanwhile, uses drones but not for delivering Internet access. Instead, the Wing team aims to create "" a new commerce system "" using drones to deliver consumer products as well as emergency medicine. Google has also invested in SpaceX, which is building low-Earth orbit satellites for broadband.

The idea of drone-based broadband networks may not be dead just because Alphabet gave up on it. Facebook, for example, is working on solar-powered drones that might be able to deliver Internet service to remote areas. Although the Facebook drone's first test flight in June 2016 resulted in a landing accident in the face of heavy winds,

2439611107,"CAPE CANAVERAL - Critical operations were completed this morning by United Launch Alliance at Cape Canaveral to prepare two rockets for upcoming flights into space.

At the Vertical Integration Facility adjacent to Complex 41, the U.S. military's $1.2 billion SBIRS GEO Flight 3 spacecraft was hoisted atop its Atlas 5 booster for liftoff next Thursday.

And down the road at Complex 37, the Delta 4 rocket that will launch a military communications satellite March 8 was hydraulically erected on the pad to begin its pre-flight campaign.

The missions will be ULA's 46th and 47th conducted for the U.S. Air Force over the past decade.

The third Space Base Infrared Systems Geosynchronous Earth Orbit, or SBIRS GEO Flight 3, was delivered to the VIF for mating from the National Reconnaissance Office's Eastern Processing Facility at Cape Canaveral early today.

The craft was encapsulated in the Atlas 5 rocket's payload fairing on Jan. 7.

Crews used an overhead crane to lift the 10,000-pound satellite through the doorway and into the towering building for attachment to the Centaur upper stage.

The launch on Jan. 19 is scheduled during a 40-minute window opens at 7:46 p.m. EST (0046 GMT).

The Lockheed Martin-built craft will operate 22,300 miles above Earth and use its telescopic infrared vision to detect launching missiles and provide early warning to the threatened area.

""The satellite's successful delivery and encapsulation closes out a manufacturing process that Lockheed Martin has continued to streamline with each build, driving significant schedule and cost reductions into the SBIRS program,"" said David Sheridan, vice president of Lockheed Martin's Overhead Persistent Infrared systems mission area.

Meanwhile, the two-stage Delta 4 rocket was moved from its Horizontal Integration Facility to the launch pad yesterday and then raised vertically this morning, achieving the Launch Vehicle On Stand milestone.

It is scheduled to fly March 8 during a 121-minute window that opens at 6:35 p.m. EST (2335 GMT) to deploy the Wideband Global SATCOM 9 communications satellite.

In the coming days, four strap-on solid rocket boosters will be installed to the Delta 4's first stage. The payload will be attached in late February.

WGS 9 was built by Boeing for the U.S. military's worldwide communications network. But it was funding from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and New Zealand that paid for the satellite's construction as part of an international agreement.

The partner nations bought the satellite in exchange for access to the entire constellation, similar to the groundbreaking deal with Australia that paid for the construction and launch of WGS 6.

WGS 9 will join its sisters in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above Earth to provide voice, data and video relay to troops, aircraft, ships and aerial drones.

It carries the same upgrade as WGS 8 that nearly doubles its bandwidth as compared to earlier satellites in the series."
2439620056,"Washington (AFP) - Amazon Thursday announced plans to create 100,000 US jobs over the next 18 months, as President-elect Donald Trump presses the business world to boost activities on American soil.

The US tech and retail giant's plan to bring its American workforce to over 280,000 is the latest -- and largest -- of a string of job-creation plans unveiled as Trump prepares to take office on a promise to boost US jobs and curb outsourcing.

""These new job opportunities are for people all across the country and with all types of experience, education and skill levels -- from engineers and software developers to those seeking entry-level positions and on-the-job training,"" a statement from the tech giant said.

Amazon made no mention of the president-elect, but Team Trump swiftly took credit for the plan, coming on the heels of similar initiatives by Japan's SoftBank, Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier.

""The president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon,"" said spokesman Sean Spicer, noting that it followed a meeting in which Trump urged tech firms to keep jobs and production inside the United States.

Amazon said that ""many"" of the new jobs would be in new ""fulfillment centers"" or warehouses where goods are stored for consumer delivery.

""These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley -- they're in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,"" said Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos.

The world's largest retailer has often faced criticism over working conditions in its warehouses.

In Britain, Amazon has been assailed for its labor policies, particularly after it emerged that some of its workers were unable to cover the cost of their commute, and resorted to sleeping in tents outside the warehouse.

- 'Advanced logistics' -

The initiative comes with Amazon expanding from its origins as an online retailer to a diversified tech company offering streaming video and music, cloud computing, and home automation through its artificial intelligence program Alexa.

Bezos said new workers will be needed ""as we open new fulfillment centers, and continue to invent in areas like cloud technology, machine learning, and advanced logistics.""

Amazon's job creation move comes even as the firm invests in technology to allow for speedier deliveries, which could include automating some functions in its warehouses. It also has been laying out plans for delivery by drone, which in some cases could be fully automated.

The company boasted that it also helps stimulate jobs and the economy through its Amazon Marketplace, which allows people to sell goods over the online platform, and Amazon Flex, which allows people to drive and deliver on a part-time basis.

Bezos and Trump exchanged barbs during the 2016 presidential campaign but the Amazon founder was among technology executives who met the president-elect last month in New York.

During the campaign, Trump warned Amazon could have ""a huge antitrust problem"" and accused Bezos of using the Washington Post, which he owns, to work against him and to push policies that help Amazon avoid taxes.

Bezos, who also owns the private space firm Blue Origin and at one point offered Trump a seat to outer space, congratulated his fellow billionaire after the election, tweeting, ""I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success.""

2439671815,Spacewalk Friday. SpaceX launch Saturday. Always something to look forward to when you're a space flight fan. 🚀?😎? https://t.co/JJJphdXCoe
2439717101,"SpaceX's first return to active launch status could be only a few days away, as the payload from Iridium has been loaded on to the Falcon 9 rocket that's set to take it to space on January 14 if all goes well. The launch was postponed from a planned January 9 date on Sunday this week, due to prevailing weather conditions at the Vandenberg Air Force base launchpad.

The new window will provide an opportunity for SpaceX to perform its first launch since a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launchpad during preflight fueling on September 1, 2016. The cause of that explosion was found to be related to a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen storage tank, and SpaceX says that after completing its investigation its confident in steps it took to prevent the same thing from happening again, both with short-term fixes for existing hardware, and in manufacturing process changes for future rockets.

Iridium's satellites will be used to build a voice and data network, and 10 of them are included in the payload for this first mission back since the SpaceX accident. The rocket that exploded on the launchpad last September contained a satellite intended for use in Facebook's effort to bring internet access to underserved areas across Africa."
2439766933,"A classified National Reconnaissance Office satellite mission assigned last month to launch on an Orbital ATK Minotaur 1 rocket will take off from Wallops Island in Virginia by the end of 2018, a U.S. Air Force spokesperson confirmed Wednesday.

No information about the mission's purpose or its launch site were disclosed in an Air Force press release announcing the $29.2 million contract award last month. The mission is known as NROL-111.

The Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center responded Wednesday to questions about the contract submitted by Spaceflight Now on Dec. 8, the same day as the center's announcement.

An SMC spokesperson said that Orbital ATK, the company responsible for launching Minotaur rockets, has proposed launching the NROL-111 mission from Wallops Island, Virginia. The spokesperson said details about the satellite slated to fly on the NROL-111 mission are classified.

The terms of the contract allow for Orbital ATK to determine the timing of the launch, as long as it is within 24 months of the date of the contract award, the Air Force said.

The NROL-111 mission will be the 12th launch of a Minotaur 1 rocket since it debuted in 2000, and the sixth Minotaur 1 flight from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore. The commercially-operated Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport's pad 0B at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility is used for Minotaur missions from Virginia.

Pad 0B lies about a quarter-mile (400 meters) south of pad 0A, the base for Antares rocket launches to resupply the International Space Station.

The Minotaur 1 rocket can place around 880 pounds (400 kilograms) of payloads into a circular 500-mile-high (800-kilometer) orbit from Wallops, according to an Orbital ATK fact sheet.

The type of orbit targeted on the NROL-111 mission has not been released.

The four-stage Minotaur 1 rocket is comprised of the lower two rocket motors from decommissioned Minuteman nuclear missiles. Two commercially-produced solid-fueled Orion-class motors from Orbital ATK's Pegasus XL rocket make up the Minotaur 1's third and fourth stages.

The more powerful Minotaur 4, 5 and 6 rockets use larger first and second stage motors from retired Peacekeeper missiles to put heavier payloads into orbit.

Because the Minotaur rocket family relies on government-furnished rocket components, the launcher is restricted from competing for commercial missions, but it has carved a niche delivering small experimental satellites to orbit for the U.S. Defense Department.

The Air Force awarded the NROL-111 contract to Orbital ATK under the Orbital/Suborbital Program-3, or OSP-3, program, which offers Minotaur, Falcon and Athena launchers from Orbital ATK, SpaceX and Lockheed Martin for the military's small and medium-class satellites.

The OSP-3 program has two lanes, one for lighter satellites and one for medium-class missions. The contract vehicle excludes United Launch Alliance, which delivers most of the military's heavier, more costly spacecraft to orbit.

Since the Air Force selected the three launch providers for eligibility for OSP-3 launch contracts in 2012, the service has awarded two ""task orders"" to SpaceX, one for the Deep Space Climate Observatory, which launched on a Falcon 9 in February 2015, and another for the Space Test Program-2 mission with multiple satellites set to fly on a Falcon Heavy booster later this year.

The NROL-111 contract was the third such order under the OSP-3 program.

""Continued reliability of space vehicle delivery methods and affordable access to space for the National Reconnaissance Office is an essential forefront for space superiority. Utilizing the capability of the OSP-3 contract Lane 1 capability, immediately benefits our Department of Defense mission partners. The OSP-3 capability also holds great potential for SMC to provide assured access to space for future DoD missions,"" said Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, Air Force program executive officer for space and SMC commander."

2439859281,"SAN FRANCISCO - Rumors began circulating in December that two leaders in the small satellite Earth imaging field were on the brink of deal, when employees of Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Terra Bella began visiting the offices of San Francisco-based Planet. Although the two companies have not confirmed an agreement, Bloomberg reported Jan. 9 that Planet was in talks to acquire Terra Bella, the Mountain View, California company formerly known as Skybox Imaging.

Since that initial report was published, industry sources have provided additional details, saying for example that Planet would gain approximately 80 Terra Bella employees with expertise in spacecraft operations and data processing, and that Planet would move imagery processing from the Amazon Web Services to Google's Cloud Platform.

""Planet has no comment on unofficial reports of any deal,"" company spokeswoman Rachel Holm said by email. Terra Bella did not respond to requests for comment.

The reported deal comes as a surprise to some Earth imaging experts because Google's parent Alphabet acquired Skybox for about $500 million only two and a half years ago, saying the imagery would improve Google Maps and bolster its campaign to provide global Internet access. To investors, however, the move makes perfect sense because it would strengthen Planet's product portfolio.

""Historically, if you look at companies that have been able to build leadership positions, they've done that by building monopolistic positions,"" said Shahin Farshchi, partner at New York-based venture firm Lux Capital and an early investor in Planet. Farshchi said he had no knowledge of any Planet-Alphabet deal, but added that the companies' products are complementary.

With about 375 employees working in San Francisco, Berlin, Amsterdam, Bellevue, Washington and Lethbridge, Canada, Planet currently operates 61 Doves, the firm's five-kilogram cubesats, in addition to five 150-kilogram spacecraft the firm gained in 2015 when it acquired Blackbridge and its RapidEye constellation.

Terra Bella, a firm with about 125 employees has seven 100-kilogram satellites in orbit to provide high-resolution video and still imagery. In 2014, Skybox hired Space Systems Loral to build 13 satellites. Terra Bella plans to launch four satellites later this year on Orbital ATK's Minotaur-C rocket and additional spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket dedicated rideshare mission arranged by Spaceflight Industries.

Since it was founded in 2009, Planet has raised approximately $183 million, which brings the firm's valuation to roughly $1.1 billion.

""Planet is not just raising money at high valuation, it is also generating very healthy amounts of revenue,"" Farshchi said. ""It's showing you can build an interesting business as a private company in the space industry, which wasn't possible before unless you were a government contractor. This may give other people the confidence and courage to do more in space."""

2440126758,"Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday said it plans to create more than 100,000 full-time jobs in the U.S. within the next 18 months, leveraging plans already in the works to help mend its contentious relationship with President-elect Donald Trump.

The additional jobs would swell Amazon's U.S. workforce by more than half to 280,000. However, the online retail giant's rapid growth has kneecapped traditional retailers, including Macy's Inc. and Sears Holding Corp., resulting in store closures and thousands of lost jobs.

Amazon said many of its new positions will be at already-announced warehouses under construction in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Others will be in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning and advanced logistics -- some of which eliminate jobs, experts say.

""Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs,"" said Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.

A spokesman for Mr. Trump seemed to credit the president-elect with Amazon's hiring bump because he had urged the tech industry to keep jobs and production inside the U.S. at a meeting with heads of tech companies last month.

""The president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon,"" the spokesman said.

Amazon's announcement highlights a new reality for companies as Mr. Trump prepares to take office: His public praising or shaming of corporations for their business decisions is pressuring them to stay in his good graces and to adjust their public-relations strategies.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump made job creation a central message and blasted companies, including technology giants, for purportedly sending jobs overseas. Since his election, companies across a range of industries have scurried to announce plans to retain or add U.S. jobs.

Some, such as Carrier Corp. and Ford Motor Co., reversed existing initiatives to shift manufacturing abroad. Others trumpeted efforts that had been under way before November. In December, SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son met with Mr. Trump to say he would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 jobs -- money that would come from a fund he announced in October.

A few companies have held firm in the face of Mr. Trump's scolding, such as General Motors Co., which plans to increase the number of cars it ships from Mexico to sell in the U.S.

Jack Ma, chief executive of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., a Chinese competitor to Amazon, met with Mr. Trump on Monday and made a bold, if vague, promise to create new U.S. jobs by encouraging American businesses to sell to Chinese consumers.

In an echo of Mr. Ma's proposal, Amazon said additional jobs could be created indirectly for small sellers who offer their goods on Amazon's marketplace.

Rosy talk about jobs from companies doesn't mean they are truly shifting on when or whether they bring on new workers, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

""What [companies] are going to do first is spin,"" he said. That approach is ""just a whole lot easier to do than to actually change your real numbers,"" he added.

Companies are hedging against Mr. Trump's threats to punish businesses that move American jobs elsewhere, Prof. Cappelli said, and corporate leaders are concerned about potential policy changes.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's relationship with the tech industry was strained. Tech leaders overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Trump lambasted companies including Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.

The acrimony between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bezos was particularly charged. Mr. Trump accused Amazon's CEO of buying the Washington Post to influence politics. ""If I become president, oh do they have problems,"" Mr. Trump said in February. He called Amazon a ""no profit company"" in a tweet in December 2015. (Amazon had a profit of $482 million in the last quarter of 2015, but has a history of red ink as it poured money into its expansion, including new jobs.)

That same month, Mr. Bezos, who also runs closely held rocket-making company Blue Origin LLC, said he would reserve a seat on one of his rockets for Mr. Trump. ""#sendDonaldtospace,"" a message from Mr. Bezos' Twitter account read. Weeks before the election, Mr. Bezos said the Republican candidate's behavior ""erodes democracy around the edges.""

Amazon's share price was one of the hardest hit among tech firms in the days after Mr. Trump's election, tumbling 9% to as low as about $719 before recovering. On Thursday, the stock closed up 1.8% to $813.64.

Analysts were skeptical that Amazon's announcement Thursday reflected an acceleration of its hiring plans. ""There may be some 'political capital' involved with the timing and details,"" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.

Amazon's biggest source of jobs is its warehouses, which process and ship orders. Amazon opened about two dozen new warehouses in the third quarter of 2016, prompting costs to soar in part due to those investments, the company said. That brought its total number of warehouses globally to about 150.

Before the announcement Thursday, Amazon had been planning to open some 16 new fulfillment centers over the next few months, which would have created more than 15,000 jobs, according to data from supply-chain consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Marc Wulfraat, president of MWPVL, estimates another 20 warehouses could be announced this year, employing anywhere from about 300 to 6,000 people each.

To reach the 100,000 mark, Amazon is likely to convert some part-time jobs to full-time, Mr. Wulfraat said. There are also seasonal workers to pick from.

The rapid growth of Amazon and e-commerce in general has cost traditional retailers thousands of brick-and-mortar jobs.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to cut nearly 1,000 corporate positions before the end of January, according to a person familiar with the situation, after cutting about 7,000 back-office store jobs last year.

Last week, Macy's said it would slash more than 10,000 jobs and close dozens of stores."
2440191702,"@ChrisTrumpman (you have realized by now that you don't even have basic facts straight, right? Elon Musk founded SpaceX)."
2440235809,"WASHINGTON - A NASA safety board recommended in its annual report that the agency closely study the safety issues associated with SpaceX's fueling plans for Falcon 9 commercial crew missions.

The annual report by the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), released Jan. 11, raised the issue of what it calls the ""load and go"" approach planned by SpaceX to fuel the Falcon 9 rocket with liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants only after astronauts have boarded the Dragon spacecraft.

Traditionally, launch vehicles are fueled hours before launch, and only afterwards do crews board the spacecraft. However, SpaceX has shifted to an approach of fueling the rocket starting only about a half-hour before launch. That allows the company to use ""super-cooled"" liquid oxygen, which is denser and provides additional performance. However, it would require crews to board the Dragon prior to the start of fueling.

ASAP, in its report, noted that it is not clear how safe this approach is given the limited experience of the ""load and go"" approach. ""In this regard, the Panel is concerned that the dynamic thermal effects on the system associated with loading densified propellants may not be adequately understood, which results in a higher level of uncertainty that must be factored into the risk determination,"" it stated.

Another NASA advisory group, the International Space Station Advisory Committee, first raised concerns about the ""load and go"" approach in a December 2015 letter to NASA. The issue received new scrutiny when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the pad prior to a static-fire test Sept. 1 in advance of the scheduled launch of the Amos-6 communications satellite.

""There is a unanimous, and strong, feeling by the committee that scheduling the crew to be on board the Dragon spacecraft prior to loading oxidizer into the rocket is contrary to booster safety criteria that has been in place for over 50 years, both in this country and internationally,"" Stafford wrote in the letter, which NASA released in November.

Stafford raised the issue again at an Oct. 31 meeting of this committee, when he complained that NASA had not responded to his original letter, even after the pad accident. The agency, in a later statement, said it was still evaluating NASA's plans for fueling the Falcon 9 for commercial crew launches, and would incorporate the results of the pad explosion investigation into that analysis.

SpaceX announced Jan. 2 that it had completed the investigation into the explosion. It blamed the accident on buckling of the aluminum liner of a composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store helium in the rocket's upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Liquid oxygen pooled in the gap between the liner and the carbon overwrap, leading to friction and the subsequent failure of the pressure vessel. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses Falcon 9 commercial launches, said Jan. 6 it had accepted the results of that investigation and issued a launch license for SpaceX's next Falcon 9 launch of 10 Iridium satellites, now scheduled for Jan. 14.

ASAP, in its report, said it was concerned that there may be additional, unforeseen issues associated with the ""load and go"" fueling process. ""Despite testing at the component and subassembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment,"" the panel stated in the report. It called for NASA to better understand ""how the system functions in the dynamic thermal environment associated with 'load and go' so that other previously unidentified hazards can be discovered.""

Some former NASA astronauts remain skeptical of SpaceX's fueling approach. ""I am not a supporter of 'load and go'! 'Steep hill' for SpaceX to convince NASA of load and go's safety for crew,"" tweeted former astronaut Mike Foreman, a veteran of two shuttle missions, in response to the report Jan. 12.

""You are not alone,"" Clayton Anderson, another former astronaut, tweeted in response.

ASAP cited the ""load and go"" fueling approach by SpaceX, as well as a fault tolerance issue on the Centaur upper stage that will be used to launch Boeing's CST-100 commercial crew vehicle, as issues for NASA to watch for in the commercial crew program. That is complicated, the panel said, by the fact that the companies control the design of their commercial crew systems, with NASA providing oversight.

""In this type of environment, the [NASA commercial crew program] must work diligently to ensure that acceptable risk is not defined by 'the best we can do given the constraints,'"" the panel's report stated. ""The residual risk must be openly acknowledged and elevated to the appropriate level within the Agency for consideration."""

2440374133,"Tomorrow, SpaceX is hoping to get back to launching - and landing - its rockets again, a little over four months after one of its Falcon 9 vehicles exploded on a Florida launchpad. The company's vehicle is slated to take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 12:54PM ET , carrying 10 satellites into orbit for the communications company Iridium. And as is the norm with Falcon 9 launches these days, SpaceX will attempt to land the majority of the rocket upright on one of its drone ships in the Pacific Ocean following takeoff. But most of all, the launch itself needs to go smoothly if SpaceX wants to move forward and accomplish its many goals that lie ahead.

It'll be the first flight that SpaceX has attempted since August , since the company was forced to go on a hiatus from spaceflight after the September launchpad explosion in Cape Canaveral. The vehicle was being loaded with propellant in preparation for a static fire test - a routine procedure that SpaceX does prior to flight, in which the rocket engines are turned on while the vehicle is constrained. During this fueling process, the vehicle suddenly went up in a spectacular fireball , destroying the Falcon 9 and the Israeli Amos-6 satellite that it was supposed to carry into space just a few days later.

SpaceX has spent its time grounded trying to decipher what happened, finally coming up with an official cause for the explosion two weeks ago . The source of the failure originated within the rocket's upper liquid oxygen tank, which stores the vehicle's super chilled liquid oxygen propellant. Also housed inside this tank are three smaller tanks called composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVS. These vessels store cryogenic helium, which is needed to fill up and pressurize the liquid oxygen tank when the propellant is used up during flight. SpaceX determined that the materials making up the COPVs had a bad reaction with the liquid oxygen in the tank, ultimately causing the propellant to ignite.

With the official cause decided, SpaceX originally said it was aiming to return to flight on January 8th, but the launch was ultimately delayed until tomorrow due to rain and heavy winds this past week. The company conducted a static fire test of the Falcon 9 vehicle January 5th in preparation for the flight, and the company finally received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch and land its Falcon 9 vehicle for the upcoming mission. In fact, the FAA launch license gives SpaceX permission to launch the next seven rockets for the Iridium NEXT mission - an endeavor that will put 70 satellites into orbit for Iridium.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

The pressure is on for tomorrow's launch, since SpaceX's launch delays have had some important consequences. The company had to push back all of its launches last year, including the first flight of its Falcon Heavy - a larger heavy-lift vehicle that is essentially three Falcon 9 cores strapped together. SpaceX had also been planning to relaunch one of its landed rockets for the first time before the end of last year, a big milestone in its quest for reusability; that too had to be put on pause. The launch hiatus was also partially responsible for pushing one of SpaceX's customers, Inmarsat, to book a different rocket for one of its spacecraft. Plus, an exclusive report from The Wall Street Journal reveals that SpaceX experienced a $260 million annual loss following its previous rocket explosion in 2015, as well as a 6 percent loss in revenue. So the health of the business may also be a concern following last year's launchpad accident.

A successful launch tomorrow will be crucial for a company that has some very ambitious plans for the future. SpaceX is claiming the Falcon Heavy will finally fly this year . And with that launch, rumor is the company will attempt to land all three rocket cores after takeoff. Additionally, SpaceX has its obligations to NASA to worry about. The company has a contract to periodically send cargo to the International Space Station, and SpaceX vehicles are supposed to start sending people to the orbiting lab in 2018 .

Meanwhile, SpaceX is also forging ahead - albeit slowly - with its plans to start a colony on Mars some day . Last year, CEO Elon Musk detailed the designs for the company's future Mars colonization vehicles, and SpaceX has said that it plans to start sending spacecraft to Mars in 2018 .

With such a busy manifest, the next few years could prove to be pretty wild for SpaceX. While one of the company's launchpads at the Cape was badly damaged during the September accident, SpaceX has the option to continue launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, as well as a newly renovated pad at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Those two sites will allow SpaceX to get back to its launch schedule, which includes another satellite launch later this month and a cargo resupply mission for NASA tentatively scheduled for early February .

But first, it needs to make sure tomorrow's satellite launch goes smoothly. Up until now, weather hasn't been that cooperative, and the mission has to deal with an instantaneous launch window. The Iridium satellites need to get into a very particular polar orbit - a path around Earth that runs from pole to pole - so there's very little flexibility for when the Falcon 9 can get off the ground. That means there's only one shot tomorrow to get it right."
2440384175,"A privately held company, SpaceX has kept its finances largely shrouded from public view since its founding nearly 15 years ago. But now the Wall Street Journal has obtained financial documents that provide a revealing look at the company's successes-and struggles-as it has sought to remake the global launch industry this decade.

The report , which reviewed finances for the company from 2011 through 2015, shows SpaceX made a modest profit until its catastrophic accident in 2015, when a Falcon 9 rocket carrying supplies to the International Space Station exploded during its ascent to orbit. Despite revenues of nearly $1 billion in 2015, the company lost $260 million, the newspaper reported. Financial results for 2016, when SpaceX lost another rocket on the pad during a static fire test, were not available but are likely to be similarly grim.

Beyond the financial data, the documents also provide some detail about the plans company founder Elon Musk has for growth in his rocket launch business-and beyond. Musk, who still retains 54 percent of the company's ownership, has targeted 27 launches for 2017, and projects the company will launch 52 rockets by the year 2019.

Going for growth

This represents impressive growth considering the most rockets SpaceX has ever launched in a single year is eight, and even without the accidents, its best cadence has been about one launch per month. That launch rate doesn't seem impossible-provided that SpaceX has no more accidents. During the last three years the company has been constantly iterating the design of its Falcon 9 rocket to maximize its performance and been pushing the bounds of reusability with booster landings at sea and on land. After SpaceX settles on a final design for the Falcon 9, some increase in launch reliability and cadence seems plausible.

The documents also suggest Musk believes satellite Internet will prove a windfall for the company. Since Alphabet invested $1 billion in SpaceX in 2015, the rocket company has been working toward the launch of thousands of satellites that would provide Internet around the globe.

The newspaper reported that SpaceX eventually plans to launch 4,000 communications satellites, which would be dozens of times larger than any other constellation, with the first phase of this possibly going online as early as 2018. SpaceX anticipates that the satellite business will become more profitable than the rocket business by 2020, generating tens of billions of dollars by the mid-2020s.

As ever with SpaceX, the company's ambition is enormous. Whether it can begin to achieve these projections relies on a number of ifs-if SpaceX can return to flight this weekend, if it can launch on time and without further accidents, if it can develop the crew Dragon spacecraft, if it can refurbish and refly used first-stage boosters, and so on. And all of this is to say nothing of its ultimate aim, colonizing Mars. One thing is certain: when it comes to SpaceX, the company will be fun to follow."
2440394345,"SpaceX does good business when the rockets are flying-and becomes a money-loser when they're not, according to company financials published in the Wall Street Journal today (Jan. 13).

The behind-the-scenes peek at Elon Musk's privately held space business also reveals the company's hopes to generate enormous revenue from an ambitious effort to sell internet service from space.

The Journal reporters were able to access financial details from 2011 through 2015, the year that SpaceX suffered the loss of a rocket on a mission to the International Space Station. That incident put SpaceX deep into the red, as it was forced to delay launches for other clients until it decisively fixed the problem six months later.

The financials confirm the forthrightness of SpaceX CEO Musk, who told reporters shortly after the accident that it would entail losses of hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. Sure enough, the leaked financials reported a $250 million loss that year.

In response to the Journal story, SpaceX CFO Bret Johnson said the company had more than $10 billion in launch contracts on its manifest, $1 billion in cash on hand, and no debt.

SpaceX returned to flight in December 2015 and enjoyed nine months of successful launches until another incident in September, when one of its Falcon 9 rockets was destroyed during fueling before a routine engine test. The cause of the fire-a pressurized tank stressed by an innovative, super-cold fueling technique-was identified last week. SpaceX plans to return to flight tomorrow (Jan. 14) after returning to a more reliable fueling procedure.

The company's bullish projections for its satellite internet division are a highlight of the leaked documents. SpaceX expects revenue from the telecom project to exceed launch revenue by 2020, and to generate more than $15 billion in profit by 2025, the Journal reported.

SpaceX's plan to launch a constellation of some 1,600 satellites in the next six years to beam internet service back to earth has been mostly revealed through regulatory filings, though Musk was caught on tape at the opening of the company's satellite-focused office in Seattle saying that this satellite constellation ""is intended to generate a significant amount of revenue and help fund a city on Mars,"" the company's longest-term ambition.

But the company may have adjusted its projections since then. Musk did not include satellite business revenue as a source of funding to SpaceX during a major presentation of his Mars ambitions in September 2016, even when asked about its role by Quartz afterward. SpaceX had planned to launch two test satellites for its constellation in 2016, according to a regulatory filing, but the launch did not occur, perhaps because of the delays following the two Falcon 9 losses.

Other companies, including Boeing and OneWeb, which recently earned a $1 billion investment from Masayoshi Son's Softbank, are moving forward with their own plans for competing satellite internet constellations.

SpaceX is majority-owned by Musk himself, and valued by at least one of its private-equity investors, Fidelity, at slightly more than $16 billion. Fidelity led a round with Alphabet in January 2015 to invest $1 billion in the company, in connection with the satellite internet plans. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and DFJ Venture Capital also hold stakes in the firm.

SpaceX's ability to out-compete traditional aerospace businesses for launch contracts led it to small operating profits from 2011 and 2014, giving it the cash margin to push through its recent losses.

But this report underscores how important tomorrow's return-to-flight launch is to SpaceX's financial soundness, and its future.

"
2440445982,"A new report has lifted the curtain on SpaceX's finances and plans, showing past losses suffered and the company's big bet on satellite-based internet services.

Internal documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal and interviews with former SpaceX employees reveal the commercial space company suffered a $260 million loss in 2015, after a rocket bound for the International Space Station exploded after launch.

However, the company enjoyed profitable years in 2013 and 2014 after contracts from NASA and satellite companies pushed revenue from $680 million to $1 billion. The report also revealed the high hopes SpaceX has for a business using satellites to provide internet service, which so far is still in the planning stages.

The documents obtained by the Journal contain projections of 40 million subscribers and more than $30 billion in revenue for the satellite internet business by 2025.

The company signed a $468 million contract with SpaceX for seven total launches, with ten satellites each (it will put four backups into orbit), for complete global coverage.

The launches are pretty crucial for Iridium. The company had expected to have its Iridium NEXT fleet fully operational by 2018. However, SpaceX's investigation of last September's mishap pushed back that timeline. Now, Iridium is looking at 2019 being its first year with NEXT service, a delay that is costing the company tens of millions in annual revenue. As a result, last October, Iridium began renegotiating with the lenders who financed its NEXT project-which include the French government-for more flexible loan conditions.

Iridium isn't the only company with its bottom line on the line this Saturday. SpaceX had a year of superlatives in 2016, successfully landing four of its rockets on a droneship, and two more on terrestrial launchpads before the September 1 ""fast fire"" delayed the year's remaining launches-and derailed the company's plans to launch its much-anticipated Falcon Heavy, and relaunch one of its previously landed Falcon 9s.

SpaceX still has plenty of launches on its manifest-enough to keep it busy for a few years. So if this one doesn't go as planned, the biggest immediate damage will be to the company's reputation. But hopefully, the only explosion anyone will see on Saturday is the carefully engineered one coming out the business end of a Falcon 9, sending it safely into orbit."
2440570104,"As SpaceX prepares for its first Falcon 9 rocket launch in five months, a new report about the company's finances is pointing to the importance of getting back to routine operations - and the importance of SpaceX's satellite operation in the Seattle area.

Today's report in The Wall Street Journal is based on a look at the privately held company's internal financial documents. Those documents indicate that the company lost $260 million on revenues of nearly $1 billion in 2015. The main factor behind that loss was the schedule disruption caused by the breakup of a Falcon 9 shortly after liftoff in June of that year.

SpaceX traced the cause of that failure to a flawed helium tank strut , and resumed launches the following December . Over the months that followed, it succeeded in its strategy of landing Falcon first-stage boosters after launch and separation . But last September, a launch-pad failure forced another suspension of flights.

September's pre-launch explosion destroyed the Amos-6 telecommunications satellite and did heavy damage to the Florida launch pad. Just last week, SpaceX issued a report that blamed the blow-up on a helium tank failure and said it was changing its fueling procedures to head off further problems.

Now SpaceX has the go-ahead to launch 10 advanced Iridium Next telecommunications satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on a Falcon 9. Liftoff is scheduled for 9:54 a.m. PT Saturday, with sunny skies in the forecast. SpaceX will live-stream coverage of the countdown, launch and anticipated booster landing at sea.

The California-based company is anxious to get its launch schedule back on track. It has more than 70 launches stacked up, representing more than $10 billion in contracts. Those launches including cargo resupply flights to the International Space Station and the first liftoff of its Falcon Heavy rocket , which been repeatedly postponed over the course of four years.

A couple of launches have been shifted to other providers due to schedule concerns, but so far, SpaceX's customers have voiced strong support for the company. ""Our confidence in them is not shaken,"" Iridium's chief financial officer, Thomas Fitzpatrick, said after the mishap in September .

Over the past few years, SpaceX has revolutionized the launch industry by dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit. Its published price for a Falcon 9 launch is $62 million, which is just a little more than half the cost of a bare-bones Atlas 5 rocket launch .

SpaceX's chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, indicated that the company has weathered its recent setbacks thanks to its past successes - and deep pockets.

""With over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth,"" Johnsen said today in a statement.

The Journal's report suggests that one of the keys to that future growth will be a 4,425-satellite constellation that SpaceX plans to put into orbit to provide global internet access.

SpaceX's engineering office in Redmond, Wash., has a leading role in developing the satellite network. The company's schedule calls for the first wave of satellites to be deployed in the 2018-2020 time frame.

When SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced plans for the satellite operation during a Seattle visit in 2015, he said it would ""generate a significant amount of revenue, and help fund a city on Mars.""

The Journal's report suggests that Musk wasn't kidding. It cites documents anticipating that the satellite network would have more than 40 million subscribers and bring in more than $30 billion in annual revenue by 2025, which is just about when Musk expects to start sending settlers to the Red Planet.

The documents also indicate Musk owned 54 percent of SpaceX stock in 2015 and held 78 percent of the company's votes. Google's holding company, Alphabet, and Fidelity Investments have significant stakes in the company - and Fidelity's valuation of its stake suggests SpaceX is valued at $15 billion.

SpaceX isn't alone in setting its sights on sateliite internet services as a financial frontier: Another venture called OneWeb is planning to start deploying a similar network by 2019. Just last month, Japan-based SoftBank Group announced it would invest $1 billion in OneWeb , joining an array of global industrial heavyweights."
2440589139,"It's been four months since one of SpaceX's rockets exploded on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, but the company is ready to get back to business tomorrow. At 9:54 PT, it is launching another rocket set to carry 10 satellites into orbit on behalf of the communications company Iridium. 

SpaceX had to determine the cause of the explosion, then wait for approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to launch its next mission. Now, the world is watching to see how the launch of Falcon 9 will go, since its success will determine whether SpaceX can go through with its future plans, including a mission to Mars."
2440598382,"The Bangabandhu Satellite 1 program has successfully passed its Critical Design Review (CDR), which took place in Thales Alenia Space end of 2016. The Bangabandhu-1 (BD 1) satellite will be the first Bangladeshi geostationary communications satellite operated by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), which is scheduled to launch in 2017.

The program will now begin the production phase with the integration of the communications module in Thales Alenia Space plant in Toulouse, France and the service module in Cannes, with the mating set for March 2017. At the same time, the ground team is kicking off factory acceptance tests and starting local work on the installation of ground antennas.

In entirety, Bangabandhu is a satellite telecommunications system, comprising a satellite and the complete ground segment (control, mission and user segments). Thales Alenia Space is also in charge of building two facilities in Bangladesh for all ground support equipment needed to control the satellite and operate the telecom system. Thales Alenia Space Belgium , Thales Alenia Space Italy and Thales Alenia Space Spain are all involved in this project, as suppliers of various ground and satellite components. The launch service is also covered by the contract, and will be provided by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle."
2440611334,"2016 was a good year to be a tech startup in LA, and, with the $25 billion planned public offering for the city's startup darling, Snap Inc., coming up, the future's so bright entrepreneurs might want to wear... Spectacles.

Last year saw the city reap windfall exits from the acquisition of companies like Dollar Shave Club, and has a number of promising e-commerce companies waiting in the wings for their moment under the spotlights (looking at you Honest Co., Thrive Market, et al.).

It's been a constant refrain (especially from the indispensable LA-based venture investor, Mark Suster) that LA has arrived as one of the top startup markets in the U.S. Now the ecosystem is coming together under the auspices of showing off the opportunities that tech offers local job-seekers.

In roughly two weeks, LA is going to host what's being billed as its first major tech job fair, organized and co-hosted by none other than the city's mayor, Eric Garcetti, and serial entrepreneur Jason Nazar.

For Nazar, chief executive of the LA-based startup Comparably, the job fair is the culmination of his stint as an entrepreneur-in-residence for the mayor's office.

Launched by the mayor's office in 2014, the EIR program is one example of how Garcetti is looking to embrace tech as a key component of Los Angeles' future economic growth. It mirrors work that cities across the country have been doing to grow tech talent (check out Steve Case's excellent Rise of the Rest tours that showcase other places that are cultivating tech ecosystems).

""Over the last decade, I've seen Los Angeles become one of the most vibrant Tech communities in the world,"" says Nazar. ""TechFair LA is our opportunity to provide thousands of jobs, to deserving candidates, at the best companies you could ever want to work for.""

More than 150 of the top tech companies in LA - including Snap, Dollar Shave Club, Tinder, Honest, Cornerstone OnDemand, GumGum, Laurel & Wolf and Hyperloop One - will be there taking questions and recruiting new hires.

The range of the companies in attendance - from artificial intelligence developers like GumGum, to consumer-facing companies like Dollar Shave, Honest, Tinder and Snap, to next-generation transportation tech companies like Hyperloop One - point to the depth and breadth of LA's still-growing tech industry. Add to that mix companies like SpaceX (based in nearby Hawthorne) and you've got an incredible array of companies representing diverse industries and tremendous opportunity for the city.
""TechFair LA promises to be the tech community event of the year. A place where people in this world-changing industry will come to talk about new trends, to discuss new ideas, and to network with the leaders who are making it all happen,"" said Garcetti in a statement."
2440616879,"SpaceX lost money in 2015 because of a rocket explosion, according to internal documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal. The documents also show financial details of the satellite internet business SpaceX hopes to launch to fund its Mars mission.

The Journal reviewed SpaceX financial results and forecasts, which aren't publicly available, from 2011 to 2015. In general, the documents show that the company has huge goals, but isn't very close to living up to them. For example, an exploding Falcon 9 in June 2015 cost it $260 million that year, after two years of operating profit. That's because SpaceX is operating with a razor-thin margin, in order to undercut competitors' costs.

Elon Musk is used to dreaming big, and that's part of what makes SpaceX such an interesting company. But though Musk has managed to stoke everyone's imagination, he hasn't always delivered on his promises. He doesn't want to take his company public until the Mars mission is successful, which is supposed to happen by 2024. Then again, Musk promised in 2011 that he would put humans in space in three years; it is currently 2017 and no human being has yet flown on a SpaceX rocket. The money woes paint a picture of an increasingly tenuous business, one that's been disrupted by rocket malfunctions.

Contracts from both private companies and NASA helped revenue grow to $1 billion from $680 million from 2013 to 2014. But the 2015 explosion, along with various delays since, caused revenue to fall by 6 percent and created an annual loss of a quarter-billion dollars. Though the company still had $1.3 billion in cash at the end of 2015, it was generating less cash than was being invested in it.

The documents also give more insight into SpaceX's big plans for profitability: a satellite internet business the company projects will bring in more than $30 billion in revenue - and over 40 million subscribers - by 2025. Again, these projections seem optimistic; Comcast, for instance, made only $12 billion on its high-speed internet service in 2015.

The goal for the satellite project is to launch 4,000 communications satellites for global internet access. According to SpaceX projections, revenue from this business should overtake SpaceX's core launch division by 2020. By 2025, it's supposed to generate an operating profit between $15 billion and $20 billion. As of now, though, the business is still in planning stages and doesn't have a factory yet. The first phase was projected to go online by 2018.

For 2016, the company forecast that it would have $1.8 billion in revenue and $55 million in operating profit. Those numbers are based on 20 successful rocket launches; SpaceX had only eight last year, so it's unlikely the company met its financial goals. For 2017, the company plans to launch 27 missions; by 2019, SpaceX's goal is to launch a rocket each week. So far, the record for the highest number of annual SpaceX launches is eight rockets.

Finance isn't the only place where SpaceX isn't living up to its own expectations. SpaceX suffers from serious deadline dysfunction. It was supposed to work with NASA to ferry astronauts to the ISS by 2017, but then those plans got pushed back to late 2018. There have been delays of its Falcon Heavy mission, and the company lost a satellite launch order due to schedule delays.

SpaceX is an ambitious, exciting company. But the financials seem to confirm what we've been seeing from the outside: its goals might be a little too optimistic. SpaceX does seem to do what it says it does - just later than they first claimed."
2440620220,"Iridium Communications is finally set for its initial launch of 10 next-generation satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Saturday, the first batch in a $3 billion 72-satellite network that will replace the company's current fleet of aging low-Earth-orbit mobile voice and data relay stations.

The planned launching comes four-and-a-half months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the pad in Cape Canaveral during a pre-flight test Sept. 1 that destroyed the booster, a $200 million communications satellite and heavily damaged the launch pad. The spectacular failure was blamed on a high-pressure helium tank in the rocket's second stage that likely ruptured due to temperature-related issues.

SpaceX engineers have identified the most likely cause of the mishap and have implemented corrective actions. The company's return to flight -- and launch of the first batch of Iridium NEXT satellites -- is targeted for 9:54:39 a.m. PST (GMT-8; 12:54 p.m. EST) Saturday from complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

The stakes are high for both companies. For SpaceX, which has now lost two of 29 Falcon 9 rockets -- one in flight and one on the ground -- a successful mission will help restore confidence in the low-cost boosters and clear the way for a resumption of commercial and government launches that have been on hold since the September mishap.

""This will be a tough flight for us coming back after our event on Sept.1,"" Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and CEO, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It is actually a difficult flight, regardless of the return-to-flight element.""

For Iridium, the launch Saturday is the first step in a complex satellite-by-satellite swap out, part of a long-range effort to retire satellites that have operated long past their design life, replace them with upgraded, more capable spacecraft and expand the company's capabilities in an increasingly competitive commercial space operations environment.

""Frankly, it means our future, because we have to replace this network anyway,"" Iridium CEO Matthew Desch said in an interview with CBS News before the Sept. 1 Falcon mishap. ""I often think of it as one of the biggest tech refreshes in the world right now, with a new $3 billion constellation.""Iridium CEO Matthew Desch, holding one of the company's satellite telephones.

Iridium Communications

All together, Iridium is paying SpaceX upwards of $500 million for seven Falcon 9 launches to boost 70 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit, 10 at a time. Two more will be launched aboard a different rocket.

""Iridium's a great customer, we've been working with them for, my goodness, six years so far,"" Shotwell said. ""We have six more launches after this with 10 satellites each. So we'll basically be putting those 70 satellites into orbit, and that will form a network, a data network for the Iridium customers.""

Going into the long replacement operation, Desch said the first order of business is ""to do no harm to our 800-and-some-thousand current subscribers. So the new satellites do everything the old satellites did, but they do a whole lot more. It really gets us seriously into sort of broadband connections.""

Iridium currently operates a fleet of 66 operational satellites, along with spares, in six orbital planes at an altitude of 483 miles.

With each satellite able to communicate with up to four others -- one ahead, one behind and one to either side in adjacent orbital planes -- the Iridium system provides a global communications network that includes hand-held phones, machine-to-machine devices and ship- and aircraft-born data transmitters.

Thanks to software upgrades implemented well after launch, the first-generation satellites can relay voice and data at ISDN-class speeds, but the Iridium NEXT spacecraft will work at up to 1.4 megabits per second. While that might not impress a modern smartphone user, ""when you're in the middle of nowhere, or the cockpit of an airplane or you're on a ship, that's going to be a whole lot more performance,"" Desch said.

The new spacecraft also will carry circuitry provided by Harris Corp. to track ships at sea on a minute-by-minute basis and another Harris-built device, provided by a multi-agency consortium known as Aireon, that will track aircraft anywhere in the world.

""Each of those (Aireon) payloads can relay the position of commercial airliners in seconds to air traffic controllers, allowing airplanes to go more direct routes and burn less fuel and fly higher, faster,"" Desch said. ""That's kind of a billion-dollar business (that) has nothing to do, technically, with our core mission, but it's complementary in that there's no other satellite network in low-Earth orbit with inter-satellite links that could do that.""

Iridium NEXT satellites will play a major role in machine-to-machine data relay, he said, ""connecting trucks, cars, pipelines, stuff like that. We're the thing you go to if you're outside cellphone coverage, which is 90 percent of the world.""

""Today, we do that with a really small, low-cost device that can connect into hundreds of thousands of things (and) that really expands dramatically with Iridium NEXT because we can now take those speeds up, even with a tiny little low-cost antenna, tens of dollars, say up to about 100 kilobits per second, which really kind of changes the game there, too.""

The Falcon 9 carrying the first 10 Iridium NEXT satellites will release the spacecraft into a near-polar orbit tilted 86.4 degrees to the equator. They will all be in the same orbital plane, one of six used by the company to create its network.

The 1,896-pound solar-powered satellites, designed by the European aerospace giant Thales Alenia Space and mass produced assembly-line fashion by Orbital ATK in Arizona, each feature a phased-array antenna that can generate 48 beams over a footprint 3,000 miles across.

Each satellite also is equipped with high-speed links to ground stations and the required satellite-to-satellite cross links. It is those relay cross links that create a global network allowing users anywhere in the world to communicate cell phone fashion.

""The new satellites are a lot more powerful, a lot more processing power, they've got a lot more memory, a lot more capacity, they actually expand our ability to support customers,"" Desch said. And, he added, ""they're easier to operate.""

Once the first two Iridium NEXT satellites are released from a custom dispenser atop the Falcon 9's second stage, engineers will spend three months testing each one and carrying out a satellite-by-satellite swap out, moving a new spacecraft into position near the vehicle it's replacing and switching service from one to the other.

""There will be a moment in time where literally the constellation will drop the links to the old satellite (and) re-establish links to the new satellite, this happens literally in microseconds,"" Desch said. ""If you were an 'internet of things' customer and you were tracking that oil and gas pipeline, you'd have one data transmission and then the next transmission would go through the NEXT satellite.""

The next set of 10 satellites is believed to be scheduled for launch in April.

While 66 satellites are needed to complete the Iridium NEXT network, the company plans to eventually launch 15 in-orbit spares. The additional satellites will provide immediate backup in case of an in-orbit malfunction and serve as an insurance policy of sorts in the event of a launch failure.

""That's why we built 81 satellites,"" Desch said. ""We could have just paid more money to insurance companies and then when we lost (a launch) we would have gotten the satellite re-created. So we're doing a bit of self insurance, if you will.""

That will cover a single launch failure. Iridium has more traditional insurance to cover the possibility of a second failure.

The original Iridium satellites eventually will be de-orbited to burn up in Earth's atmosphere. And that will mark the end of an era for amateur satellite trackers who for years have enjoyed watching brilliant, easily seen and very predictable bursts of sunlight reflecting from a specific antenna on the first-generation satellites.

A variety of smartphone satellite tracking apps are available that tell users when Iridium ""flares"" will be visible from their location and flare watching has become a routine part of amateur satellite watching. But that will end with Iridium NEXT. The new satellites feature a different design, and flares are not expected.

"
2440620699,"SpaceX engineers are readying a powerful Falcon 9 rocket for a high-stakes return to flight Saturday, hoping to restore confidence in the low-cost booster after a spectacular launch pad explosion last September in Cape Canaveral. It was the company's second failure in a year and a half.

Carrying 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations, liftoff from pad 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles is targeted for 9:54:39 a.m. PST Saturday (GMT-8; 12:54 p.m. EST) Saturday.

If all goes well, the rocket's first stage will attempt an autonomous landing on an offshore droneship while the second stage continues the climb to orbit. SpaceX has completed four successful droneship landings off the East Coast and two on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The only other attempt to land a stage on a droneship after takeoff from Vandenberg ended in failure last January when one of the booster's four landing legs did not lock in place.

In any case, landing is a strictly secondary objective, part of company founder Elon Musk's drive to lower launch costs by eventually re-using rocket stages. The primary goal of the mission is to boost the Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit, the first of seven SpaceX flights over the next year or so to deploy 70 relay stations for Iridium's satellite telephone network.

While all rocket launches are critical to a company's bottom line, a successful return to flight Saturday is especially important to SpaceX after an in-flight failure in June 2015 and the dramatic on-pad explosion Sept. 1 at Cape Canaveral.

The Falcon 9's record of two failures in 29 rockets stands in contrast to the record of its major U.S. competitor, United Launch Alliance, which has launched 102 more expensive Atlas 5s and Delta 4s without a single failure. The European consortium Arianespace has successfully launched more than 75 Ariane 5s in a row.

""I have to be honest with you, every launch is a nerve-racking, significant emotional event,"" Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and CEO, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""But I think this flight will be a little more nerve-racking than normal.""

She said SpaceX currently has about 70 flights on its manifest, a backlog valued at some $10 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that a review of SpaceX documents and interviews with former employees shows the rocket builder lost $260 million in the wake of the 2015 in-flight failure, launching just six missions that year instead of 12 that were originally planned.

It's not known what impact the September failure might have on the company's bottom line or how delays will ripple through its manifest. SpaceX launched eight flights in 2016 and was forced to delay at least seven more.

But Shotwell said no customers have abandoned SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, SpaceX chief financial officer, said in a statement the company continues to enjoy ""strong customer relationships.""

""Furthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth,"" he said.

The dramatic explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on the launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station last September most likely was caused by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank in the booster's second stage liquid oxygen tank. SpaceX says it has implemented a variety of corrective measures to prevent another such failure.

USLaunchReport.com

The June 2015 failure, which destroyed a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station, was caused by a defective strut in the rocket's second stage liquid oxygen tank. When the strut failed, a tank supplying helium gas used to pressurize the oxygen broke free, triggering the breakup of the second stage.

SpaceX engineers, working with NASA, the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration, carried out an exhaustive investigation to find out what caused the Sept. 1 explosion in Florida and to identify corrective actions.

They determined the most probable cause was the failure of one of the three high-pressure helium tanks in the rocket's second stage oxygen tank.

""We learned a huge amount about the helium bottles,"" Shotwell told CBS This Morning. ""The failure ended up being quite subtle. We had to have a lot of test data and a lot of pretty high analysis to figure out what happened.""

The latest version of the Falcon 9, which debuted with the flight following the June 2015 failure, uses super-cooled, or ""densified,"" liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene fuel to provide additional performance during ascent.

Liquid oxygen normally has a temperature of around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit, but SpaceX chills the propellant to around minus 340 degrees for use aboard the Falcon 9. The RP-1 kerosene fuel, which normally is stored at a room temperature 70 degrees, also is chilled.

The lower temperatures increase the density of the liquids and allow more propellant to be loaded.

To push propellants to the rocket's engines, the Falcon 9 uses highly pressurized helium stored in aluminum bottles that are wrapped in a tough carbon composite material. The bottles, known as composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, are mounted inside the propellant tanks, submerged in the liquid oxygen and kerosene.

To achieve and maintain the desired low temperatures, propellant loading began just 35 minutes before launch.

On Sept. 1, about five minutes before a planned test firing of the Falcon's nine Merlin 1D first stage engines -- a routine pre-launch test for SpaceX -- the second stage suddenly exploded in a spectacular fireball that was caught on video and widely seen around the world.

The rocket and it's $200 million payload, a commercial communications satellite, were destroyed and launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was heavily damaged. Just 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first signs of trouble to the explosion.

Investigators believe oxygen likely got trapped in voids between a second stage helium tank's aluminum skin and its carbon composite overwrap. The extremely low temperatures in the oxygen tank may have caused some of the trapped oxygen to solidify.

In any case, the trapped oxygen pushing against the carbon overwrap likely generated friction ""leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV,"" SpaceX said in a statement.

Failure investigators ""identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solidified oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,"" the company said in its statement.

""The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.""

Shotwell said engineers ""learned the behavior of these bottles"" and ""we've modified the way we load the propellants on the rocket and helium.""

For the Iridium launch, kerosene fuel loading will begin an hour and 10 minutes before launch with oxygen loading beginning 45 minutes before liftoff. The company carried out a successful fueling and first stage engine test firing a week ago.

""We learned more about the hardware,"" Shotwell said, ""which is always good. Whenever you have a failure, it's a bigger failure if you don't learn from it and modify the operations and your technology going forward.""

When all is said and done, rocket launches are ""really hard. And the 5,000 or so people we have at SpaceX know it intimately,"" Shotwell said.

""A million things have to go right in order to have a successful launch, and only one thing has to go wrong to have a particularly bad day,"" she said. ""It's really hard, it is rocket science, and I'm sure all our customers feel that, too.""

"
2440642466,"SpaceX is in the business of launching rockets, but it will look to supplement that business through other revenue opportunities; specifically, it anticipates a global satellite internet business will drive as much as $30 billion in revenue per year by 2025. That's an ambitious target, but financials analyzed by The Wall Street Journal for the private company suggest that it's a key ingredient to help SpaceX shore up thin margins in its rocket launch device.

Those margins are feeling pressure from the pre-launch explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on a launchpad in September, 2016. That explosion not only destroyed a functional Falcon 9, but also a payload containing Facebook's $200 million satellite. SpaceX was already launching rockets at a fraction of the price of its competitors, which is why it's been able to build up a $10 billion contract buffer in terms of scheduled future launches - but in doing so, it's cutting pretty close to the quick in terms of profit potential.

That explosion also led to a four-month stoppage of any launches, which, given SpaceX's aggressive pace for sending things into space, has had a significant impact on its ability to make good on existing contracts and recoup revenue. And this follows a 2015 mid-flight explosion, which led to a roughly $260 million loss for that year, and a 6 percent overall drop in revenue, after small operating profits recorded in both 2013 and 2014. In 2016, it launched only eight rockets, versus its projected 20, which is bound to have a significant impact on its revenue for this most recent full calendar year, too.

SpaceX's $60 million average launch cost is key to its ability to continue to land contracts and attract customers, and it's also key to its larger goal of reaching Mars by 2024. That will require further cost reductions, which SpaceX hopes to achieve by reusing its rocket components and improving its manufacturing processes. But 2016 has definitely been a financial challenge, and it's unlikely the company hit its forecasts of $1.8 billion in revenue, and $55 million in operating profit, thanks to setbacks.

The plan the company has developed for launching satellite-based internet was revealed in more detail when SpaceX filed an application with the FCC to deploy 4,425 satellites in order to provide high-speed internet access world-wide. Each satellite is roughly the size of a sub-compact car. When completed, the network should be able to provide speeds of around 1 Gbps for subscribers on the ground, which is around the speed of current gigabit fiber optic networks, and much faster than most users with cable connections enjoy today.

SpaceX received a $1 billion investment from Google and Fidelity in 2015, and Alphabet also recently shut down its own Titan drone-based global internet deployment project, so the backing of Musk's plan might actually grow now that the Google parent is looking beyond its own drone project for ways to accomplish its goals of opening up global internet accessibility more broadly.

Still, SpaceX's financials, as revealed by The Wall Street Journal's rare backstage look, place a lot of faith in the ability of this global internet service to not only be up and running by 2018, but to create a lot of profit only a few years after that. A lot is riding on the company's planned return to active launch status on Saturday, but this puts those stakes in even starker relief."
2440649139,"SpaceX will return to launching rockets tomorrow for the first time since a Falcon 9 exploded on the launchpad during preflight fueling on September 1, 2016. Liftoff is scheduled for Saturday, January 14 at 12:54 p.m. ET, at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Tomorrow's Falcon 9 launch will carry 10 Iridium-NEXT satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO), the first 10 satellites of Iridium Communications' planned 66-satellite network that will provide communication and data services across the globe. The Falcon 9 will attempt a first-stage landing on the autonomous drone ship Just Read the Instructions out in the Pacific.

This is an important launch for SpaceX. Spaceflight enthusiasts around the world will be tuning in to watch the company that has, in many ways, set the bar for what a private space agency can achieve. Before the explosion on September 1, SpaceX was averaging one launch per month in 2016, successfully landing six of those eight first-stage boosters. Blue Origin may have landed a rocket for the first time, but SpaceX showed us that it can be done with large rockets and after launches into orbit.

The dramatic launchpad explosion on September 1 threw a wrench into that previous success. ""This will be a tough flight for us coming back after our event on September 1,"" said Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and COO, in an interview on CBS This Morning. Shotwell admitted that there is more pressure on this launch, but also said that ""every launch is a nerve-racking, emotional, significant emotional event. ... A million things have to go right in order to have a successful launch, literally, and only one thing has to go wrong to have a really particularly bad day.""

After the recent Falcon 9 explosion, United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, was quick to assert that it was the more reliable option for launching military satellites, contracts that the company competes with SpaceX for. It's impossible not to wonder who will come out on top, the team of giant defense contractors, or the billionaire tech magnate's startup. The real test, however, will be which company launches astronauts to the International Space Station first, something that NASA said both ULA and SpaceX are not ready to do by the end of this year as initially planned.

A report from the Wall Street Journal this morning revealed further woes for SpaceX, as the company suffered a $250 million annual loss and a 6 percent drop in revenue in 2015 following the loss of a Falcon 9 rocket after launch in June of that year. The September 2016 explosion-the only other time SpaceX lost a launch vehicle-took out the $62 million rocket and the roughly $200 million satellite it was carrying, and combined with the resulting months of launch delays, SpaceX might have taken a similar hit in 2016. The WSJ report also revealed that SpaceX is counting on its plan to launch over 4,000 satellites with the goal of supplying high-speed internet around the globe to become a greater source of revenue than its rocket division, and ultimately that satellite-internet business is needed to fund SpaceX's bold ambitions for manned missions to Mars.

Tomorrow's launch is an opportunity for SpaceX to not only return to flight and restore confidence in the Falcon 9, but also carry out a complicated mission similar to what will be needed for its satellite-internet network. SpaceX needs to deploy all 10 of the 1,874-pound Iridium-NEXT satellites into orbit using a specialized dispenser on the second stage of the rocket. These 10 satellites are the first of 72 satellites planned for launch-66 active in the network, and 6 on-hand spares.

The Iridium-Next network will be the second 66-satellite constellation operated by the Virginia-based company. Elon Musk called it ""the most ambitious, innovative thing in space communications that is going to happen anytime this decade"" in a video released by Iridium Communications. It's exactly this type of satellite network building that SpaceX hopes to achieve with its proposed internet-satellite venture.

Rockets explode. It happens to all spaceflight agencies around the globe as a natural part of the dangers of exploring the worlds beyond our own. But those dangers are worth pushing the boundaries of exploration and technology. It's time for the Falcon 9 to fly again."
2440650397,"- Elon Musk's SpaceX lost more than a quarter of a billion dollars in 2015 after a botched cargo run to the International Space Station and the subsequent grounding of its Falcon 9 rocket fleet, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

The accident derailed SpaceX's expectations of $1.8 billion in launch revenue in 2016, an analysis of the privately held firm's financial documents showed, according to the Journal, which said it had obtained the documents.

SpaceX declined to comment on the Journal's report.

In a statement emailed to Reuters, SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen said the company ""is in a financially strong position"" with more than $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt.

SpaceX, owned and operated by Musk, who also is chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), is aiming to return to flight on Saturday following a second Falcon 9 accident on Sept. 1."

2440726515,"Billionaire Elon Musk's vision for his Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to carry not just satellites but ultimately humans to Mars is at stake as the rocket maker prepares for its first flight since a fiery launchpad accident four months ago.

The blast, which Musk termed ""the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had,"" destroyed an Israeli satellite and a SpaceX rocket. Convinced that it pinpointed the mishap's cause, the company will try again Saturday at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. At stake: proving to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that it can safely carry astronauts ahead of a manned test flight planned for next year.

""This will be a tough flight for us coming back after our event on September 1,"" SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said in an interview on CBS Friday morning. ""A million things have to go right in order to have a successful launch.""

Musk, who is also the chief executive officer of Tesla Motors Inc., founded SpaceX 15 years ago with the express goal of sending humans to Mars. The company makes rockets at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California and has contracts to launch commercial satellites as well as fly missions for NASA and the U.S. military.

NASA Contracts

SpaceX has been awarded NASA contracts valued at $4.2 billion to resupply the International Space Station via its unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ultimately ferry astronauts to the station from the U.S.

Rocket launches can be delayed for several reasons, from inclement weather to last-minute technical glitches, and aren't uncommon. If all goes as planned Saturday, SpaceX will launch 10 Iridium Communications Inc. satellites. 

The satellites aboard the Falcon 9 rocket this time are part of the Iridium NEXT constellation network, providing new and better communications services such as allowing air-traffic controllers to monitor planes flying over oceans anywhere in the world. Iridium, based in McLean, Virginia, is counting on SpaceX to take 70 new satellites into orbit via seven separate launches over the next 14 to 18 months.
The new constellation would enable Iridium to offer new services and to continue servicing existing clients without interruption. Its existing satellites are 19 years old, which is old by industry standards.

Drone Ship

SpaceX plans to recover the rocket's first stage on an unmanned drone ship bobbing in the ocean, a feat it accomplished four times in 2016.

NASA, which ended its 30-year space shuttle program in 2011, is counting on partnerships with private industry to fly both cargo and crew. Last month, NASA announced that SpaceX is targeting November for its first demonstration mission and May 2018 for the first demonstration mission that will have two astronauts aboard.

The September blast renewed concerns about the way that Falcon 9 rockets are fueled, particularly since SpaceX has proposed to have astronauts board its Dragon ship before propellants are loaded. For crews, the Dragon is designed with a launch abort system to ensure safety; the Sept. 1 blast occurred during the final phase of fueling for a prelaunch test. No one was injured.

""NASA is continuing its evaluation of the SpaceX concept for fueling the Falcon 9 for commercial crew launches,"" the agency said in a November statement. ""The results of the company's Sept. 1 mishap investigation will be incorporated into NASA's evaluation.""

Accident Investigation

An accident investigation team led by SpaceX ""concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels inside the second stage liquid oxygen tank failed,"" the company said in a statement earlier this month. The September failure probably resulted from an oxygen buildup and the company is taking corrective actions, according to the statement.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that SpaceX's June 2015 mishap, which destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket with cargo destined for the International Space Station, as well as the one in September have contributed to a drop in revenue.

""We have more than 70 future launches on our manifest representing over $10 billion in contracts,"" SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen told the Journal. ""The company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.""

Shotwell said the company wants to launch 20 to 24 rockets this year, an aggressive launch cadence given that eight successful missions were completed in 2016.

""It's very crucial that it's a successful launch,"" said Marco Caceres, senior analyst at consultant Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia, in a phone interview. ""Every launch has to be flawless because SpaceX will eventually launch astronauts to the International Space Station. SpaceX expects to do a lot more, with a lot more responsibility."""
2440742098,"SpaceX is launching its first mission since a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launch pad during preflight routines in September of last year. The launch is set to take place Saturday, January 14 at 9:54:39 AM PT, or 12:54:39 PM ET. A Falcon 9 rocket will carry 10 Iridium NEXT satellites, designed to form the base of a mobile voice and data network that will eventually include 70 satellites in total.

The crucial launch will originate from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California; if all goes well, the satellites will begin to be deployed in low-earth orbit starting around one hour after take-off. Once the second stage separates to carry those satellites into orbit, the first stage will attempt to land on SpaceX's floating drone barge landing pad, which will be waiting in the Pacific Ocean to attempt recovery.

Iridium's NEXT project hopes to begin commercial service in 2017, offering voice and data network service across a few different verticals. The payload is currently sitting on the launch pad awaiting the go-ahead, having already undergone their final clearance and a dry run of the launch countdown process.

SpaceX says that it's currently looking at around 60 percent favorable in terms of weather conditions on the ground for the Saturday launch attempt, owing to ground wind speeds. A first launch window for January 9 was scrapped because of high winds, so we'll keep you updated as to whether or not this effort is also scrubbed - if it is, the next available window is January 15, beginning at 9:49 AM PT. The webcast above will begin 20 minutes prior to the first launch window at 9:54:39 AM PT."
2440772530,"Post-launch update: Despite some last minute concerns about strong winds and a wayward boat, SpaceX launched on Saturday morning from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Falcon 9 rocket made a picturesque ascent, delivering its payload of 10 large satellites into low-Earth orbit (they should reach their final 625km orbit about 90 minutes after launch). The first stage then descended back to Earth and, for the first time, an on board camera provided views all the way down.

The rocket then stuck its landing on Just Read the Instructions, marking the first time the company has landed a booster in the Pacific Ocean.

Original story: Today SpaceX will attempt to launch its Falcon 9 rocket for the first time since a fueling accident on Sept. 1, 2016, which destroyed the booster and its satellite payload on the launch pad. The instantaneous launch window for Saturday's attempt opens at 12:54pm ET (17:54pm UK), with liftoff occurring from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

After a rather quick investigation into the September accident, in which SpaceX concluded that one of three composite overwrapped pressure vessels inside the rocket's second stage liquid oxygen tank failed, the company has modified the fueling process. By taking a slower approach with its load and go fueling method, SpaceX expects to put less stress on the pressure vessels.

During SpaceX's last successful mission, the launch of JCSAT-16 in August, fueling of kerosene and liquid oxygen both began 35 minutes before launch. Now the company says kerosene loading will begin 70 minutes before launch, with liquid oxygen fueling beginning at 45 minutes prior.

Saturday's launch will boost 10 Iridium NEXT satellites to a 625-km orbit. These are the first 10 of 70 next generation satellites that SpaceX will launch for Iridium and its mobile voice and data satellite communications network. After boosting the satellites into space, the first stage of Falcon 9 will attempt a landing on the Just Read the Instructions droneship in the Pacific Ocean. The webcast should begin about 20 minutes before Saturday's launch window opens.

The launch attempt comes at a critical time for SpaceX, which has had two accidents with its Falcon 9 rocket in less than two years. A report released Friday suggested the company has gone from being moderately profitable to sustaining significant losses in the wake of those accidents. So now the company must begin flying its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket safely, and often. That effort starts Saturday."
2440843402,"WASHINGTON - A Chinese technology group is planning to raise $195 million to purchase Dubai-based mobile satellite communications company Thuraya.

China Trends Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-based company with a self-described focus on electronics and low carbon products and applications, informed the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market Jan. 10 that it is seeking to acquire Thuraya through the purchase of another company, Skynet Satellite Data Limited. However, it warned that factors such as its ability to acquire the Skynet shares, and U.S. regulatory policy, might fluster these plans.

On Nov. 25, China Trends Holdings agreed to purchase all of Skynet's shares for $3.9 million. Hong Kong-based Skynet, with partners Poly LM Asset Management Co., Ltd. and GC Capital Partners Limited, signed a memorandum of understanding with Thuraya in March 2016 to invest in the company and its ""next generation project,"" which presumably is the company's proposed Futura constellation. On Dec. 30, China Trends Holdings arranged convertible notes with a placing agent to raise $195 million for the acquisition of Thuraya.

China Trends Holdings, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is not the first Chinese company with an overseas presence that has sought to acquire a foreign satellite operator.

Chinese conglomerate Beijing Xinwei Technology Group created Luxembourg Space Telecommunication as a subsidiary to acquire Spacecom in Israel. As a condition of that acquisition, which remains stalled in negotiations after Spacecom lost a satellite in a September Falcon 9 explosion, Israel stipulated that satellite operations remain in Israel.

In its filing, China Trends Holdings said its main concerns regarding the proposed Thuraya acquisition are getting the legal paperwork from third parties and governments, and shareholder approval. China Trends Holdings specifically mentioned the U.S.'s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as a potential concern. Thuraya's two satellites, Thuraya-2 and Thuraya-3, are both products of California manufacturer Boeing.

China Trends Holdings did not give an alternate strategy if regulatory or other similar challenges circumvent the purchase of Thuraya. If the placing round is under-subscribed, the company said it would both ""explore other fund raising method to raise the required funds,"" and ""negotiate further with the relevant parties"" on the nature of the agreements.

Thuraya began fundraising for its next generation Futura constellation in the fourth quarter of 2016, and has yet to select a manufacturer for the satellites. The operator plans to launch two or three Futura satellites around 2020 with L- and Ka-band capacity and a global footprint. Thuraya's current satellites do not cover the Americas.

2440891880,"SpaceX is busy preparing for its first Falcon 9 launch since its rocket exploded in September. The Iridium-1 mission will take off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California tomorrow, January 14th, and you can watch it all happen live after the break or through the space corporation's website. This mission is headed to Low Earth orbit to deliver 10 satellites for communications company Iridium. They're the first 10 of at least 70 satellites SpaceX will be ferrying to LEO for Iridium's global constellation.

As always, though, the launch could still be delayed due to strong winds and other factors -- in fact, this Falcon 9 was supposed to take off a few days ago. We'll update this post in case that happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the video below for the private space company's return to flight. It will begin airing the corporation's live broadcast at 12:34PM Eastern, 20 minutes before the launch window opens at 12:54PM."
2440902130,"Four months after an Upgraded Falcon 9 booster catastrophically exploded on Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla.-destroying both the vehicle and its payload, the Amos-6 communications satellite-SpaceX is ready for its second Return-to-Flight (RTF) in just over a year. The Hawthorne, Calif.-headquartered launch services organization plans to launch 10 Iridium NEXT global mobile telecommunications satellites into low-Earth orbit, no sooner than 9:54 a.m. PST Saturday, 14 January. The mission will be SpaceX's third launch from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.

Originally targeted for launch on Sunday, 8 January, the customary Static Fire Test was performed successfully on Thursday. ""Hold-down firing of @SpaceX Falcon 9 at Vandenberg Air Force Base completed,"" tweeted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on Thursday afternoon. ""All systems are Go for launch next week."" However, with the Amos-6 investigation still awaiting official closure from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-which carries executive oversight and responsibility for issuing the customary launch licenses-it remained to be seen if the target date would be met. However, on Friday morning, the FAA announced that it was satisfied with the Amos-6 investigation report and issued the requisite licenses, allowing work to progress toward an opening launch attempt on Monday. ""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" it was noted. ""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose."" It was stressed that the conditions included a landing of the Upgraded Falcon 9 hardware either in the ocean or on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS).

""Looks like we're good to go for Monday!"" exulted Iridium CEO Matt Desch in a Friday afternoon tweet. ""We'll just have to see about the weather. Anti-rain dances, anyone?""

Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other ideas, with high winds and rain forecast for Vandenberg throughout most of this week. ""Launch moving due to high winds and rains at Vandenberg,"" SpaceX tweeted on Sunday morning. ""Other range conflicts this week results in next available launch date being Jan 14.""

In spite of the assurances from SpaceX and Iridium that Saturday was the formal target, it was not until Friday afternoon that the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg confirmed Western Range readiness to support the launch. It was noted that the final FAA conditions were removed at 12:39 p.m. PST, allowing for authorization to proceed. ""Vandenberg looks forward to the inaugural launch of Iridium NEXT and the return to flight of SpaceX,"" said Col. J. Christopher Moss, 30th Space Wing Commander, who will be the Launch Decision Authority for tomorrow's launch attempt. ""This is an exciting mission and we have worked closely with our mission partners at SpaceX to ensure a safe and successful launch."" SpaceX also highlighted a 60-percent likelihood of acceptable weather conditions for launch.

Saturday's flight is the first of seven launches for which SpaceX is contracted to transport 70 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit. When the details for this mammoth contract were agreed between SpaceX and Iridium, back in June 2010, it marked the largest single launch deal ever signed, worth some $492 million. Over the coming months and years, Iridium NEXT will completely replace an aging network of first-generation Iridium satellites, whose earliest members were launched two decades ago.

In fact, from May 1997 until June 2002, a total of 95 first-generation Iridium satellites were inserted into low-Earth orbit, via four different vehicles and from four different locations: aboard Delta II rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., aboard Proton-K and Rokot-KM boosters from Russia's Baikonur and Plesetsk cosmodromes and aboard the workhorse Cheng Zheng (CZ)-2C from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in China's northern Shanxi Province. Developed and owned by Motorola, the first-generation Iridiums were built by Lockheed Martin on the basis of its LM-700 ""bus,"" with each satellite weighing around 1,520 pounds (690 kg) and deriving electrical power from a pair of deployable solar arrays and associated batteries.

Iridium was intended as a global mobile telecommunications network, employing dozens of small satellites in low-Earth orbit. By routing signals via Ka-band from satellite to satellite, using on-board processing, it was expected that the problems of weak reception at higher latitudes from geostationary satellites could be overcome. ""Anyone with an Iridium phone would be within sight of a satellite,"" noted New Scientist in a recent article, ""and those satellites would communicate with each other, enabling everyone on Earth to talk to everyone else."" Original plans called for a total of 77 Iridiums to be launched-hence the name, which honored the metal with atomic number 77-but it was eventually concluded that just 66 were required. Additionally, Iridium carries a number of on-orbit spares.

The satellites occupy high-inclination, near-polar orbits of 86.4 degrees and operate at an altitude of approximately 485 miles (780 km). The first Iridium telephone call was made by then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore in November 1998, who used a handset in the White House Rose Garden to call National Geographic Society Chairman Gilbert Grosvenor, great-grandson of Alexander Graham Bell.

However, by the time it entered operational service, the Iridium concept was already obsolete and its market success was not strong; by the turn of the millennium it had gone bankrupt. Yet it endured as a means of covering regions of Earth where reliable geosynchronous communications was sparse or non-existent and its users included explorers and the military. As of today, some 64 of the 66 Iridium satellites needed for ""seamless"" global coverage are operational.

Planning for the next generation, dubbed ""Iridium NEXT,"" was announced in early June 2010, and Thales Alenia Space and its subcontractor Orbital Sciences Corp. (later Orbital ATK) was selected to build 66 operational satellites and six on-orbit and nine ground-based spares, at an anticipated cost of $2.9 billion. Iridium NEXT would be based upon the Extended LifeTime Bus (ELiTeBus)-1000 design, previously employed for the low-Earth-orbiting GlobalStar communications satellites, launched between 2006 and 2012. Weighing 1,760 pounds (800 kg), the Iridium NEXT satellites would be powered by twin solar arrays and would operate at an altitude of 485 miles (780 km), inclined 86.4 degrees to the equator and capable of supporting a decade-long lifespan. The solar arrays-spanning 31 feet (9.4 meters) when fully unfurled and capable of generating 2 kilowatts-would offer a 50-percent uplift over the power-producing potential of the original Iridium satellites.

Also in June 2010, SpaceX was selected to deliver the Iridium NEXT constellation in its entirety to orbit, with seven launches out of Vandenberg Air Force Base between 2015 and 2017. ""The $492 million contract,"" explained Iridium in a news release, ""while being the largest single commercial launch deal ever signed, nonetheless represents a new benchmark in cost-effective satellite delivery to space.""

Moscow-based International Space Company (ISC) Kosmotras was also contracted in June 2011 as a ""supplemental provider of launch services,"" with the expectation that its silo-launched Dnepr booster would deliver the first two Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit in April 2016, with SpaceX's launches expected to begin later that summer. However, according to Space News, Iridium became frustrated by Russian red tape-specifically delays in the issuance of licenses by the Russian Ministry of Defense-and the Dnepr launch will now likely occur further downstream.

By the spring of 2012, Iridium NEXT had passed smoothly through its Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and had completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) by October 2013. As the constellation of satellites entered full-up construction, the Iridium NEXT capabilities were extensively tested, culminating in an end-to-end ""test call"" of the communications hardware in July 2014. Last summer, the first batch of satellites were completed and readied for shipment to Vandenberg, with an expected launch in mid-September 2016. ""This is a really exciting milestone,"" said Matt Desch. ""After more than seven years of effort, the first of our next-generation satellites are finally ready for space.""

The expectation was that the entire Iridium NEXT constellation would be delivered to orbit before the end of 2017. Unfortunately, last September's explosion of an Upgraded Falcon 9 booster on Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla.-which destroyed both the vehicle and its payload, the Amos-6 communications satellite-grounded the SpaceX fleet, as investigators sought the cause of the accident. Early in December, Iridium announced a revised target date of No Earlier Than (NET) 16 December, with an Upgraded Falcon 9 boosting 10 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-4E at Vandenberg. On 8 November, Mr. Desch tweeted his 1,850 followers that the second stage of the Upgraded Falcon 9 for Iridium NEXT's first mission had arrived safely at Vandenberg. Less than two weeks later, on the 20th, he added that the first stage hardware had also arrived.

However, as noted by AmericaSpace's Mike Killian in a recent article, the launch slipped into January 2017 as SpaceX sought ""to complete the final steps necessary to safely and reliably return to flight."" The news of the delay was disappointing, though unsurprising, in view of the still-unclosed nature of the Amos-6 investigation. ""Santa delaying my Xmas present, but agree with @SpaceX on the new plan,"" tweeted Mr. Desch on 16 December. ""Few weeks delay-exciting start to 2017!"" He subsequently shared images of the Upgraded Falcon 9 undergoing final processing and, by Christmas week, the 10 fully fueled Iridium NEXT satellites were stacked in their dispenser for emplacement aboard the booster. In keeping with new procedures, implemented since the Amos-6 explosion, SpaceX will now install payloads aboard the booster after the Static Fire Test. With the completion of the test on Thursday, the Iridium NEXT payload was loaded over the weekend.

Last week, AmericaSpace reported that SpaceX was aiming for a launch attempt at 10:28:07 a.m. PST on Sunday, 8 January, although the poor weather and range-related issues on the West Coast have necessitated a move to no sooner than 9:54 a.m. PST Saturday. It marks the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company's 29th overall mission of its Falcon 9 hardware. First flown in June 2010, the fleet has progressed through a number of significant upgrades. These have included its ""v1.1"" variant-which sported uprated Merlin 1D engines and enabled an offshore soft-landing capability on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS)-and its current configuration, which benefits from the ""densification"" of its cryogenic propellants and accomplished a successful first-stage touchdown on solid ground in December 2015.

In its 28 flights completed to date, the Falcon 9 has delivered 15 major payloads to low-Earth orbit-including nine Dragon cargo ships, bound for the International Space Station (ISS)-together with 11 communications satellites to geosynchronous orbit and a handful of scientific spacecraft to other locations, including near-polar orbit and further afield to the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian Point. The Falcon 9 suffered a major failure during flight on 28 June 2015, destroying its Dragon payload, and endured another serious accident on 1 September 2016, when it catastrophically exploded on the launch pad."
2440927452,"SpaceX rolled a fully-assembled Falcon 9 booster out of its hangar and lifted it on top of a launch pad Friday for the first time since an explosion grounded the commercial rocket last year, setting the stage for a one-second launch window Saturday to take off from California's Central Coast and deploy the first 10 satellites in orbit for a $3 billion upgrade to Iridium's globe-spanning message relay network.

Liftoff is set for 9:54:39 a.m. PST (12:54:39 p.m. EST; 1754:39 GMT) Saturday from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base, a military launch facility located on the Pacific coastline northwest of Los Angeles.

Weather forecasters at Vandenberg predict a 40 percent chance gusty winds could prevent launch Saturday. If the Falcon 9 rocket does not get off the ground Saturday, there is a backup opportunity available Sunday.

The mission is vital to the futures of SpaceX and Iridium, which signed a $500 million deal in 2010 for at least seven launches to place 70 next-generation communications craft in orbit.

At the time, the agreement was the largest commercial launch contract in history, giving SpaceX its most significant customer outside NASA, and providing Iridium hundreds of millions of dollars in savings by taking a chance on the then-brand new Falcon 9 rocket, which in June 2010 had just one test flight in its logbook.

At the time Iridium and SpaceX, a company founded in 2002 by tech mogul Elon Musk, intended to launch the first batch of satellites in 2015.

""So many emotions,"" said Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, in an interview with Spaceflight Now on Friday. ""I'm excited, nervous, and anxious. Frankly, I thought I would be doing this almost 18 months ago, but we were getting through production issues and then launch issues.""

Overcoming manufacturing bottlenecks and a geopolitical hurdle that thwarted its plans to launch two demo satellites on a Russian-Ukrainian rocket, Iridium shipped its first 10 completed satellites to their launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, last summer from a production facility near Phoenix.

Iridium and SpaceX aimed to launch the 10 spacecraft in mid-September, but those plans were stalled when a Falcon 9 rocket preparing to launch from Florida exploded on the ground during a pre-flight test, destroying the booster and the nearly $200 million Amos 6 communications satellite on-board.

The accident was the second time SpaceX has lost a Falcon 9 rocket and its payload, coming 14 months after a launcher disintegrated in flight minutes after departing Cape Canaveral with a Dragon supply ship heading for the International Space Station.

SpaceX engineers probing the Sept. 1 accident determined the explosion was triggered by the sudden failure of a tank of high-pressure helium immersed inside minus 340 degree Fahrenheit (minus 206 degree Celsius) liquid oxygen on the Falcon 9's second stage.

Engineers identified several ""credible causes"" for the failure, SpaceX said, all of which involve super-chilled liquid oxygen - or even frozen oxygen - getting trapped in buckles between the helium tank's aluminum liner and a carbon overwrap. SpaceX said helium tanks - called composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVs - recovered at the launch pad showed buckles in their liners.

According to SpaceX's tests after the Sept. 1 explosion, oxygen trapped in the buckles can break fibers in the carbon overwrap or generating friction that can ignite the material, causing the helium vessel to fail spectacularly.

SpaceX uses colder-than-usual, or densified, liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene propellants on its rockets, a change introduced to the Falcon 9 program in 2015 to permit more fuel to be loaded into the propellant tanks and giving the vehicle's Merlin engines more power.

Company officials said the helium will be loaded at warmer temperatures on future countdowns, ""as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration.""

A press kit for Saturday's launch also suggests other changes to the Falcon 9 countdown.

At the same time it debuted the more capable Falcon 9 configuration in 2015, SpaceX shortened its launch countdowns to begin pumping propellants into the rocket just 35 minutes before blastoff. SpaceX's previous Falcon 9 countdowns followed a practice employed universally on cryogenically-fueled rockets worldwide, in which propellants are loaded aboard several hours ahead of launch.

The ""load and go"" countdowns caused headaches at first, leading to several aborts and delays before SpaceX gained experience with the practice early last year.

The timeline for Saturday's countdown calls for RP-1 kerosene, chilled to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 degrees Celsius), to begin flowing into the two-stage rocket at T-minus 70 minutes. Liquid oxygen loading will follow at T-minus 45 minutes.

SpaceX ran the Falcon 9 rocket through a ""static fire"" engine test at Vandenberg on Jan. 5, completing a major milestone in the run-up to Saturday's mission, the same type of test that resulted in the explosion in Florida on Sept. 1.

But Iridium's satellites were not fastened on top of the rocket for the static fire test, an operation that exercises the Falcon 9 vehicle and the launch team which SpaceX conducts before every launch. Several satellite owners put their payloads on-board the Falcon 9 for the hotfire tests leading up to the mishap on the pad last year, but several SpaceX customers have said they will avoid doing that again.

The rocket returned to its hangar last week to receive the 10 Iridium satellites, already enclosed within the Falcon 9's payload fairing, then returned to the pad early Friday.

Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president and chief operating officer, told CBS This Morning that she shares Desch's anxiety and excitement.

""This will be a tough flight for us coming back after our event on September 1st,"" Shotwell said. ""It is actually a difficult flight, regardless of the return-to-flight element.""

""The most recent anomaly just added to the drama, so I'm all excited, but I also have to remind myself this is not a sprint,"" Desch said. ""This is a marathon. I have at least seven of these to do, so I have to pace myself because it's more about completing the network than necessarily one specific launch. But we can't have successful launches until we have our first.""

The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will take off from its hillside launch complex, the former West Coast home of the Titan 4 launcher, and head south over the Pacific Ocean, passing to the west of the Channel Islands. With its nine rear-mounted Merlin 1D engines throttled up to 1.7 million pounds of thrust, the Falcon 9 will surpass the speed of sound just over one minute into the mission.

The nine-engine first stage booster will shut off at T+plus 2 minutes, 24 seconds. Three seconds later, pneumatic pushers will separate the Falcon 9's first and second stages, followed by ignition of the upper stage's single Merlin engine at T+plus 2 minutes, 35 seconds.

The Falcon 9's first stage, standing 15 stories tall with a diameter of 12 feet (3.7 meters), will flip around using cold-gas nitrogen thrusters to fly tail first, kicking off maneuvers to return to Earth for a propulsive vertical landing on a barge positioned several hundred miles south of Vandenberg in the Pacific Ocean.

While the upper stage's Merlin engine sends the Iridium satellites into a preliminary egg-shaped parking orbit, the first stage will fire a subset of its engines multiple times to guide the rocket toward its target, an ocean-going landing pad the size of a football field, and slow down for the final descent.

Four aerodynamic grid fins will pop open from the upper segment of the booster for steering, while four carbon-fiber landing legs will deploy at the base of the rocket just before touchdown. Vectored thrust from one of the first stage's Merlin engines will do the final bit of positioning to place the rocket on the barge, or ""drone ship.""

The landing, if successful, will give SpaceX a stable of seven previously-flown first stage boosters in its inventory.

SpaceX aims to start reusing Falcon 9 first stages as soon as next month with the launch of the SES 10 commercial telecom satellite. The satellites's owner, SES of Luxembourg, agreed in August to put the spacecraft on the first launch of a used Falcon 9 rocket stage.

SpaceX officials say reusability will reduce the cost of space launches, opening the frontier to more commercial investment, research opportunities and eventually a human base on Mars, Musk's long-term objective.

The first Falcon 9 first stage recovered intact landed after a launch in December 2015. It is now erected on display outside SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The others have gone through extensive tests, including repeated firings on the ground, or are being readied for future flights.

Touchdown of the first stage is expected around T+plus 7 minutes, 49 seconds, just before the Falcon 9 upper stage reaches an initial orbit around Earth and turns off its Merlin engine at T+plus 9 minutes, 9 seconds.

Flying through space at a slip of 5 miles (8 kilometers) every second, the battery-powered upper stage will soar over Antarctica, then reignite its engine at T+plus 52 minutes, 31 seconds. The brief second burn will last just three seconds, long enough to circularize the rocket's orbit at an altitude of 388 miles (625 kilometers).

The French-designed, U.S.-built Iridium communications craft are attached to a dispenser aboard the Falcon 9 upper stage. The satellites, each weighing 1,896 pounds (860 kilograms), will deploy from the rocket one at a time at intervals of around 90 seconds starting at T+plus 59 minutes, 16 seconds.

The separation maneuvers should be completed 15 minutes later, and Desch said the satellites should start radioing Iridium's ground control team in Ashburn, Virginia, within a few minutes of their release in polar orbit.

""I know everyone's focus is on the rocket,"" Desch said. ""There have been 27 successful launches of that rocket, and I'm highly confident this is going to be that next one. The real nerves for me is that this is the first time we have deployed our satellites and had them talk to us. I know that fear will go down dramatically once we get some satellites in orbit.""

The satellites were designed by Thales Alenia Space in France, and then assembled and tested in an assembly line fashion in partnership with Orbital ATK in Arizona.

""About 100 minutes into the flight, the first of our 10 satellites should be checking in with our network operations center in Ashburn, Virginia, and when the boards go green and things are looking pretty good, that's when I'll probably breathe a big sigh of relief,"" Desch said.

The so-called ""Iridium Next"" network will offer faster broadband connections, improved functionality and 3G-equivalent cellular phone services for Iridium's pool of nearly 850,000 subscribers, a client list that includes the U.S. military, oil and gas companies, aviation and maritime operators, and mining and construction contractors.

Iridium and its contractors will spend around three months wringing out the first set of 10 Iridium Next spacecraft ahead of the launch of the next batch in April, according to Desch.

As more new satellites are added to the Iridium fleet, engineers will maneuver them from their 388-mile-high drop-off orbit into the operational constellation at an altitude of 485 miles (780 kilometers).

The Iridium network relies on satellites spread out in six orbital lanes, each home to 11 active spacecraft, to provide uninterrupted global coverage.

The company's existing satellites were launched from 1997 through 2002 for missions originally scheduled to least eight years. Nevertheless, Desch said most of the satellites have outlived their design lives, and 64 of the 66 relay stations required for worldwide service remain operational.

Two satellites dropped offline last year, reducing Iridium's service availability to around 98 percent.

""We need reinforcements to replace the network,"" Desch said Friday. ""We haven't lost any other satellites, knock on wood, in at least six months or longer now. The current network is holding up fine. I would expect it will still be able to maintain that high performacne for another two or three years, at least, because the satellites are not showing signs of imminent decline.""

The Iridium Next program is a $3 billion investment by Iridium. The purchase of 81 satellites represents approximately $2.2 billion of that cost, Desch said, and the company's launch contract with SpaceX for seven Falcon 9 flights was valued at $492 million when the parties signed it in 2010.

Desch said Iridium will scale back its capital expenditures once the new-generation fleet is up and running.

""That underpins all of this,"" Desch said. ""It's not just a technical marvel that we're doing, but it's also a financial transformation that we're not very far away from, finally, but we've got to get these satellites up first."""

 HIGHLIGHT: 
 Trump Future Cabinet Contradict Boss on Policy; Nintendo Announces Release Date, Price of Switch; President Obama Changes Cuban Immigration Policy.

[08:00:20] KRISTIE LU STOUT, HOST: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, and welcome to News Stream.

A great divide: now members of Donald Trump's future cabinet contradict their boss on key policy. We'll break down what's been said.

Also, a big change is coming for a long-standing U.S. policy towards migrants from Cuba. What President Barack Obama has ordered in his final days in office.

And Nintendo fans rejoice: there's finally a release date and a price on its brand new console.

At this time next week, Donald Trump will be preparing to take the oath of office, to be sworn in as the next president of the United States, and he's playing down any contradictions in policy that have come up.

At this time next week, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the next president of the United States. And he's playing down any contradictions in policy that have come up.

Now, many of his proposed cabinet members are appearing before Senate confirmation hearings and they aren't always agreeing with their boss-to be. Now, we're also following two other major developments, both involve the head of the FBI and one is linked to Hillary Clinton's e-mail saga.

We've got more on that shortly. But first, the U.S. president-elect has responded to critics who say some of his cabinet nominees have contradicted him during their confirmation hearings. And Donald Trump tweeted this moments ago, quote, ""all of my cabinet nominees are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine.""

CNN's Sunlen Serfaty has more on that.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the first week of confirmation hearings for key members of Donald Trump's cabinet, his nominees breaking from some of his biggest campaign promises and policies. Like the president- elect's soft stance on Russia.

TRUMP: If Putin likes Donald Trump, I'd consider that an asset.

SERFATY: Trump's nominees for defense secretary and secretary of state taking a more adversarial stance.

JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: I would consider the principle threats to start with Russia. We're not likely to ever be friends.

SERFATY: If confirmed, Rex Tillerson would be America's top diplomat. But he says he hasn't even spoken to Trump about Russia.

SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D), NEW JERSEY: I would have thought Russia would be at the very top of that considering all the actions that have taken place. Did that not happen?

REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINEE: That has not occurred yet senator.

MENENDEZ: That's pretty amazing.

SERFATY: After months of doubting the conclusions of U.S. intelligence, Trump now believes Russia was the culprit.

TRUMP: I think it was Russia.

SERFATY: CIA director Mike Pompeo says Russia cyber hacking is going to need a robust response.

MIKE POMPEO, CIA DIRECTOR NOMINEE: This was an aggressive action taken by the senior leadership inside Russia. And America has an obligation. And the CIA has a part of that obligation to protect that information.

SERFATY: Fellow appointees also breaking from Trump's call to bring back illegal interrogations tactics.

TRUMP: Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I'd approve it.

SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R-AL), ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE: Absolutely improper and illegal.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely not.

GEN. JOHN F. KELLY, NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF DHS: I don't think we should ever come close to crossing a line that is beyond what Americans would expect to follow in terms of interrogation techniques.

SERFATY: He's promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border?

TRUMP: We're going to build a wall.

KELLY: A physical barrier, in and of itself, will not do the job. It has to be, really, a layered defense.

SERFATY: Trump's vow during the campaign to temporarily ban all Muslims entering the U.S.

SESSIONS: I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States.

KELLY: I don't think it's ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor.

TILLERSON: I do not support targeting any particular group.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

LU STOUT: Now, that was Sunlen Serfaty reporting there.

Now, one area of agreement between Trump and his nominee U.S. Secretary of State is the South China Sea. And it's angering Beijing.

Rex Tillerson says China should be denied access to the islands its built. And now The Global Times, a provocative Chinese tabloid, has slammed the former oil executive. It writes this, quote, ""unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.""

The op-ed concludes if Trump's diplomatic team shakes future Sino-U.S. ties as it is doing so now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.

Now, the Justice Department is looking at how the FBI handled the case of Hillary Clinton's private email server.

FBI Chief James Comey announced two weeks before the election that the bureau was reviewing a new batch of email. Some Democrats thought the timing was suspicious and it contributed to Clinton's ultimate loss.

Now, a former Clinton campaign manager is still very angry about it.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

[08:05:15] ROBBY MOOK, FRM. CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: The leaks that were coming left and right from the FBI were so slanted against Hillary Clinton. Director Comey also claimed that he needed to send that letter to The Hill because he was worried it would leak out. Well, we can't punish candidates because of the bad behavior, the improper and unprofessional behavior, of bureaucrats. It's just unacceptable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: Now, Comey, for his part, says he welcomes the investigation and wants the conclusions to be made public.

And some lawmakers seem to agree.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JASON CHAFFETZ, (R) CALIFORNIA: I think justice is what we all want to prevail. There are questions on both sides of the aisle about the timing and who they met with and information that was put out, and so it's not just about Director Comey, this review.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: And CNN has learned that James Comey was the one who briefed Donald Trump on those unsubstantiated claims that russia may have compromising information on him. And U.S. Vice President Joe Biden now says that he and President Obama were briefed about those claims as well. Allegations came from a former British intelligence officer and a report funded by Trump's political opponents.

Now, meanwhile, Russia is calling for more respect from the United States. Let's bring in Jill Dougherty from Moscow for more.

And Jill, we've got to talk about the Trump dossier and kompromat and the allegations of his deep ties with Russia, what does the Kremlin make of this, again, unverified report?

Well, they are certainly calling it fake and basically, you know, today when we spoke with Dmitry Peskov, who is the spokesperson for Putin. He essentially said I'm not going to talk about this anymore. He said there are a lot of fake reports being published out there. This is not the first one. It's of low quality. We don't need to pay so much attention to it, and then he added as we are doing amid this emotional storm which is dominating America right now.

So they are taking a hands off on this, basically saying, you know, of course, it's fake, but they don't want to wade into any of the details and I think you can imagine why. It's very complicated.

LU STOUT: And your thoughts on the future of relations between Russia and the U.S. under President Trump?

Trump, in a big turnaround earlier this week, he accepts Russia as behind the U.S. election hack. Tillerson during the hearing, that's of course his pick to be chief diplomat, has been very critical about Russia and its taking of Crimea, so is it necessarily going to be a thaw, a warmer relationship between these two countries?

DOUGHERTY: You know, this is the thing that I think the Russians really don't know. I mean, who does know because you're right there are a lot of contradictions, internal contradictions between the people that the president wants at his advisers on foreign policy, members of his cabinet, and what the president himself thinks.

Now, you just heard the tweet by Donald Trump, he's putting a good face on it, and maybe that is what he believes, that they have various opinions and he'll listen to them. But there's a distinct possibility that he won't listen to them. And this is creating a fair amount of confusion here in Moscow. So I was looking at one tweet by Alexei Pushkov, he's a member of parliament and does a lot of tweeting, and he said essentially the hearings in congress showed that relations with Trump's administration will not be easy. But then he added the window of opportunity exists, and it's important to take advantage of it.

So it's kind of like the same approach to the stories about, you know, kompromat, compromising material, basically a little bit of hands off by the Russians. At this point, they don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of it. And they continue to hold out the possibility that with respect on both sides, they can continue -- they will have a better relationship with Donald Trump than they had with Mr. Obama.

LU STOUT: Yeah, and because of that sentiment, as President Obama is moving out of the White House, are there celebrations in Moscow?

DOUGHERTY: You know, I think you could probably say that is true. And they're certainly happy. I would say happy to see him go.

There's a lot of personal criticism even about President Obama, considering him weak, ineffective, terrible president for the United States, and, of course, with the hope that Donald Trump who has said good things about Russia and Mr. Putin, that it will get better.

But it's really striking, Kristie, I would have to say that criticism of President Obama really goes beyond what I've ever seen in criticizing U.S. presidents.

[08:10:10] LU STOUT: Jill Dougherty reporting. Many thanks indeed for your inside analysis. As always, take care, Jill.

And while Russia maintains its innocence about hacking, that issue of cyber warfare is now unavoidable. And it's being undertaken by the U.S. military that is working to develop a new kind of soldier, one whose new front line soldier will be online.

MAJOR NATALIE VANATTA, U.S. ARMY CYBER INSTITUTE:: If we talk about cryptography, it's been around for about 4,000 years.

CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's not even 9:00 a.m. and these cadets are already being drilled in applied algebra with cryptology, the study of codes. It's just one of the disciplines in the West Point military academy's cyber curriculum.

VANATTA: That's what we call a brute force attack.

When we look at doing crypanalysis on ciphers is we just try every possible key on the keyspace.

SEBASTIAN: Some of these men and women will join the army's less than 3- year-old cyber branch when they graduate..

VANATTA: When ""a"" is not invertible (ph), that's what I want.

SEBASTIAN: Major Natalie Vanatta is a cyber officer herself, currently on teaching assignment.

VANATTA: We explore the mathematical ideas and foundations that make encryption systems work today.

If I use a bunch of them and interweave them.

And that's really important, because it really helps these cadets develop their criticaland creative thinking skills when it comes to, well, what do we do next?

SEBASTIAN: Steeped in tradition dating back centuries, West Point is now at the forefront of developing the army's newest and most technologically advanced career field: combating the growing threat in cyberspace.

COL. ANDREW HALL, DIR. U.S. ARMY CYBER INSTITUTE: We need soldiers that are able to incorporate the fighting in the domain of cyber into everything that we do in the army, that's well beyond just the setting up of the networks or the intelligence that's being collected over networks to actually learn how to maneuver in cyberspace and to be a war-fighting element.

SEBASTIAN: Colonel Andrew Hall leads the army's cyber institute at West Point, which not only runs the education program here, but also operates as an army think tank on cyber warfare issues.

I suppose the danger is that you are teaching something that is maybe evolving faster than you can teach it.

HALL: We're trying to teach them and educate them so they can solve problems. We're not sure yet what they are going to have to solve.

SEBASTIAN: For cadets like 22-year-old Diana Contreras, one of 15 cyber officers to be commissioned at West Point this year, it's a big responsibility.

DIANA CONTREAS, CADET: It's something that is so vital for our country as a whole. We can't function, we can't really survive as a nation without having backup cyber support, offense, defense.

SEBASTIAN: What does it mean, the insignia?

CONTREAS: So, the two lightning bolts represent the lightning gods who would send communications from above, and the sword represents readiness and combat. So, communications and readiness and combat.

SEBASTIAN: Old principles for a new and unpredictable kind of warfare.

Clare Sebastian, CNN, West Point, New York.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

LU STOUT: You're watching News Stream. And still to come, a decades-ole policy affecting Cubans trying to get to the U.S. has ended. We'll tell you what the changes mean for Cuban migrants.

And not a dry eye in the White House. Barack Obama's surprise honor for Joe Biden recognizing not just the vice president, but a loyal friend.

[08:15:40] LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. You're watching News Stream.

Now, U.S. Republicans with pressing forward with plans to dismantle Obamacare. A vote in the House today will be the next step after Senate Republicans had their way on Thursday.

Now, the House Speaker Paul Ryan told the CNN Town Hall that the law needs to be repealed and replaced quickly.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) WISCONSIN: Because we see this law collapsing even faster this year, because we see more insurance companies pulling out, people with little or no choices and another round of double-digit premium increases, we really feel we need to step in and provide better choices and better options as fast as possible so we're going to move on this as quickly as we can.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: First 100 days?

RYAN: Yeah, oh, yeah -- definitely is a plan within the first 100 days to get moving on this legislation.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: The Affordable Care Act provides health coverage to some 20 million Americans, and they include Jeff Jeans, who describes himself as a lifelong Republican and small business owner. At a CNN town hall he told Speaker Ryan that Obamacare literally saved his life.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JEFF JEANS, CANCER PATIENT: We offered three times the cost of my treatment which was rejected. They required an insurance card. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act I'm standing here today alive. Being both a small business person and someone with preexisting conditions.

RYAN: Right.

JEANS: I rely on the Affordable Care Act to be able to purchase my own insurance. Why would you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement?

RYAN: Oh, we -- we wouldn't do that. We want to replace it with something better.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: Now, a quick reminder of what the Affordable Care Act is all about, and why it's so controversial. It has been one of these most contentious and partisan issues in Washington since it became law in 2010. It has seen millions of Americans obtain health coverage and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. It requires everyone to have coverage or pay a fine.

Young adults can stay on a parents' plan until age 26, but critics say that Obamacare has done nothing to stop the rising cost of health care in the U.S.

Now, Republicans in congress are slowly getting rid of the Obama administration's flagship policy, but on Thursday Mr. Obama was the one ending a decades old policy, this one on Cuba.

The Cuban Adjustment Act, it's otherwise known as the wet foot, dry foot policy, is over. Now, the act allowed Cubans who managed to get on home soil and the U.S. to become permanent residents.

Now, the White House says the change won't affect migrants who are already all in the U.S.

Now Patrick Oppmann is in Havana with more on the story. And Patrick, what has been the general reaction across Cuba to this big policy turnaround?

PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Cuban government who has long criticized this law saying that it encouraged Cubans to make the illegal entry into the United States celebrated the repeal of it yesterday, President Obama ending the wet foot, dry foot policy, but for many Cubans who dreamed of going to the United States and for some who came so close to making it, it's nothing short of heartbreaking.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The 24 Cubans who arrived by a makeshift boat to a lighthouse nearly seven miles from the coast of Florida in 2016 thought they had made it.

Cubans who reach the U.S. got to stay under a law known as wet foot, dry foot. After the U.S. and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in 2015 a surge of Cubans, fearing a change in the law, left island.

""We thought we were on land. They say if it belongs to the United States it must be part of the United States,"" says Leland Concepcion (ph), one of the Cubans to reach the lighthouse.

But instead of bringing them to the U.S., the coast guard took the Cubans to a cutter where they waited and waited for 42 days. The issue was whether the lighthouse was really a dry land.

Aboard the cutter, the four Cubans we talked to said they slept on the ship's deck, the U.S. just out of reach on the horizon.

""For asking for water they (inaudible) my arms and a foot behind me for a whole day, he says. ""That isn't humane. I don't think those people were humane.""

Growing increasingly desperate, the Cubans asked the coast guard for scores from recent football matches, but what they really wanted was paper to write about their alleged mistreatment, then they put the paper in a water bottle with an inflated plastic glove tied to the top so the message in the bottle would float.

The message, they said, was their last chance to let the world know about their plight.

""We waited for the boat to get close to the coast and we threw it,"" he says. ""It was our last resort.""

We are in hell, the letter reads. Please, whoever finds this letter, make this paper arrive to a lawyer of the case, or someone who can help us, please.

A fisherman in Florida found the lighthouse Cuban's message in the bottle and did just that.

The coast guard said in a statement, the migrants were well-treated, but promised to investigate their allegations of abuse.

A U.S. federal court judge hearing their case ruled the lighthouse Cubans did not reach dry land, since even at low tide, the lighthouse stands in the water.

But 20 of the migrants were sent to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, while their case continues to be investigated.

The remaining four Cubans told us they were overwhelmed by the ordeal and chose to return here to Porte Padre, their hometown in Cuba, but one of the men, Walter Bareiro (ph) says he doesn't plan on staying long in Cuba.

""If the opportunity comes up, I would probably do it again, he says. Every other way of leaving here is too difficult.""

Contacted by CNN, members of the lighthouse Cubans said they would still try to reach the U.S. no matter the law, they said. They do not see a future in Cuba.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

OPPMANN: And Kristie, the White House says this change in law takes immediate effect. They didn't want to see a last-minute surge in immigration. Already, we're hearing reports of Cubans on the U.S.-Mexican border that are being turned away.

LU STOUT: Yeah, as you reported, I mean, this policy turnaround a nightmare for those four individuals whose fate have also been overturned. And Patrick, before you go, this decision is likely to be President Obama's last move after years of historic dealings with Cuba.

How will the U.S. president be remembered there?

OPPMANN: There's not been any president that has been so engaged. Of course, the first president since the Cuban revolution to visit Cuban and interact with Cubans. So, I think most Cubans here will remember him very positively.

But there's a lot of worry now, Kristie, with this change in law. People are afraid that the most desperate Cubans, Cubans who are eager to leave this country because of its failing economy, will now stay here and that could lead to social unrest and people perhaps acting out against the government. So a lot of concern today as Cubans, after many, many years lose their privilege status.

LU STOUT: Yeah. A big change in U.S. policy for Cuban migrants. Patrick Oppmann joining us live from Havana. Thank you.

Now, everything -- not everything that President Obama is doing in his final few days in office is as politically significant as that decision. He's also just done something of huge personal importance: surprising his friend, Vice President Joe Biden, with America's highest civilian honor. Here's Michelle Kosinski.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With humor and a crowd gathered in the State dining room.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This also gives the Internet one last chance to...

(LAUGHTER)

OBAMA: Talk about our bromance.

KOSINSKI: This thank you and good-bye was a surprise in itself.

OBAMA: It is as Joe once said a big deal. To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully.

KOSINSKI: And then the real surprise. The vice president taken completely off guard as a member of the military was called forward.

OBAMA: For the final time as president, I am pleased to award our nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

KOSINSKI: And taking it a step further, awarding it with distinction. Only ever bestowed upon Pope John Paul II, Ronald Reagan and Colin Powell. Now to Joe Biden for nearly a half century of public service, for fighting for the middle class, a fair judiciary and against crime, violence against women and cancer.

(On camera): White House sources say President Obama planned this himself. He came up with the idea. He wanted it to be a surprise. And so he worked with a very small group of staffers to make it happen.

(Voice-over): And Biden, true to character, made his acceptance all about those he says he has leaned on. Those he loves most. His family and the president.

JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just hope that the asterisk in history that is attached to my name when they talk about this presidency is that I can say I was part of -- part of the journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country.

KOSINSKI: Out of this candid emotion and all the memories one last Biden joke.

BIDEN: President looked at me and said, you know, Joe, you know what surprised me? How we have become such good friends.

(LAUGHTER)

[08:25:06] BIDEN: And I said surprised you? Mr. President, you know as long as there's breath in me I'll be there for you and my whole family will be, and I know, I know it is reciprocal. I -- and I wanted to thank you all so very, very, very much. All of you.

KOSINSKI: Michelle Kosinski, CNN, the White House.

LU STOUT: Now the United States is send is its most expensive weapon ever, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to Japan. Now, 16 of these are headed for Marine Corps station on the island of Honshu. The planes have vertical takeoff and landing capability. And allowing them to operate from assault ships. The defense ministry says the deployment is part of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia.

Now meanwhile, Japan has reaffirmed ties with The Philippines during a visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He is the first head of government to go to the Phillipines under President Rodrigo Duterte. And this is the pair taking part in a ceremony in Mr. Duterte's hometown.

During the trip, the leaders reiterated their commitment to promote peace in the region.

Now, this is News Stream. Still to come on the program, from Twitter diplomacy to a comparison with Elon Musk, Donald Trump's billionaire tech backer talks about his views of the incoming president.

(HEADLINES)

[08:30:37] LU STOUT: Now, you know the saying, a picture tells 1,000 words and this image is no exception. Now, the woman you see here is far right French politician Marie Le Pen, but it is where the leader of the National Front was sitting on Thursday that is causing a stir.

Le Pen is in Trump Tower, and Donald Trump's team says that they didn't meet with Le Pen and neither did the president-elect. Le Pen has publicly welcomed Trump's election and is one of the leading candidates for the French presidency this year. And this sighting happened as France' left-wing candidates held their first debate.

Jim Bittermann is following all of this from Paris. He joins us now. Jim, so Le Pen was spotted at Trump Tower. No word on whether she actually met with Donald Trump or his team, so what are we supposed to take away from this?

JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORREPSONDENT: Well, in fact, Le Pen's people say that she did not meet with Donald Trump, and Donald Trump people say the same thing. So there apparently was not a meeting, but there was was a meeting between Le Pen and somebody who lives three floors below Donald Trump, and that is this Italian businessman who has been kind of an intermediary between populist movements in Europe and the Trump campaign in the United States. And it's very possible that they did talk about a potential meeting with Trump down the line.

It's also very possible that they were talking about fund-raising, because Le Pen has made no bones about the fact that she needs more money for her election campaign and that she's not hesitant to consult with banks in the United States, or she said in Europe or even in Russia if necessary to find the money.

One of the things, though, is that she and Donald Trump see eye to eye on a lot of different issues. Here's what she told my Melissa Bell, colleague, here in Paris just a few weeks ago.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARINE LE PEN, NATIONAL FRONT LEADER (through translator): His willingness to break with the idea that USA has to police the world and the dramatic consequences this brings about in terms of migration flows, which we are suffering from. Also, his vision of an economy that will be more protectionist and his stance against the Transatlantic free trade agreement, which I'm also opposed to.

He is the anti-system candidate. The entire system was against him and wanted Hillary Clinton. This victory shows that the people are taking their future back.

BITTERMANN: So, in fact a lot of convergence of views there, Kristie.

LU STOUT: Yeah, absolutely.

Now on the other side of the French political spectrum, we know that left wing candidates, they had their first debate on Thursday. How did that go? Which candidate performed the strongest?

BITTERMANN: Well, there's little contradiction in the polls on that. There were some instant polls right after last night's televised debates. It's the first of four debates that are going to take place. And there are seven candidates, five of whom are known to the French voters, because they have served in -- in various capacities in French governments, but perhaps the one who did the best, according to most of the polls is Manuel Valls, who is the former prime minister here, and he came in the strongest on a number of different issues.

But people said in general that the debate last night was kind of lame, basically, that the candidates were too well behaved and there were no punchups or anything or kind of contradictions that were really very strong. They will have another chance on Sunday night to correct that.

It should be said, too, that the Socialist candidate, the best Socialist candidate in the national polling, this would be Manuel Valls, in the national polling when he's pitted against the other candidates that are running nationally, only comes in at fifth place. So the Socialists really have a lot of work to do here between now and the elections three and a half months from now, mainly because of the five years of President Hollande -- Kristie.

LU STOUT: All right. And we'll see if there's going to be fireworks at the next debate on Sunday. Jim Bittermann reporting, thank you.

The U.S. president-elect has the firm support of a powerful support in the tech industry, billionaire investor Peter Thiel joined the transition team just days after the election, and recently he opened up to The New York Times about his thoughts on the incoming president.

Now, here are a couple of standout quotes from the piece. Now, when asked if Trump is similar to the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Elon Musk, Thiel said this, quote, they are similar, actually. They are both grandmaster level salespeople. And these are very much larger than life figures.""

Now, next he talked about Donald Trump's use of Twitter, so-called Twitter diplomacy and whether he worries an intemperate tweet could spark a war with North Korea. Now, on that matter, Thiel said this, quote, ""a Twitter war is not a real war.""

Now, turning from politics to a scandal engulfing one of the world's largest car companies. Fiat Chrysler is the latest maker to be accused of cheating on emissions tests. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says the company used hidden software that allowed diesel emissions to exceed legal levels. More than 100,000 vehicles made between 2014 and 2016 are in question. Fiat Chrysler says it will fight those allegations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

[08:35:33] SERGIO MARCHIONNE, CEO, FIAT CHRYSLER: We have had discussions now with the EPA on this matter since September of 2015, so it's been more than a year and a half. We have made tons of material available to them. We continue to discuss the issue, and were in the process now of presenting a more complete set of control strategies that will remedy all of their concerns. So the issue could have been settled and should have been settled I think in my view in -- in a more efficient way and a more business like manner as opposed to elevating this to suggestions that we're trying to defraud anybody.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: Now, just this week Volkswagen paid $4.3 billion to settle charges of cheating on emissions tests with more than half a million diesel cars in the U.S.

Now, if you are a Nintendo fan, remember to mark your calendar. The Nintendo Switch is going on around the world on March 3 for $300. It is the company's latest handheld system that can turn into a home console.

And fans got a sneak peek at the incredible lineup of games designed for it on Friday. The beloved Mario and Zelda franchises are getting brand new entries, and there are also fresh titles that showed off the console's hardware.

The reveal got fans all over the world hyped up, but Rob Fahey, from Gameindustry.biz told us what Nintendo needs to do to make sure the Switch is a success.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROB FAHEY, GAMEINDUSTRY.BOZ: Probably the strongest lineup that Nintendo has had for a console launch really since I can remember. The fact is well that they have focused an awful lot on the controllers and the capabilities of the controllers really harks back to the Wii and what they did right with the Wii.

I thought that, again, that they were going to talk more about the screen and the portability of it, but that actually seems now just to be a thing that the console does rather than its primary selling point and that's probably a very good move on their part. I think the problem that they have is that their hardare is generally not seen as being as premium as something that Sony or a Microsoft might release, and they are going to be trying to sell it for around the same price point.

It won't hurt their launch. Their launch is going go out to a crowd of people who are very dedicated to Nintendo and who would buy this regardless of price, but I think that they might have to try to reduce that price point a little bit, maybe even by the end of this year, but certainly coming into next year.

LU STOUT: Got you. So the controller is a key feature but selling point, the pricetag could be a little bit too high, that was according to Rob Fahey from Gameindustry.biz.

You're watching News Stream right here on CNN. And straight ahead, forgiveness for the most unspeakable of crimes: a holocaust survivor's brave an selfless act. We reflect on her story as part of CNN's new series called ""My Hero.""

[08:40:00] LU STOUT: Welcome back.

Now, this week CNN is kicking off a new series, it's called ""My Hero"" where our anchors and correspondents look back on those they have met who have left lasting impressions.

Up first, up first is our Max Foster who reflects on a touching interview he did with a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. It's one that he considers his most memorable.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNAITONAL CORRESPONDENT: There was an extraordinary interview that I did earlier in the year which absolutely sticks in my mind and in everyone's mind who was there, I think, and that was with someone called Eva Kohr.

Now, she was at the Auschwitz concentration camp.

You were only saved because you're a twin, right? That's the only reason you're here.

EVA KOHR, HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR: That correct, because they noticed that Miriam and I looked alike.

FOSTER: There's this a remarkable point in her story where she 50 years later goes back to Auschwitz, which must have been very hard in itself and she's standing next to a Nazi doctor. And she asked him to document everything that he knew about the gas chamber. So this for the first time was firsthand evidence what have happened in there and she used it against the holocaust deniers.

But then she wanted to thank him for that because that was a very big thing for him to do.

KOHR: Hereby give amnesty.

FOSTER: And she decided to write him a letter and took her four years to write, because it was this forgiveness letter.

KOHR: I ultimately came up with a gift of forgiving him. That was my gift to him, but it became a gift to me, too.

I was finally free what of happened in Auschwitz emotionally. I was in charge of my own feelings.

FOSTER: The fact that she was so willing to open up and talk about something so horrific is one thing, but then to do it for a reason, which isn't just to tell her story. It's absolutely not a selfish process. And it can't be easy for her doing what she's doing, but she's doing it to give her something back to the world.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

LU STOUT: Wow. The gift of forgiveness after such an unspeakable crime. What an amazing woman there.

Now, happening right now, high above the Earth, we've got two astronauts that are performing a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to upgrade its power system. NASA says this space walk is scheduled to last about six-and-a-half hours. And what they are doing is installing adapter plates and hooking up the remaining three of six new lithium ion batteries. Now, these batteries store electrical energy generated by the station's solar panels.

Now, back here on Earth but inspired by a galaxy far, far away scientists are naming a new species of primate after a Star Wars character.

The Skywalker Hulak Gibbon was discovered in China nine years ago but researchers only confirmed it as a new species recently. It is endangered and facing extinction with fewer than 200 of them in the wild. And the ape is named after Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker, because of the way the gibbons move through the treetops.

And that is News Stream. I'm Kristie Lu Stout. World Sport with Amanda Davies is next.

2441074945,"(CNN)SpaceX returned to flight Saturday after a 4½-month hiatus.

The private space exploration company headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:54 a.m. PT, taking 10 satellites into space for voice and data company Iridium.

It marked the company's first launch since a Falcon 9 rocket exploded at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in September.

The launch's success Saturday was made even sweeter by a smooth return landing for the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage booster. It safely returned from space and glided to a landing on a seafaring platform, known as a drone ship.

SpaceX has been attempting to perfect the rocket landing -- along with rivals such as Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Because rockets are worth tens of millions of dollars, and they have historically been discarded after launch, mastering the landing is key to making space travel more affordable.

Saturday's launch marks the seventh time SpaceX has successfully landed a rocket.
A little more than an hour after launch, Musk announced that all 10 Iridium satellites were successfully deployed into orbit. Iridium is using the satellites to develop a revamped voice and data communications network, dubbed NEXT.

About 80 Iridium NEXT satellites are scheduled to be deployed, and SpaceX is committed to carrying at least 70 of them. Iridium says the NEXT satellites, delivered to low Earth orbit, are designed to provide ""real time connections between people, organizations and assets to and from anywhere.""

Iridium says NEXT ""will replace the world's largest commercial satellite network of low-Earth orbit satellites in what will be one of the largest 'tech upgrades in history.'""

SpaceX's highly anticipated launch was initially scheduled for Monday, but flight plans were canceled because of high winds and rain.

In September, a rocket carrying a satellite to be used by Facebook to bring Internet access to remote areas of the world exploded while awaiting launch.

Facebook is in a partnership with French satellite firm Eutelsat Communications. The satellite, called Amos 6, was owned by Israeli company Spacecom.

Earlier this month, a probe into the cause of the blast concluded that a failed pressure vessel in a liquid oxygen tank was to blame for the failure."
2441102728,"A SpaceX rocket will take to the skies today (Jan. 14) for the first time since a Sept. 1 launchpad explosion, and you can watch the highly anticipated liftoff live.

SpaceX's two-stage Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to launch 10 communications satellites for the company Iridium into low-Earth orbit today, with liftoff from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base targeted for 12:54 p.m. EST (1754 GMT; 9:54 a.m. local California time). You can watch it live here at Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX.

You can also follow the launch directly via SpaceX at http://www.spacex.com/webcast or https://www.youtube.com/user/spacexchannel.

The 10 satellites are the first of a planned 70 that SpaceX plans to loft for Iridium's new NEXT constellation over a series of seven launches. This network will replace the constellation of 66 spacecraft that Iridium currently operates in low-Earth orbit, company representatives have said.

Today's liftoff - which was pushed back from Jan. 9 because of bad weather and issues with launch-site availability - will also include some action in the downward direction. SpaceX plans to try to land the Falcon 9's first stage on a robotic ""drone ship"" stationed in the Pacific Ocean, as part of the company's effort to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets. This is a priority for SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, who has said that such technology will slash the cost of spaceflight and help open the heavens to exploration.

The Sept. 1 explosion, which occurred during a routine prelaunch test of a Falcon 9, destroyed the rocket and the $200 million Amos-6 communications satellite. SpaceX investigators traced the cause of the accident to the failure of a high-pressure helium tank inside the Falcon 9's upper stage.

SpaceX announced earlier this month that it had wrapped up its mishap investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration has accepted the results of the inquiry and has granted SpaceX a launch license that covers the seven liftoffs required to loft the 70 Iridium-NEXT satellites from Vandenberg.

2441111569,"A SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off from California on Saturday, returning the company to flight for the first time since a fiery launchpad explosion in September. The 230-foot (70-meter) rocket launched from VandenbergAir Force Base at 9:54 a.m. PST (1754 GMT) to deliver 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc.

""It's a clean sweep - 10 for 10,"" SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said after the satellites were released. SpaceX founder and entrepreneur Elon Musk's ambitious flight plans had been grounded since the Sept. 1 explosion during fueling ahead of a pre-flight test in Florida.

About 10 minutes after Saturday's launch, the first stage of the rocket, which had separated from the rest of craft, successfully touched down on a platform in the Pacific Ocean, a feat previously accomplished by four other returning Falcon rockets. SpaceX intends to reuse its rockets to cut costs.

""Rocket is stable,"" Musk posted on Twitter. ""Mission looks good.""

Two other returning Falcon boosters landed on the ground.

The mission tested changes implemented by SpaceExploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, since the launchpad explosion.

Accident investigators determined that a canister of helium burst inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen tank, triggering the explosion. The canister is being redesigned, but until then SpaceX is addressing the issue by modifying its fueling procedures.

The explosion destroyed a $62 million SpaceX booster and a$200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to put into orbit two days later.

The accident clouded the company's aggressive agenda, which includes beginning to ferry U.S. astronauts into space next year, when it also plans to make its first voyage to Mars.

Saturday's flight begins to clear a logjam of more than 70 planned missions, worth more than $10 billion, involving SpaceX Falcon rockets, which last flew in August, SpaceX said.

The launch is the first in a seven-flight contract with Iridium worth $468.1 million, company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said.

SpaceX aims to launch 27 rockets in 2017, more than triple the eight flights the privately held firm managed in 2016, according to a report on Friday in the Wall Street Journal.

In addition to its dozens of commercial customers, SpaceX is one of two companies hired by NASA to fly cargo to the International Space Station.

The company's 2017 agenda includes the debut launch of a heavy-lift booster, flying its first reused rocket and repairing the Florida launchpad damaged in the explosion."

Barely four and a half months after another Falcon 9 and its $200 million Israeli commercial payload were suddenly destroyed during a prelaunch fueling test on the Florida Space Coast on Sept. 1, 2016, SpaceX says all systems are GO for the 'Return to Flight' launch of a new Falcon 9 on the Iridium-1 mission from the California coast tomorrow.

Another launch failure would deal a devastating blow to confidence in SpaceX's hard won reputation - so 'Failure is Not an Option' as they say in the space business.

The Sept. 1, 2016 calamity was the second Falcon 9 failure within 15 months time. Both occurred inside the second stage and called into question the rockets reliability.

The 229-foot (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket has been rolled out from its processing hangar to the launch pad and raised vertically.

""Beautiful picture of our ride to space tomorrow on the launch pad this morning!"" tweeted Matt Desch, Iridium Communications CEO, featuring the lead photo in this story.

A license for permission to proceed with the launch originally last Sunday was only granted by the FAA last Friday, Jan. 6. But poor California weather in the form of stormy rains and high winds forced further delays to Saturday.

Today, Friday the 13th, it's T-Minus 1 Day to the inaugural launch of the advanced Iridium NEXT voice and data relay satellites.

Liftoff of the SpaceX Falcon 9 with the payload of 10 identical next generation Iridium NEXT communications satellites is slated for 9:54:39 am PST or 5:54:39 pm UTC from Space Launch Complex 4E on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

The Iridium 1 mission only has an instantaneous launch opportunity precisely at 9:54:34 a.m. PST or 12:54:34 p.m. EST.

You can watch the launch live via a SpaceX webcast starting about 20 minutes prior to the planned liftoff time:

The launch will be broadcast at : http://www.spacex.com/webcast

Weather forecasters currently predict about a 60 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time.

Sunday, Jan. 15 is available as a back-up launch opportunity in case of a delay for any reason including technical and weather related issues.

""The teams from Iridium, SpaceX and our partners are in the homestretch for the first launch of the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation,"" said satellite owner Iridium Communications.

Meanwhile the launch teams have completed the countdown dress rehearsal' and Launch Readiness Review in anticipation of the morning liftoff.

""Final preparations are being made for tomorrow's inaugural launch, and with that comes a number of high-stakes verifications, involving all parties. Traditionally referred to as the 'countdown dress rehearsal' and 'Launch Readiness Review' (LRR), these milestones represent the final hurdles to clearing the path for the January 14th launch.""

""The countdown dress rehearsal and LRR include several prelaunch inspections and quality control measures. These include final clearances for the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Iridium NEXT payload, SpaceX and Iridium® ground infrastructure and associated team member responsibilities.""

Iridium says that every precaution has been taken to ensure a successful launch.

""There are so many variables that need to be considered when finalizing launch preparations, and a slight deviation or unexpected behavior by any of them can jeopardize the launch integrity,"" said Iridium COO Scott Smith, in a statement.

""We've perfected the necessary procedures, taken every precaution we can imagine, and tomorrow, after what has felt like centuries, we'll take the first step on a long-awaited journey to revolutionize satellite communications. The success of today's events has brought us to an apex moment.""

Iridium 1 is the first of seven planned Falcon 9 launches to establish the Iridium NEXT constellation which will eventually consist of 81 advanced satellites.

At least 70 will be launched by SpaceX.

The inaugural launch of the advanced Iridium NEXT satellites will start the process of replacing an aging Iridium fleet in orbit for nearly two decades.

After the Sept .1 calamity SpaceX conducted a four month long investigation seeking to determine the root cause.

And it was just last Friday, Jan. 6, that the FAA finally granted SpaceX a license to launch the 'Return to Flight' Falcon 9 mission - as I confirmed with the FAA.

""The FAA accepted the investigation report on the AMOS-6 mishap and has closed the investigation,"" FAA spokesman Hank Price confirmed to Universe Today.

""SpaceX applied for a license to launch the Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The FAA has granted a license for that purpose.""

The SpaceX investigation report into the total loss of the Falcon 9 rocket and AMOS-6 payload has not been released at this time. The FAA has oversight responsibility to encourage, facilitate, and promote U.S. commercial space transportation and ensure the protection of public safety.

In addition to the launch, SpaceX plans to continue its secondary objective of recovering the Falcon 9 first stage via a propulsive soft landing - as done several times previously and witnessed by this author.

The Iridium-1 mission patch featured herein highlights both the launch and landing objectives.

The goal is to eventually recycle and reuse the first stage - and thereby dramatically slash launch costs per Musk's vision.

This Falcon 9 has been outfitted with four landing legs and grid fins for a controlled landing on a tiny barge prepositioned in the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles off the west coast of California.

2441141559,"Today SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket, for the first time since the September 1st accident that destroyed another vehicle during a test firing. After months of investigation, SpaceX finally said it had found the cause of that accident earlier this month, and was then given permission to resume launches.

The launch, at California's Vandenburg Air Force Base, is expected at 12:54 p.m. EST, and SpaceX will stream it live here starting a little before that.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.

The rocket's payload will be 10 satellites to be deployed for the communications firm Iridium. But there will be a lot more riding on the launch than that-the future of the company, and, without too much hyperbole, the human race.

Here's why. Obviously, halting services for more than four months is no good for any business. A report Friday from the Wall Street Journal claimed that a previous accident and fleet grounding in 2015 led to a quarter-billion dollar annual loss that year.

The numbers for 2016 are probably just as bad, since, according to the Journal, the September accident pushed half of the company's planned 2016 launches off its schedule. SpaceX has removed claims that it is ""profitable and cash-flow positive"" from its website.

SpaceX officials told the Journal that the company has more than $1 billion cash on hand and no debt, as well as a long line of customers waiting for future launches.

But we've already seen that accidents can push away customers. Britain's Inmarsat pulled one launch order in early December. Inmarsat officials said it was more an issue of scheduling than any mistrust of SpaceX's reliability, though, and the company still has another launch order with SpaceX for the middle of this year.

The September accident also put the brakes on one of SpaceX's most important long-term strategic goals-proving that it can re-use its rockets. The first launch of a recovered rocket booster was previously scheduled for late 2016, but that never happened. SpaceX has to get re-using rockets back on the agenda soon-while its launches are already a bargain compared to competing space services', reusing its rockets would push those prices down even further, giving it a massive edge for the long term.

Any signs of trouble today, then, would have huge consequences both for the company's fundamentals, and the feasibility of Elon Musk's most aggressive goal-colonizing Mars. Musk wants to get humans to the Red Planet by 2024, and to do that, the company needs to generate consistent profits to fund development of its next generation of rockets.

Another revelation from WSJ's Friday report was that even winning the satellite-launch market might not be enough. The company plans to derive a much more of its future revenue-and, in turn, development funds-from a satellite internet service.But reliable, affordable rockets would still be the company's most fundamental asset. Today's launch has to prove SpaceX can provide them."

Satellite passes are visible when an object flying overhead is still illuminated by the sun, and when the sun is below the horizon on the ground. Occasionally, a spacecraft will brighten when sunlight bounces off a reflective surface, like a solar array or antenna.

Unlike other objects in orbit around Earth, flares from Iridium's Lockheed Martin-built relay craft are highly predictable - to the second - giving observers advance notice of when and where to look.

The first-generation Iridium satellites have three antenna panels mounted at an angle to the craft's main body. Each one is highly reflective and treated with silver-coated Teflon.

When the sun strikes one of the antennas just right, a flare is visible from the ground. An observer positioned in the right place at the right time will see a sudden brightening of the satellite as it soars across the sky.

The flares sometimes get as bright as -8 magnitude, brighter than the crescent moon, and last up to 20 seconds. The most brilliant flares can even be seen in daylight.

The long axis of the first-generation satellites always points directly to Earth at an altitude of 485 miles (780 kilometers). Savvy observers can calculate when the flares will occur and where to look by knowing the location of the spacecraft and the sun.

If math isn't your thing, you can look up flares for your location at Heavens-Above.com by entering your observing site, and clicking on Iridium flares.

The flares are a design fluke, and Iridium's new generation of communications satellites will not produce the phenomena.

There are normally 66 operational satellites in the Iridium fleet spread uniformly around the globe in six orbital lanes. The company's satellites launched from 1997 through 2002, and were originally designed to function for just eight years.

Iridium says 64 members of the 66-satellite constellation are still active, relaying messages, voice calls and data around the world through inter-satellite links and ground stations for the company's nearly 850,000 subscribers.

With an aging network, Iridium is about to launch the first batch of ""Iridium Next"" satellites as soon as Saturday to upgrade and replenish the fleet.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry 10 of the satellites, which use a single antenna and are of an entirely new design, into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

""Due to design improvements, our new satellites unfortunately are not expected to create flares, so enjoy Iridium flares while you can,"" Iridium says on its website. ""The new antennas offer increased data speed and capacity but are angled differently than the current design, and are therefore not likely to reflect much sunlight.""

The new satellites will replace the existing members of Iridium's network one-by-one.

Once a fresh satellite is turned on and confirmed healthy, the old satellite will be removed from the fleet. In most cases, the retired craft will be de-orbited to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, assuming it has enough leftover fuel for the maneuvers.

The $3 billion replacement program should be complete by mid-2018, when Iridium flares will be a thing of the past."

2441213486,"Four months since one of its rockets caught fire on the launch pad, Elon Musk's SpaceX plans to launch 10 Iridium satellites today at 9:54 am PST (12:54 pm EST, 5:54 pm GMT).

Watch their live video stream of the launch here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTmbSur4fcs

The launch had been delayed six days due to violent weather at the launch site, Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California. The company has been working feverishly to return to flight since a Falcon 9 rocket caught fire during fueling before a routine engine test in September 2016.

Last week, the company announced that it had identified the cause of the fire, a highly-pressurized tank stressed by a innovative super-cool propellant loading procedure. SpaceX's decision to return to a more reliable approach convinced US regulators to grant them a new launch license for this effort.

Just yesterday, internal financial documents leaked to the Wall Street Journal demonstrated the importance of today's launch to the company's bottom-line: a six-month interruption in launches cost SpaceX a quarter of a billion dollars in 2015; the current interruption is likely entails similar losses.

Though the company says its financial position remains strong, with plenty of cash on hand and no debt, the need to resume generating revenue-and move forward on an array of new projects-is pressing.

2441235005,"It's back to business for the private spaceflight company. 2016 was a fairly good year for SpaceX, with Elon Musk's spaceflight company inching closer to developing a reusable rocket for missions. At least up until September, when a Falcon 9 rocket exploded during a pre-launch test on the pad at Cape Canaveral. The company quickly investigated and found that the craft's liquid oxygen had leaked out of a tank, with the resulting friction causing ignition. At last, however, SpaceX is ready to turn a corner: the private outfit has returned to flight by launching a Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, delivering 10 Iridium Next satellites into orbit. The launch also included a successful landing of the Falcon 9's first stage aboard a SpaceX drone ship, Just Read the Instructions -- the first time a rocket has landed on the vessel, in fact. While this isn't the first-ever drone ship landing, it's clearly another feather in Elon Musk's cap.

Launch moving due to high winds and rains at Vandenberg. Other range conflicts this week results in next available launch date being Jan 14.

- SpaceX (@SpaceX) January 8, 2017

The company had planned to get back into the business of shooting things into space by December, but that date was pushed back to January. Between then and now, SpaceX has continued to test the safety of its setup and received reauthorization from the FAA. Unfortunately, poor weather had led to another postponement until today.

The launch is crucial to both Iridium and SpaceX, as you might guess. For Iridium, this is the first step toward completing a constellation of 70-plus satellites that will blanket the Earth with coverage. It's arguably much more important for SpaceX, though. The September incident shook confidence in the company's ability to reliably deliver payloads to space. This isn't a guarantee that everything is back to normal (that will take months or even years), but it's reassuring for satellite makers, NASA and other organizations that want to lean on SpaceX as a partner."
2441238622,"Following today's rocket launch , SpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 on the company's drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. It's the first landing SpaceX has done since August, and the fifth time one of these vehicles has landed at sea. The feat brings the total number of recovered SpaceX rockets to seven, as two other Falcon 9 vehicles have successfully touched down on solid ground after a launch.

The company has been on a hiatus from spaceflight, after one of its Falcon 9s exploded on a launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, in September. During a routine fueling procedure, the vehicle suddenly ignited in a giant fireball, which destroyed both the rocket and the satellite it was supposed to carry into space. The accident temporarily halted all Falcon 9 launches - and thus, landings.

But now that SpaceX is back to launching rockets again, the company is back to landing them too. And that puts SpaceX back in a position to finally reuse one of these reusable vehicles. Originally, SpaceX had been aiming to launch a landed rocket for the first time in fall of 2016, but the launchpad explosion put those plans on pause.

SpaceX had already picked out which vehicle it wanted to use, too. The company planned to fly the Falcon 9 that sent cargo to the International Space Station in April - and the vehicle that became the first to land successfully on a drone ship at sea. That vehicle was supposed to launch a satellite for the Luxembourg-based company SES , which has been eager to launch on the first reused rocket.

It's unclear if those plans have changed in the wake of the accident. But the whole point of landing these rockets is to use them again in order to bring down the cost of access to space. Typically, rockets go unrecovered after a flight, which means an entirely new vehicle has to be made for each mission. Saving the majority of a rocket has the potential to bring down manufacturing costs, but the long-term benefits of reusability only start to kick in if the rockets are used again as much - and as frequently - as possible.

And SpaceX seems to be in need of ways to cut costs. The company lost $260 million and had a 6 percent drop in revenue in 2015, according to financial reports obtained by the Wall Street Journal . Those losses came after one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets disintegrated en route to the International Space Station in June of that year, causing the company to delay its launches for six months.

The company is likely experiencing similar budget issues now after the September 2016 explosion. Meanwhile, SpaceX has high hopes that its planned constellation of internet-beaming satellites will bring in more than $30 billion in revenue by 2025. Those plans are still in development, though, and a factory hasn't been built yet.

Still, all signs point to SpaceX having a busy year ahead. Those financial reports reported by the WSJ revealed that SpaceX had planned to launch 20 rockets in 2016 and 27 rockets this year. Since only eight rockets flew last year, SpaceX has a lot of customers that need to get into space in 2017. So it's possible we could see many more landings - and a few previously flown rockets - flying again soon.

"
2441238707,"Just months after a launch pad explosion thwarted its last attempt, SpaceX has successfully launched an unmanned rocket into orbit. The launch, which unfolded Saturday at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, marked a crucial - and expensive - test for the private space company in the aftermath of its recent, very visible misfire.

Shortly after the launch, the two-stage rocket detached its first stage, which subsequently landed safely on a platform in the Pacific Ocean.

SpaceX live-streamed the entire process along the way. You can watch it here or play the video embedded at the top of this post.

The Falcon 9 rocket is bearing 10 commercial satellites for Iridium Communications, which currently operates a network of dozens of mobile communications satellites in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is under contract with Iridium to launch at least 70 satellites into orbit in a series of seven launches for the company - beginning with Saturday's batch.

The new satellites will replace the current network, in ""what will be one of the largest 'tech upgrades' in history,"" according to a press release from SpaceX.

Still, a cloud of uncertainty hung over the launch, after an explosion left a wreckage of last September's test in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said at the time that the blast came while workers were still loading propellant into the rocket, though no one was physically harmed in the accident.

In addition to destroying the rocket itself - a Falcon 9, like the rocket being launched Saturday - last year's blast also obliterated a $200 million communications satellite. The Israeli satellite ""had been leased by Facebook as part of a project to bring high-speed internet to parts of Africa,"" NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports for our Newscast unit.

A months-long investigation by SpaceX dug into what went wrong - ""the toughest puzzle to solve that we've ever had to solve,"" Musk said. That probe wrapped up earlier this month, concluding the accident ""was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank,"" according to CBS News.

The Federal Aviation Administration then signed off on that investigation, approving the new licence for Saturday's launch.

Prior to last year's accident, SpaceX had managed a string of high-profile successes, including landing a Falcon 9 on a floating barge."
2441240160,"Space Exploration Technologies Corp. returned to the skies on Saturday with a launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's central coast, marking the company's first flight since a Sept. 1 fireball destroyed a rocket and its payload on a Florida launch pad.

A Falcon 9 rocket carrying several Iridium communications satellites rumbled aloft shortly after 9:54 a.m. California time, amid clear skies.

The successful launch was crucial because SpaceX has a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to send astronauts to the International Space Station and is targeting November for the first demonstration flight.

SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla Motors Inc., founded SpaceX 15 years ago with the express goal of sending humans to Mars. The company makes rockets at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and has contracts to launch commercial satellites as well as fly missions for NASA and the U.S. military.

SpaceX has been awarded NASA contracts valued at $4.2 billion to resupply the International Space Station via its unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ultimately ferry astronauts to the station from the U.S.

The satellites aboard the Falcon 9 rocket this time are part of the Iridium NEXT constellation network, providing new and better communications services. Iridium Communications Inc. , based in McLean, Virginia, is counting on SpaceX to take 70 new satellites into orbit with seven separate launches over the next 14 to 18 months.

SpaceX plans to recover the rocket's first stage on an unmanned drone ship bobbing in the ocean, a feat it accomplished four times in 2

"
2441240492,"SpaceX has succeeded in launch a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, its first launch since a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launch pad in pre-flight procedures in September 2016. The launch took place at 9:54 AM PT Saturday, during an instant launch window. It's a huge victory for SpaceX, which has had to delay its launch schedule since the explosion.

The launch also resulted in a successful recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, which marks the seventh time SpaceX has succeed in landing this stage back for potential later re-use. SpaceX's second-stage also successfully reached low-earth orbit, where it will begin the next stage of the mission, deploying Iridium's 10 satellites.

This mission is the first in a series for client Iridium, that will see it deploy 70 satellites in a network for voice and data communication. It's also a green light for SpaceX in terms of the company pursuing its aggressive launch schedule, which is something the private launch provider needs to do in order to continue locking in new contracts and working towards its goal of decreasing the cost of launches even further still.

In 2016, SpaceX completed only 8 of a planned 20 launches, due to the September 1 explosion that halted all new launches for four months. That has not been good for the company's bottom line, resulting in a year that likely saw it exacerbate a reported $250 million loss in 2015.

SpaceX also had to push back its timelines for test launches of its Dragon crew capsule as a result of the September incident. The original target date for a Dragon test launch with people on board was 2017, but it's now been pushed back to 2018. The company still hopes to fly a mission without crew on board by the last quarter of this year, however.

Crewed mission capabilities will help SpaceX expand its ability to serve contracts, since it can then serve the ISS for more than just supply runs. It also sets the stage for SpaceX's future goals of providing missions to Mars, with a target initial date for those aspirations still set for 2024.

SpaceX successfully began deploying the Iridium NEXT satellites as of around 11 AM PT/2 PM ET. All satellites were successfully deployed as of 11:13 AM PT / 2:12 PM PT, signalling a successful mission for the space company's first flight back."
2441240495,"SpaceX successfully recovered its first stage Falcon 9 rocket during a launch on Saturday, marking the 7th rocket recovered overall, and the first one for this drone landing barge, Just Read The Instructions. The recovery was captured on video from the rocket's perspective, too, so you can see the entire process as it touches down.

The first time SpaceX successfully recovered a Falcon 9 first stage at sea using a drone ship was on April 8, 2016, and the last time was in August, during a launch that preceeded the September 1 explosion. It has recovered a total of five first stages using autonomous barges, which correct themselves for sea conditions and coordinate with the rocket for successful recoveries.

Recovering these stages is key to SpaceX's mission of bringing down the cost of space flight, which serves its larger goal of making humanity an interplanetary species. Spacex currently charges around $60 million on average for a launch, which is drastically less than its competitors in the commercial spaceflight industry - but it enjoys only very thin margins on each launch as a result.

Re-using Falcon 9 first stage components for multiple missions would greatly increase its ability to make money on each individual launch, since you don't have to then build an entirely new rocket every time you want to send something into space. SpaceX isn't yet re-using the first stage Falcon 9 rocket sections it recovers, but it is studying them to help maximize the efficacy of the recovery process, and it said today that it plans to run its first mission with a recovered rocket stage sometime ""soon."""

2441240934,"For the first time since the launch pad explosion in Sept. 2016 , SpaceX launched the Iridium-NEXT communications satellites on January 14, 2016. SpaceX successfully landed the rocket's first stage on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. [Full Story]"
2441249702,"VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - SpaceX launched 10 satellites to orbit today (Jan. 14) in a rousing return-to-flight mission that also included a rocket landing on a ship at sea.

SpaceX's two-stage Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from a launch pad just a few hundred meters from the scenic California coastline here today at 12:54 p.m. EST (1754 GMT; 9:54 a.m. local California time), carrying 10 communications satellites to low-Earth orbit for the Virginia-based company Iridium. After a week of heavy rain and strong winds, only a few clouds obscured the view of the rocket as it climbed skyward.

Deployment of the satellites began 59 minutes after liftoff and took about 15 minutes, SpaceX representatives said. [Photos: SpaceX's Return-to-Flight Rocket Launch and Landing Success]

This success was critically important to SpaceX, which is bouncing back from a Sept. 1 launch pad explosion that destroyed a Falcon 9 and its payload, the $200 million Amos-6 communications satellite. The company had been grounded until today, as it investigated the accident and worked to ensure that something similar doesn't happen again.

Rocket landing, too

Not all of today's action was in the skyward direction. A few minutes after launch, the Falcon 9's first stage separated from the upper stage, then headed back down to Earth to attempt a touchdown on ""Just Read the Instructions,"" one of SpaceX's two robotic ""drone ships,"" which was stationed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.

The rocket stuck the landing eight minutes after lifting off. SpaceX has now pulled off seven such touchdowns during orbital launches, with five coming on drone ships and two rockets flying back to their launch sites on terra firma. (The previous six landings all occurred after launches from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, between December 2015 and August 2016.)

These rocket touchdowns are part of SpaceX's effort to develop fully and rapidly reusable launch vehicles, a key priority for SpaceX's billionaire founder and CEO, Elon Musk. Such technology could cut the cost of launches dramatically, potentially enabling much greater access to space, Musk has said.

 
The first satellites in a new constellation

While the rocket landing was dramatic, the main goal today is to loft the 1,896-lb. (860 kilograms) satellites, which are the first 10 members of Iridium's planned 70-spacecraft ""NEXT"" constellation. The other 60 will also ride Falcon 9 rockets to orbit out of Vandenberg, on a series of six more launches.

NEXT will eventually replace Iridium's current communications network, which consists of 66 satellites in low-Earth orbit, company representatives have said.

""Iridium NEXT will dramatically enhance Iridium's ability to meet the growing demand for global mobile communications on land, at sea and in the skies,"" Iridium representatives wrote in an online description of NEXT, which they said will be the world's largest commercial satellite constellation when it's up and running.

The French satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space designed the NEXT spacecraft, though each one is assembled and tested at an Arizona facility operated by Virginia-based company Orbital ATK.

Not the first return to flight

SpaceX has rebounded from failure before. In June 2015, a Falcon 9 broke apart shortly after launching the company's robotic Dragon cargo capsule on a resupply mission to the International Space Station for NASA.

SpaceX investigators determined that a faulty steel strut in the Falcon 9's upper stage caused that accident. A Falcon 9 didn't fly again until December 2015, when an upgraded version of the rocket delivered 11 satellites to orbit for customer Orbcomm - and also made the first-ever soft landing during an orbital launch.

The Sept. 1, 2016 explosion, which occurred during a routine pre-launch test at Cape Canaveral, initially puzzled SpaceX; about a week later, Musk described the incident as the ""most difficult and complex failure"" in the company's history. But technicians and engineers eventually traced the cause to the failure of a high-pressure helium vessel inside the Falcon 9's second-stage liquid-oxygen tank.

SpaceX announced earlier this month that it had wrapped up its investigation of the Sept. 1 accident. The Federal Aviation Administration accepted the results of the inquiry and granted SpaceX a license that covers all seven launches required to orbit the 70 Iridium-NEXT satellites.

Today's liftoff was originally scheduled for Monday (Jan. 9) but slipped because of bad weather and issues with launch-site availability, according to tweets sent out by SpaceX."
2441249705,"After being involuntarily grounded for over four months, SpaceX returned to space Saturday and nailed the rocket's re-entry landing on a drone ship in the Pacific.

Elon Musk's spaceflight company launched 10 satellites for wireless company Iridium aboard one of its Falcon 9 rockets, which lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

About 10 minutes after launch, the first stage of the rocket successfully returned and landed on a drone ship called ""Just Read the Instructions."" Video of the landing via a SpaceX webcast captured the entire descent, in which the Falcon 9 touched down nearly dead center on its landing pad target.

Typically, turbulence from the landing causes the live video feed to cut out, but the feed stayed with the entire landing on Saturday, offering a rare glimpse of the entire event.

The successful mission comes a little over a week after the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorized SpaceX's Commercial Space Transportation License. That license was suspended last September after a sudden and spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 during a prelaunch test at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

The rocket was destroyed along with a satellite Facebook had hoped to use to beam broadband internet to rural Africa.

The internet speculated wildly on possible causes for the explosion, pointing fingers at everything from sabotage to aliens .

In the end, though, an investigation team involving the FAA , the Air Force, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board, SpaceX and industry experts concluded that ""the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner, leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV,"" according to a statement earlier this month from SpaceX .

Translation: Something went wrong in the Falcon 9's complex fuel systems.

Saturday's launch was originally set for about a week earlier in the month, but that date was pushed back due to weather and conflicts with other activities at Vandenberg.

The new Iridium satellites that SpaceX delivered to low-earth orbit are part of the company's initiative to upgrade its current constellation of dozens of satellites."
2441249715,"SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifted off for the first time in five months, on a mission aimed at putting 10 advanced Iridium Next telecommunication sateliites in orbit.

Cheers went up from a crowd of hundreds of SpaceX employees at the company's headquarters as they watched the rocket ascend from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:54 a.m. PT. The cheers rose again minutes later when the Falcon 9's first stage landed on a drone ship in the Pacific for the first time.

Today's liftoff comes after a spectacular launch pad explosion on Sept. 1 that destroyed a different Falcon 9 and its $200 million Amos-6 satellite payload.

That blow-up forced a months-long suspension, during which SpaceX determined that the failure was caused by problems with a helium pressure vessel inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen tank. To head off those problems, SpaceX changed its fueling procedures and will eventually redesign the vessels.

In addition to marking SpaceX's return to flight, this mission marks the first deployment of Iridium's next-generation satellites. The satellites will be deployed, one by one, into a pole-to-pole orbit to provide mobile and data communication services.

SpaceX is due to put the 70-satellite constellation into place with seven launches over the course of the next year. Iridium Next is designed to deliver faster data transfer speeds and higher throughputs than Iridium's existing network, representing one of the largest ""tech upgrades"" in history.

During the eight minutes following launch, the rocket's second stage and its payload separated from the first-stage booster. While the second stage powered onward to orbit, the first stage went through a series of maneuvers to slow itself down from supersonic speeds and guide itself to an oceangoing drone ship.

The autonomous spaceport drone ship, christened ""Just Read the Instructions"" in homage to science-fiction author Iain M. Banks , was pre-positioned in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles offshore.

SpaceX has successfully landed a Falcon 9 booster six times, including two touchdowns at its ""Landing Zone 1"" in Florida and four times on a drone ship in the Atlantic. This was the first Pacific touchdown.

Meanwhile, launch commentator John Insprucker reported that the second stage was in the correct parking orbit to prepare for deploying Iridium's satellites.

Recovering and reusing rocket hardware is a key part of SpaceX's campaign to drive down the cost of access to space and clear the way for flights to Mars within the next decade . The first launch of a previously flown booster is expected to take place later this year.

That's not the only highlight on this year's agenda for SpaceX: The California-based company is also gearing up for the first launch of its Falcon Heavy super-rocket from Vandenberg, as well as its first uncrewed flight test of a Dragon space taxi that's eventually meant to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station."
2441250061,"After launching 10 Iridium-NEXT satellites , the Falcon 9 first stage landed on the ""Just Read The Instructions"" drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. This was the first time that this particular drone ship was used in a successful landing. [Full Story]"
2441250640,"Four months after a launch pad explosion, SpaceX returned to flight Saturday morning, delivering 10 satellites into orbit and landing its first-stage booster on a floating drone ship. 

Analysts had described the launch as ""all-important"" for the Hawthorne space company to reestablish customer confidence and momentum after a Sept. 1 launchpad explosion in Florida destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and a commercial communications satellite perched on top. But beyond the specter of the accident, stakes were high for Saturday's launch because it involved deploying the first 10 satellites of a new commercial constellation for well-known operator Iridium Communications Inc. 

The new satellites have more capability than their older counterparts, including higher data speeds. Saturday's launch is the first of seven that SpaceX will perform for Iridium to carry a total of 70 satellites into orbit. 

""There was a lot riding on this for SpaceX, but also for Iridium, and I think they can breathe a sigh of relief,"" said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group. 

The launch occurred at 9:54 a.m. Pacific time from Vandenberg Air Force Base, north of Santa Barbara. About eight minutes after liftoff, the first-stage rocket booster landed upright on a floating platform called ""Just Read the Instructions"" in the Pacific Ocean.

About an hour after the launch, company Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that the mission ""looks good."" By 11:15 a.m., Musk tweeted that all satellites had been successfully delivered to the correct orbit.

The launch comes after an investigation into the September explosion that was led by SpaceX and assisted by the U.S. Air Force, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board and industry experts, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration. The investigation concluded last week that the cause was the failure of a pressure vessel that stores cold helium to maintain pressure in the liquid oxygen tank.

The company said the failure of one of three such tanks, inside the rocket's larger, second-stage liquid oxygen tank, probably occurred after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel's aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited.

The FAA said last week that it accepted the accident report and closed the investigation. 

SpaceX said it would change the configuration of the vessels and change helium loading operations.

Every mission until about 2018 will be watched closely, as SpaceX and Boeing Co. are both contracted to build capsules to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.

NASA has said that the first uncrewed flight of SpaceX's spacecraft is set for November, and its first flight test with humans aboard is scheduled for May 2018. 

""Every mission will be crucial,"" Caceres said. ""But this one was particularly crucial because you don't want two failures in a row. So I think this was a huge success."""
2441250900,"At just before 1pm eastern time, SpaceX completed its first launch since September. The mission, which will put 10 satellites into low Earth orbit for the communications firm Iridium, appears to have been a complete success.

At crucial stages of the launch, which was live-streamed on YouTube, SpaceX mission control staff could be heard cheering wildly in the background. That included the stage after the successful separation of the first-stage booster and ignition of the second-stage engine, and the successful deployment of the first stage's guidance fins.

Within ten minutes of launch, the Falcon 9 rocket's first-stage booster successfully returned to Earth intact, with a clean landing on the drone barge Just Read the Instructions. This was the first successful landing on that vehicle, following several successful recoveries using its east-coast counterpart, the Of Course I Still Love You.

The second stage of the rocket is as of this writing still preparing to deploy its payload of satellites.

As we outlined earlier today, this launch was of crucial importance for SpaceX, following an accident in September that led to the suspension of launches for more than four months.

"
2441252176,"SpaceX today launched 10 Iridium satellites on its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket before flying the first stage of the rocket back to a floating landing platform in the Pacific.

This launch marks the first flight since a Falcon 9 rocket caught fire and was destroyed during a routine engine test in September, which left the company scrambling to assure clients and regulators that its technology is up to snuff. Today's launch brings the Falcon 9's success rate up to 28 in 30 flights since its debut in 2010.

The 10-satellite load is one of the heaviest cargos the company has flown to orbit, and while this is the seventh successful landing of the rocket's first stage, it is the first time SpaceX has done so after flying from its facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Since its debut, the Falcon 9 has provided a cheaper rocket than its incumbent competitors, allowing it to gain market share in at their expense. It has quickly won a major chunk of the commercial launch market and broke the Boeing-Lockheed Martin duopoly on US national-security launches. But a failed mission in 2015 and last year's fire both put a damper on the company's plans to move past the rocket on to new projects, forcing it to spend time and money perfecting the technology.

This latest successful launch should allow the company to start making inroads on its long list of contracts to launch rockets on behalf of commercial and government clients-the company's most important source of revenue-while returning its attention to its next set of projects, many of them now suffering under delays.

Topping the list is reusing the rocket stages like the one the company landed on its drone ship today. Re-flying those booster stages promises the cut the cost of SpaceX launches even further and put more pressure on its competitors, but it has to prove that both the original rockets and the ""flight-proven"" boosters are reliable. The company planned to launch a satellite for European operators SES towards the end of 2016; that launch is now expected to occur sometime this year.

Up next?

The company's next move is the long-promised Falcon Heavy rocket, which would essentially provide the power of three Falcon 9 rockets in one launch vehicle. The first flight test of the Heavy was delayed due to the two accidents, but the company expects to fly it this year. The first image of the rocket was published by SpaceX in December 2016.

The company also hopes to do the first unmanned test of its Dragon II spacecraft, which is being designed to fly astronauts for NASA starting with the first manned flight in 2018. Hitting that mark-and beating rival Boeing, which is competing for the same contract-will require a timely demonstration of the craft's unmanned capabilities ahead of time. It will also need to navigate criticism of its fueling procedures from NASA advisors, who worry about the safety of astronauts flying on SpaceX rockets.

And underlying all of this is SpaceX's hope to fly more rockets in 2017 than it has in any other year, with 18 launches expected. (Owner Elon Musk also has a similarly ambitious year lined up at his other company, Tesla.)

The company has stressed that it wants to increase its launches- to as often as every two weeks-in order to accommodate client needs. In 2016, SpaceX was nearly on that pace before the failed launch derailed its efforts. Besides doing all the work for its new programs, it will also need to keep the Falcon 9 flying routinely.

The company can't afford another prolonged setback that would create delays in its other projects. So, does that compare to your to-do list?"
2441252405,"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from California on Saturday, marking the company's first launch since a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad more than four months ago.

The two-stage rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:54 a.m. carrying a payload of 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc., which is replacing its entire global network with 70 next-generation satellites.

The satellites were expected to be deployed about an hour after launch.

About nine minutes after the rocket blasted off, to cheers from the control room, its jettisoned first stage landed upright on a so-called droneship in the Pacific Ocean south of Vandenberg - part of Spacex's effort to make boosters reusable.

The company has succeeded six times previously with landings on a barge or ashore.

A camera aboard the first stage gave viewers a you-are-there experience as it returned to Earth, flared landing rockets and made a perfect vertical touchdown on the floating pad.

The return to flight is an important step for SpaceX, billionaire Elon Musk's California-based company that has about 70 launches in line, worth more than $10 billion. In addition to commercial launches, SpaceX ferries supplies to the International Space Station and is developing a Falcon capable of carrying astronauts to the station.

SpaceX officials say they identified all possible causes of the Sept. 1 accident during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, and took corrective action.

The accident destroyed the rocket and its payload - a satellite that Facebook wanted to use to spread internet access in Africa - and grounded the Falcon 9 program as an investigation took place.

SpaceX announced this month that investigators concluded the accident involved a failure of one of three helium tanks inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen tank.

The investigation involved the Air Force, NASA, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, which issued a license for the launch.

The September accident was the second time a Falcon 9 was destroyed. In June 2015, a Falcon loaded with space station supplies disintegrated shortly after liftoff. SpaceX determined that a support strut broke.

The 10 satellites launched Saturday are part of McLean, Virginia-based Iridium's project to replace its existing network of satellites that provide global voice and data communications.

The program, called Iridium NEXT, was not only delayed by the SpaceX accident but again most recently as a powerful storm headed into California last weekend.

Iridium plans six more Falcon 9 launches, each carrying 10 satellites, as part of a technology upgrade expected to be completed in 2018.

SpaceX's effort to recover Falcon first stages is intended to reduce costs by recycling a major piece of the launch system.

The first stage contains tanks for liquid oxygen and kerosene as well as nine engines that power the rocket and payload into space, then separates 2½ minutes into flight as the single-engine second stage ignites and continues on to place payloads in the proper orbit.

The first Falcon booster to safely land back on Earth now stands outside the company's headquarters."

2441265066,"SpaceX successfully launched a rocket into orbit Saturday for the first time since a launchpad explosion last fall destroyed another rocket and its $200 million payload, just days before their scheduled flight.

The Falcon 9 rocket launched from an air force base in California's central coast, carrying 10 satellites for Virginia-based communications company Iridium. Its first stage then returned to Earth and landed on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean, a maneuver the spaceflight company has completed several times already.

The successful launch restores some momentum for Elon Musk's SpaceX. The company went into hibernation after its rocket and the Israeli communications satellite on board went up in flames during a fueling process. SpaceX, along with several federal aviation and transportation agencies, spent four months investigating the incident. It announced the results earlier this month, saying the explosion was caused by a failure of the rocket's helium tanks.

SpaceX needed this successful launch to reassure NASA, which is expecting the company to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station next year. Last week, a safety advisory group within the space agency called for scrutiny of SpaceX's rocket fueling process.

SpaceX previously lost a Falcon 9 rocket in June 2015, breaking a streak of successful launches for the company. The rocket exploded two minutes after takeoff, destroying the supplies it was supposed to carry to the International Space Station. ""I think to some degree, the company as a whole became maybe a little bit complacent after twenty successes in a row,"" Musk said back then. A Wall Street Journal report published last week shows just how much that incident set SpaceX back. The explosion, together with the resulting delays in future launches, led to a $260 million loss that year and a 6 percent drop in revenue, according to internal financial documents seen by the Journal.

Saturday's launch is the first of seven SpaceX is scheduled to conduct for Iridium. It kicks off a potentially big year for the SpaceX. In addition to a dozen planned launches in 2017, Musk wants to test the Falcon Heavy, a rocket that can carry larger payloads to deep-space destinations like Mars, and the Crew Dragon spaceship that will eventually carry NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.

2441274009,"SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket today from California - over four months after one of the company's vehicles exploded on a launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida . The rocket took off just before 1PM ET from Vandenberg Air Force Base, putting 10 satellites into orbit for communications company Iridium. After the initial takeoff, SpaceX was also able to land the Falcon 9 on a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean . It was the first successful launch of the Falcon 9 since August, as the company was forced to ground all of its vehicles following the September explosion.

Today's launch marks an incredibly short turnaround for a rocket company following an accident. It took SpaceX six months to recover from its previous rocket failure in June 2015, when one of the company's Falcon 9s disintegrated en route to the International Space Station. Other companies have taken years to recover from the loss of a vehicle. Orbital ATK, for instance, spent two years updating the engines on its Antares rocket after a previous version of the vehicle exploded during take off in 2014. ""It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is,"" Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters .

SpaceX struggled to understand what caused the launchpad failure in September, with Elon Musk calling the accident ""the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years."" The explosion occurred as the Falcon 9 was being loaded with propellant in preparation for a static fire test - a routine procedure SpaceX does to test the rocket's engines before flight. During propellant loading, the rocket ignited in a fireball that lead to the vehicle's destruction and the loss of the Amos 6 satellite it was supposed to carry into space a few days later.

SpaceX grounded all of its rockets and spent its hiatus from spaceflight investigating the accident with help from NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US Air Force, and the National Transportation Safety Board. Two weeks ago, the company came to the conclusion that the problem started in the Falcon 9's upper liquid oxygen tank , which stores super chilled liquid oxygen propellant. That oxygen seems to have had a bad reaction with vessels housed inside the tank known as composite overwrapped pressure vessels, or COPVs.

These vessels, which house helium needed to pressurize the tank, consist of an inner aluminum liner surrounded by carbon fibers. SpaceX was able to find some debris of the COPVs after the accident and found that the aluminum liner had buckled, or was scrunched up. The idea is that some of the liquid oxygen from the propellant tank got between the carbon fibers and the aluminum, where it pooled into the recesses of these buckles. Meanwhile, the helium from the COPV was so cold that it may have caused this pooled oxygen to turn into a solid, making it extra vulnerable to ignition. Friction from the carbon overwrap, or even breaking carbon fibers, may have provided the spark needed to create the fireball.

The FAA accepted SpaceX's explanation for the accident, granting the company a launch license last week for today's mission. And the mission's success signals that SpaceX is ready to get back to launching its rockets again. That's important given the company's busy year ahead. SpaceX planned to launch 20 rockets last year, and 27 this year, according to financial documents released to the Wall Street Journal . The September explosion meant the company only launched eight rockets in 2016, so there's definitely a backlog of customers waiting to fly this year.

Today's launch was the first part of the Iridium NEXT mission, an effort by Iridium to create a large constellation of 66 satellites in lower Earth orbit. The company also plans to have 15 spare satellites - six in orbit and nine on the ground. Altogether, these satellites will deliver mobile voice and data coverage all over the planet, including over the ocean and at the poles, according to Iridium. SpaceX has a contract with Iridium to launch 70 of these satellites over seven launches over this year and next."

SpaceX is preparing to launch a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time since a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad more than four months ago.
The two-stage rocket is scheduled to lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on Saturday morning to place 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc.

SpaceX officials believe they have identified all possible causes of the Sept. 1 accident and taken corrective action.

The return to flight is an important step for SpaceX, a California-based company that has about 70 launches in line, worth more than $10 billion.

SpaceX also intends to try to land the rocket's first stage on a barge in the Pacific Ocean south of Vandenberg about eight minutes after liftoff. It has had six previous successful landings."
2441283974,"SpaceX on Saturday successfully launched and landed its first unmanned Falcon 9 rocket since a costly and complicated launchpad explosion in September.

""Liftoff of the Falcon 9,"" a SpaceX commentator said as the tall white rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:54 am (1754 GMT), carrying a payload of 10 satellites for Iridium, a mobile and data communications company.

Moments after the Falcon 9 soared into the sky, the rocket's two sections separated as planned, sending the satellites to orbit and the tall portion, known as the first stage, of the rocket back to Earth.

Cheers erupted at SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne, California as live video images showed the first stage powering its engines and landing steady and upright on a platform marked with an X in the Pacific Ocean.

SpaceX has successfully landed multiple rockets this way, on both land and water, as part of its effort to bring down the cost of space flight by re-using multimillion dollar components instead of jettisoning them in the ocean after launch.

The platform, or droneship, was labeled ""Just Read the Instructions.""

Though the landings garner plenty of excitement, SpaceX's primary mission was to safely deliver the payload of satellites to orbit.

""Mission looks good,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter.

""All satellites deployed.""

Saturday's launch was the first in a series planned to upgrade Iridium's global communications network.

The $3 billion project aims to send 81 satellites to space in the coming months.

- High stakes -

The stakes for SpaceX were high after a pair of accidents.

September's blast destroyed a $200 million satellite Facebook had planned to use to beam high-speed internet to Africa. Another explosion in June 2015 two minutes after liftoff obliterated a Dragon cargo ship packed with goods bound for the astronauts at the International Space Station.

The incidents cost SpaceX dearly, possibly pushing the privately owned company into the red, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.

""That June 2015 disaster, followed by months of launch delays, contributed to a quarter-billion dollar annual loss and a six percent drop in revenue, after two years of surging sales and small profits,"" the paper said after a review of internal financial documents from 2011 to 2015, forecasts for the next decade and interviews with former SpaceX employees.

Three weeks after last September's accident, the company removed a long-standing phrase from its website saying it was ""profitable and cash-flow positive.""

That ""suggest(ed) both profit and cash flow had moved into the red for 2016,"" the Journal said, noting that it found an operating loss for every quarter in 2015 and negative cash flow of roughly $15 million.

SpaceX, headed by Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur who also runs Tesla Motors, declined to comment on the findings and is not obligated to release its financial figures because it is a private company.

""The company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth,"" with $1 billion in cash and no debt, SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnson was quoted as saying.

- Fueling concerns -

The June 2015 accident -- in which the unmanned Dragon cargo ship exploded in a massive fireball two minutes after launch -- was caused by a faulty strut that allowed a helium tank to snap loose, SpaceX said.

Last September's explosion, during a test a day prior to a scheduled launch, was traced to a problem with a pressure vessel in the second-stage liquid oxygen tank.

SpaceX said it will change the way it fuels for now and redesign its pressure vessels in the future.

But a report out this week by a top NASA advisory group also expressed concerns about the way SpaceX fuels its rockets, particularly since it plans to start launching astronauts to space in the coming years.

SpaceX uses super chilled liquid oxygen, and since the temperature must stay so low, it plans to have astronauts inside the spacecraft atop the rocket before fueling is complete, known as a ""load and go"" approach.

The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel urged NASA to scrutinize this process closely, saying its risks may not be ""adequately understood.""

Musk has lofty goals, including colonizing Mars and revolutionizing the launch industry by making rocket components reusable.

Founded in 2002, SpaceX logged 18 successful launches of the Falcon 9 before the 2015 accident.

The company has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to supply the International Space Station using its Dragon space capsule, which is the only cargo ship that can return to the Earth intact."
2441299012,SpaceX just launched and landed its first Falcon 9 rocket of the year. Watch the incredible landing footage as the first stage of the rocket flies to a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean - it's nothing short of amazing.
2441316225,"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted 10 next-generation Iridium telephone satellites into orbit Saturday, a successful return to fight that should help restore confidence in the low-cost booster after a devastating launch pad explosion last September.

That dramatic conflagration likely was caused by super-cold oxygen in the booster's second stage that worked its way beneath the carbon fiber outer skin of a high pressure helium tank, triggering the tank's rupture and the near-instant destruction of the rocket and its $200 million satellite payload.

For Saturday's flight, SpaceX engineers changed a variety of pre-launch procedures, loading RP-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen earlier in the countdown than before to slightly raise temperatures around the helium tanks. The technique was used for an engine test firing earlier this month and went off without a hitch Saturday. After brief concern about winds and a boat in the offshore danger zone, the slender 229-foot-tall rocket's nine first stage engines thundered to life at 9:54 a.m. PST (GMT-8), throttled up to full power and majestically pushed the booster away from its seaside launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles.

Trailing a brilliant tongue of fiery exhaust, the Falcon 9 quickly arced away on a southerly trajectory as it climbed out of the dense lower atmosphere, its Merlin 1D engines generating a combined 1.5 million pounds of thrust.

The first stage engines shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after launch. The stage then fell away and the single engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage took over, its nozzle glowing bright red against the limb of the Earth, generating 210,000 pounds of thrust to continue the climb to space.

The first stage, meanwhile, flipped around and restarted three of its engines to reduce forward velocity and begin a descent to a SpaceX droneship stationed several hundred miles south of Vandenberg. Recovering stages for eventual refurbishment and reuse is a major element in company founder Elon Musk's ongoing drive to reduce launch costs.

After a second engine firing to slow the booster still more for atmospheric entry, the stage plummeted tail first toward the Pacific Ocean, restarted a single engine, deployed four landing legs and settled to a picture-perfect touchdown on the droneship Just Read the Instructions.

The first stage of the Falcon 9 completed a successful descent to a SpaceX droneship stationed south of the launch site. It was SpaceX's seventh successful landing in 12 attempts.

SpaceX webcast

It was the company's seventh successful landing in 12 attempts, its fifth on a droneship and the first for a Falcon 9 launched from Vandenberg.

But as with all Falcon 9 flights, the landing was a strictly secondary objective. The primary goal was to boost the 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations into orbit and the Falcon 9 did just that.

The second stage completed the first of two burns just over nine minutes after liftoff. A short three-second burn was executed 43 minutes later to complete the climb to an initial 488-mile-high orbit tilted 86.4 degrees to the equator.

Seven minutes after that, the 10 Iridium NEXT satellites were released in sequence from a dispenser mounted atop the second stage, the first batch in a planned 72-satellite network that will replace the company's current fleet of aging low-Earth-orbit mobile voice and data relay stations.

The complex satellite-by-satellite swap-out will allow Iridium to retire first-generation relay stations that have operated long past their design life, replacing them with upgraded, more powerful spacecraft and expanding the company's capabilities in an increasingly competitive commercial space operations environment.

""Frankly, it means our future, because we have to replace this network anyway,"" Iridium CEO Matthew Desch said in an interview with CBS News last year. ""I often think of it as one of the biggest tech refreshes in the world right now, with a new $3 billion constellation.""

Altogether, Iridium is paying SpaceX upwards of $500 million for seven Falcon 9 launches to boost 70 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit, 10 at a time, over the next year or so. Two more will be launched aboard a different rocket.

""The new satellites are a lot more powerful, a lot more processing power, they've got a lot more memory, a lot more capacity, they actually expand our ability to support customers,"" Desch said. And, he added, ""they're easier to operate.""

Engineers will spend three months testing each new satellite and carrying out a satellite-by-satellite swap-out, moving a new spacecraft into position near the vehicle it's replacing and switching service from one to the other.

The Iridium network requires 66 satellites to provide global coverage, but the company plans to launch 15 in-orbit spares to provide immediate backup in case of an in-orbit malfunction and to serve as an insurance policy of sorts in the event of a launch failure.

An Iridium NEXT satellite. Iridium As important as the Falcon 9 launching was to Iridium, it was even more important for SpaceX after an in-flight failure in June 2015 and the dramatic on-pad explosion Sept. 1 at Cape Canaveral.

The Falcon 9's record of two failures in 29 rockets stands in contrast to the record of its major U.S. competitor, United Launch Alliance, which has launched 102 more expensive Atlas 5s and Delta 4s without a single failure. The European consortium Arianespace has successfully launched more than 75 Ariane 5s in a row.

But SpaceX enjoys widespread support in the satellite industry, in large part because of the Falcon 9's innovative design and relatively low cost. With a list price of $60 million per booster, a Falcon 9 is roughly half the cost of rockets offered by its major competitors.

But lower costs cannot offset significantly higher risk, and industry analysts say SpaceX needs a string of successful flights to maintain its long-range goal of capturing a major of the commercial launch market.

With a successful return to flight Saturday, SpaceX will now focus on working off a backlog of delayed payloads, launching a commercial communications satellite from Cape Canaveral later this month and a space station resupply mission in February. The first flight of a ""used"" Falcon 9 first stage is expected in the next few months.

Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and CEO, said the company currently has about 70 flights on its manifest, a backlog valued at some $10 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that SpaceX lost $260 million in the wake of the 2015 in-flight failure, launching just six missions that year instead of 12 that were originally planned.

It's not known what impact the September failure might have on the company's bottom line or how delays will ripple through its manifest. SpaceX launched eight flights in 2016 and was forced to delay at least seven more.

But Shotwell is optimistic, saying earlier this week that no customers have abandoned SpaceX. Bret Johnsen, SpaceX chief financial officer, said in a statement the company continues to enjoy ""strong customer relationships.""

""Furthermore,"" he said, ""with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.""

The Falcon 9 took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and landed on a ""droneship"" in the Pacific Ocean.

Approximately an hour after the rocket had been launched, it deployed satellites.

NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force and the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the September explosion, which was due to the failure of a helium tank.

Launch of the Upgraded Falcon 9 took place during an ""instantaneous"" window at 9:54 a.m. PST Saturday, 14 January, and marked its third flight from Space Launch Complex (SLC)-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Within eight minutes, the first stage completed a smooth touchdown on the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS), nicknamed ""Just Read the Instructions"", which was situated off the coast of San Diego. This marked the first time that the ""West Coast"" drone ship had hosted a fully successful landing of a Falcon 9 first stage. Aside from the visible triumph of returning to flight and bagging another ASDS landing, however, SpaceX has successfully fulfilled the first part of a seven-year-old contract which will see it place 70 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit by spring 2018.

""Team Vandenberg takes pride in supporting the launch of Iridium NEXT and SpaceX's return to flight,"" said Col. J. Christopher Moss, 30th Space Wing Commander at Vandenberg and the Launch Decision Authority for the Iridium NEXT mission. ""Today's launch is a testament to the professionalism and commitment to mission assurance, public safety, and mission success on the Western Range.""


A mere 13 months ago, on 21 December 2015, SpaceX returned to nominal flight operations, following the high-altitude loss of a Dragon cargo mission the previous June. A bright 2016 got underway, as SpaceX retired its Falcon 9 v1.1 booster and focused on the Upgraded Falcon 9, which benefits from an enhanced fueling regime and has been able to accomplish the first-ever landing of first-stage hardware on solid ground. Between 17 January and 14 August last year, no fewer than eight Upgraded Falcon 9s-the largest number ever flown by SpaceX within a single calendar year-roared smoothly aloft, delivering six commercial communications satellites to Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO), the Jason-3 ocean altimetry spacecraft into low-Earth orbit and a pair of Dragon cargo ships toward the International Space Station (ISS).

Then, on 1 September, just two days before the ninth Upgraded Falcon 9 of 2016 would have launched the Amos-6 communications satellite to GTO, disaster struck. During routine pre-launch operations on Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., the vehicle and payload were destroyed in an explosion. As outlined by AmericaSpace's Mike Killian in a recent article, investigators zeroed-in on a breach in the cryogenic helium system of the liquid oxygen tank aboard the Upgraded Falcon 9's second stage. Attention was focused specifically on one of three Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) inside the tank itself and SpaceX provisionally announced plans to return to flight in mid-December, launching the first ten satellites of a contracted 70-strong booking with the Iridium global mobile telecommunications provider.

However, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) closure of the investigation-and permission to proceed with the launch-still pending, the flight found itself moved into early January. An initial target of the 8th was called off, reportedly due to high winds and rain at Vandenberg Air Force Base, together with ""other range conflicts"", and a new No Earlier Than (NET) date of the 14th seemed likely. An uncertain week followed, with both SpaceX and Iridium tweeting confidently about this date, but no formal confirmation from Vandenberg that Western Range approval had been secured. Not until Friday afternoon, with the closure of the final FAA pre-flight conditions, did Vandenberg's 30th Space Wing declare its readiness to support Saturday morning's opening launch attempt.

By this stage, the 230-foot-tall (70-meter) Upgraded Falcon 9 had stood on Space Launch Complex (SLC)-4E at Vandenberg for more than a week, having smoothly wrapped up a customary Static Fire Test of its nine Merlin 1D+ first-stage engines. New rules implemented after the Amos-6 accident required the customer's payload to be installed atop the booster after the Static Fire Test. As such, the ten Iridium NEXT satellites-housed in a special dispenser and encapsulated within a bulbous payload fairing-were loaded last weekend. On Friday, Iridium CEO Matt Desch tweeted an image of his company's ""ride to orbit"", standing proudly on SLC-4E.

Although today's mission was the 29th launch of a Falcon 9, it was actually the ninth mission by the Upgraded version of the vehicle, which benefits from an enhanced suite of Merlin 1D+ engines on its first and second stages. First flown in December 2015, it can transport up to 50,300 pounds (22,800 kg) into low-Earth orbit and up to 18,300 pounds (8,300 kg) to GTO, which represents an approximately 72-percent performance hike over the capabilities of its predecessor, the Falcon 9 v1.1, which completed 15 missions between September 2013 and January 2016. And prior to that were five flights by the first-generation Falcon 9 v1.0 from June 2010 through March 2013. Unlike its v1.0 and v1.1 cousins, the Upgraded Falcon 9 benefits from the use of ""densified"" cryogenic propellants, which are chilled much closer to their freezing point and loaded much later in the countdown, normally from around T-35 minutes. This densification process also affords the vehicle a greater performance flexibility.

Due to the requirements of the Iridium NEXT payload, the launch window is an ""instantaneous"" one, with very limited margin to accommodate last-minute technical issues or changeable weather conditions. Saturday's opening attempt was carefully timed for 9:54 a.m. PST, with a 60-percent likelihood of acceptable weather conditions at T-0. That forecast was expected to deteriorate to only 40-percent-favorable in the event of a scrub and 24-hour turnaround to a Sunday launch attempt.

Early Saturday, the fueling of the Upgraded Falcon 9 got underway in a slightly different manner to previous flights, in light of findings from the Amos-6 investigation. ""The fueling now occurs somewhat earlier in the countdown,"" noted AmericaSpace's Launch Tracker, ""eliminating the rush in the last 30 minutes to get the rocket fueled and prepared for launch."" Instead of kicking off fueling at T-35 minutes, the loading of a highly-refined form of rocket-grade kerosene (known as ""RP-1"") actually got underway at 8:50 a.m., more than an hour before launch. This was followed by the onset of liquid oxygen tanking at 9:15 a.m.

Backdropped by near-perfect weather conditions, with clear skies and calm winds, the only issues of note occurred in the final 15 minutes, when Range Safety reported that ship had strayed into the launch exclusion area. This was quickly shooed away and at 9:44 a.m. the terminal countdown autosequencer got underway at T-10 minutes. The nine Merlin 1D+ engines of the first stage-arranged in a circle of eight, with the ninth at the center-were chilled-down, ahead of ignition, and the SLC-4E strongback was retracted and the Flight Termination System (FTS) was armed. In the final minutes, the Upgraded Falcon 9 transitioned to internal power, and the Iridium NEXT payload was powered up, ahead of the vehicle assuming primary control of all critical functions at T-60 seconds.

Also at the one-minute mark in the countdown, the 53 nozzles of the Niagara deluge system flooded the SLC-4E launch pad with 30,000 gallons (113,500 liters) of water, per minute, to suppress the acoustic energy. Three seconds before liftoff, the nine Merlins roared to life, pumping out a combined thrust of 1.5 million pounds (680,000 kg). Liftoff occurred precisely on time at 9:54 a.m. PST.

Climbing smoothly into the crystalline Californian sky, the booster performed with its usual perfection, passing the point of maximum aerodynamic turbulence (colloquially dubbed ""Max Q"") at 70 seconds into the ascent. A little more than two minutes after launch, the first stage shut down and separated from the rapidly climbing vehicle, whose second stage-powered by a single, restartable Merlin 1D+ Vacuum engine, with a thrust of 210,000 pounds (92,250 kg)-picked up the baton to deliver the ten Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit.

The first stage, of course, had another mission: to land smoothly on the deck of the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) in the Pacific Ocean. Although first-stage landings on drone ships have been attempted over the past two years, firstly in January 2015, it was not until April 2016 that an Upgraded Falcon 9 made a fully successful touchdown, in one piece, without toppling over. During the summer of 2016, three more first stages followed suit in similarly spectacular style, but all did so on the East Coast-based drone ship, nicknamed ""Of Course I Still Love You"".

Meanwhile, SpaceX's West Coast launch site at Vandenberg had only been used twice before this morning's launch. It hosted the maiden voyage of the Falcon 9 v1.1 in September 2013 and, more recently, saw the Jason-3 ocean altimetry mission launch in January of last year. On its last flight, the West Coast-based drone ship, dubbed ""Just Read the Instructions"", was positioned about 173 miles (278 km) south of Vandenberg, off San Diego, to receive the descending first stage. Although the stage reached the deck of the drone ship, one of its landing legs failed to properly latch into place and it toppled over and exploded.

Today's mission, it was hoped, would see the very first successful first-stage landing for Just Read the Instructions. And that landing was truly spectacular. In contrast to several previous missions, which have been plagued by intermittent video communications, the entire descent from the edge of Earth's sensible atmosphere to the deck of the ASDS was captured. The first stage was jettisoned from the remainder of the Upgraded Falcon 9 at 9:56 a.m. PST, some two minutes and 27 seconds after liftoff, and proceeded to deploy its four lattice-like grid fins. Configured in an X-wing layout, these served to control the lift vector, as the first-stage executed a trio of engine ""burns"" to flip itself over, adjust its rate of descent and finally-around eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch-bring itself to a smooth touchdown on the deck of Just Read the Instructions.

As the first stage stood proudly atop the drone ship, awaiting retrieval, the second stage continued its primary mission to deliver the Iridium NEXT satellites to their desired orbital slot. The first engine firing lasted 6.5 minutes, punctuated by the jettison of the payload fairing, and shutdown occurred at 10:03 a.m. The stack then coasted for around three-quarters of an hour, before the Merlin 1D+ Vacuum roared to life a second time at 10:46 a.m. This time, it burned for just three seconds, positioning its precious payloads for deployment. About an hour after launch, the first five Iridiums departed their dispenser, followed by the remainder about 15 minutes later. ""Mission looks good,"" tweeted SpaceX CEO Elon Musk at 11:05 a.m. ""Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the drone ship.""

However, ground station telemetry coverage prevented early confirmation that the Iridiums had been deployed. With some relief, confirmation came relatively quickly. ""The last the Iridium NEXT satellites has just been released and all ten are now flying under their own power,"" AmericaSpace's Launch Tracker noted. ""This completes the launch mission for SpaceX and commences the start of the operational checkout and integration for Iridium."" Current plans are for SpaceX to deliver the remaining 60 satellites to orbit, over six launches, by spring 2018, thereby fulfilling a $462 million contract with Iridium Corp., which was signed back in June 2010."
2441341652,"SpaceX's successful launch of 10 satellites for Iridium Communications marks the beginning of one of the biggest ""tech refreshes"" in history, Iridium said on Saturday, as it hailed the company's first lift-off since an explosion last fall. 
The SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off from California earlier in the day, delivering the satellites into low-Earth orbit about an hour later.

""Today Iridium launches a new era in the history of our company and a new era in space as we start to deliver the next-generation of satellite communications,"" Iridium CEO Matt Desch said in a statement on Saturday.

Over the next 18 months, Iridium plans several more launches in what it called ""the beginning of one of the biggest 'tech refreshes' in history"" and ""a new era"" of space travel, as it aims to replace a host of satellites orbiting the globe.

The company has a seven-flight contract with SpaceX worth $468.1 million and plans to deploy 10 satellites at time. 

SpaceX's launch on Saturday was the first since a September explosion during fueling ahead of a pre-flight test in Florida. The explosion destroyed a $62 million SpaceX booster and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to put into orbit two days later."
2441345638,@elonmusk awesome 😎? & congrats! #SpaceX #spacedomination
2441350382,"On Saturday, SpaceX triumphantly returned to flight after an accident last September. The company launched 10 Iridium satellites into an orbit 625km above the Earth's surface, and, as a bonus, SpaceX also demonstrated its increasing mastery of rocket landings by bringing the first stage booster back to a drone ship off the California coast. SpaceX has now successfully landed seven rockets back on Earth.

This flight was essential for SpaceX because the Falcon 9 rocket is at the core of every aspect of SpaceX's business. Mission success means that the company can now move forward with its lofty ambitions for the year 2017, which include a long list of tasks to ensure a bright future for the rocket company in Hawthorne, California. Here's a look at the company's to-do list:

Increase cadence

SpaceX makes money when it launches rockets and loses money when it doesn't. A recent report on the company's finances showed a $250 million loss in operating income in 2015 after a rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station exploded. SpaceX almost certainly lost money in 2016 when another rocket exploded on the launch pad. It needs to fly more in 2017, and it needs to fly safely.

Internal documents reveal that SpaceX hopes to fly as many as 27 missions this year, and founder Elon Musk has set a target of approximately 50 launches a year by the end of this decade. For 2017, a more realistic ""high end"" goal is probably about 20 flights. That would, nevertheless, represent a significant step up for the company, which has only successfully flown the Falcon 9 rocket 27 times since its maiden flight in 2010. To meet a target of 20 flight this year, SpaceX would need to fly about every 2.5 weeks in 2017.

The company's next launch will likely occur from Florida's Kennedy Space Center and would carry the EchoStar 23 satellite payload from Launch Complex 39A. The no-earlier-than date for this launch is presently January 26. If the company flies the EchoStar mission by early February, then 20 launches this year doesn't seem unreasonable.

Reuse

With seven first-stage booster landings at sea and on land, SpaceX has now shown that it can bring rockets home. The big question remains whether it has the capacity to refurbish those rockets on a timely and cost-effective basis before flying them again.

The next step toward this goal is re-flying a used booster. During an interview this week with CBS News, the company's chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, said SpaceX plans to do that for the first time in ""a month or so"" with the launch of the SES-10 communications satellite.

As for full reusability, in which a rocket lands, is refurbished, and flies again shortly thereafter, Shotwell said SpaceX remains ""a couple of years away from that."" However, the company is clearly planning to collect a lot of first stage boosters. SpaceX is nearing permission to expand from 1 to 3 landing pads in Florida to accommodate the return of three boosters from the Falcon Heavy rocket-at once.

Heavy lift

Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, the United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy has reigned as the most powerful rocket in the world, with a capacity of sending about 29 tons to low Earth orbit. SpaceX is seeking to enter the heavy-lift launch market with its Falcon Heavy rocket, which has an estimated capacity of about 54 tons.

Consisting of three Falcon 9 cores, the Falcon Heavy would essentially double the lift capability of any rocket in existence today. Its cost-nominally $90 million but likely a multiple of that-is a significant selling point. A proven Falcon Heavy rocket, for example, might force Congress to ask why NASA is developing the Space Launch System, with a 70-ton capacity and an operational cost of $2 billion or more per flight.

Although the Falcon Heavy has been delayed for several years, it may finally reach space in 2017. We've heard reports of rocket tests at its McGregor facility in Texas and the completion of Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, where the Falcon Heavy will take flight. Various company sources have pegged target launch dates of late spring and early summer for the maiden Falcon Heavy launch.

If-and this remains a big if-the Falcon Heavy flies this year, it would send an emphatic statement that not only has SpaceX moved beyond its Falcon 9 accidents, but that it has stepped into the future with a heavy-lift launch rocket. That would be territory where only superpower governments have trod before.

Commercial crew

During the last five years, as it has continued to fine-tune its Falcon 9 rocket and built up its commercial launch business, SpaceX has derived the majority of its revenue from NASA. The agency has paid SpaceX to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and develop a crew version of the Dragon spacecraft to transport humans there.

NASA has contracted with both SpaceX and Boeing as part of its commercial crew program. Before beginning operational missions to the station, each company is required by NASA to fly an uncrewed ""demonstration"" mission and a 14-day crewed test flight. The latest ""no-earlier-than"" dates for the crewed test flights are May 2018 for SpaceX and August 2018 for Boeing. Such launches would allow one or both companies to begin operational flights before the end of 2018, which NASA is counting on.

As part of SpaceX's timeline to meet this schedule, the company has said it will fly the uncrewed demonstration mission in November 2017. Thus, for its biggest and most important customer, SpaceX must continue to make enough progress with its crewed Dragon spacecraft to put it into space this year.

Mars and Satellite internet

Much has been made of SpaceX's plans to develop global satellite Internet and then use the profits of that endeavor as a basis to fund an ambitious plan to begin colonizing Mars within 10 or 15 years. The reality is that none of this can happen unless the Falcon 9 rocket has a successful 2017.

A reliable Falcon 9 makes SpaceX profitable, and a reusable Falcon 9 dramatically cuts the cost of spaceflight. The Falcon 9 also enables the Falcon Heavy rocket, and it will be used to power the crew Dragon into orbit. In the near term, the company must demonstrate these capabilities after two accidents with the Falcon 9 rocket in two years.

Once this happens, then the company's grand plans can begin to fall into place. A reusable, low-cost Falcon 9 rocket is essential to putting all those global internet satellites into space. And only then, after conquering the Earth orbit launch market, might we finally begin to consider the plausibility of plans to colonize Mars with bigger rockets and much larger spacecraft."
2441368010,"VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from here Jan. 14 at 12:54 p.m. Eastern and successfully delivered ten Iridium Communications satellites into polar orbit one hour and 14 minutes later, while the Falcon 9's first stage successfully landed on a ship off the California coast.

It was the first SpaceX flight since a Falcon 9 exploded Sept. 1 on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, destroying the Amos-6 communications satellite. SpaceX blamed the failure on a helium tank in the rocket's second stage that ruptured during fueling for a static-fire test, and the company said earlier this month it would adjust the rocket's fueling process.

The launch marks an important milestone for Iridium, a company eager to begin replacing its 66 global communications satellites with its next-generation constellation. The oldest satellites in Iridium's existing 66-satellite constellation were launched in 1998.

Despite their advanced age, customers around the world have a 98 percent chance of getting a signal, Matt Desch, Iridium Communications chief executive, said prior to the launch. Nevertheless, Iridium is eager to begin replacing each of its satellites with a new model designed to offer customers more bandwidth and higher data speeds.

With its first two launches, Iridium plans to plug holes in its existing constellation, where aging satellites are no longer functioning. The Jan. 14 launch was aimed at one of those orbital planes. The next launch, scheduled to fly from Vandenberg in April, will fill the second hole, Desch said.

Iridium purchased seven Falcon 9 launches from SpaceX at a total cost of between $450 million and $500 million, Desch said. SpaceX plans to fly ten satellites on each of those missions. The next launch is scheduled for April with subsequent launches occurring every two months. Iridium hopes to have its new constellation in place in early 2018.

SpaceX and Iridium officials attending the launch were extremely pleased the Falcon 9 launch occurred on schedule after multiple delays in recent weeks. Because the ten Iridium satellites needed to reach a specific orbital plane, the launch window was instantaneous. Any delay in the scheduled launch would have meant another 24-hour delay, Desch said.

Approximately eight minutes after launch, SpaceX landed its first stage on the company's drone ship in the Pacific Ocean called Just Read the Instructions. It was the seventh time SpaceX was able to land its first stage on an uncrewed ship. The Jan. 14 launch was SpaceX's 28th successful launch.

Iridium declined to comment on reports that the company has purchased an eighth flight from SpaceX. SpaceX briefing materials may be offering a hint of more than the seven announced flights, however, because they say the Jan. 14 flight was ""the first of at least 70 satellites that SpaceX will be launching for Iridium's next generation"" constellation.

SpaceX spokesman John Taylor declined to say when Falcon 9 would fly again, saying the company generally leaves those announcements to its customers."
2441371411,"SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket climbed into orbit from California's Central Coast on Saturday, resuming service after an explosive setback last year and delivering much-needed reinforcements to Iridium's satellite constellation providing communications by land, sea and sky.

The comeback mission kicks off a busy launch manifest with more than 20 SpaceX rocket flights expected this year as the company prepares to start launching astronauts, vital national security payloads and a slate of valuable telecommunications satellites for global broadcasters and network clients.

The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) launcher fired away from Vandenberg Air Force Base, a military complex northwest Los Angeles, at 9:54:39 a.m. PST (12:54:39 p.m. EST; 1754:39 GMT) and soared into a brilliant blue sky, trailing a stream of orange-hot exhaust from nine kerosene-fueled Merlin 1D engines as the booster turned south over the Pacific Ocean.

Two-and-a-half minutes later, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket detached and flew back to the ground, steering through the rarefied upper atmosphere with aerodynamic grid fins and periodic bursts of rocket thrust, nailing a vertical propulsive landing on a barge - or ""drone ship"" - loitering in the Pacific Ocean west of Baja California.

The recovery attempts were billed as experiments when SpaceX first tried them, but Saturday's touchdown marked the seventh time one of the 15-story first stage boosters has landed intact. SpaceX intends to refurbish and refly the salvaged rockets, beginning as soon as late February with the launch of a communications craft for SES.

Meanwhile, the mission's primary purpose was the deployment of 10 new-generation voice and data relay spacecraft for Iridium, a provider of global satellite phone, aircraft and ship tracking, and messaging services.

The second stage's single Merlin engine shut off around nine minutes after blastoff, and the rocket coasted halfway around the planet, passing over Antarctica before reigniting the engine at around T+plus 52 minutes.

The brief three-second maneuver put the rocket into an on-target orbit, SpaceX said. The mission was aiming for a near-circular 388-mile-high (625-kilometer) perch in polar orbit.

Then came a sequence of 10 critical satellite deployments to release each of the 1,896-pound (860-kilogram) ""Iridium Next"" spacecraft.

A ground station problem prevented launch control from monitoring the separation maneuvers in real-time, a SpaceX official said, but a few minutes later the rocket flew in range of a tracking site in Svalbard, Norway, transmitting telemetry confirming all 10 satellites were away.

""It's a clean sweep, 10 for 10,"" said John Insprucker, SpaceX's Falcon 9 product manager. ""All the bridge wires show open, and that is a conclusion of the primary mission today, a great one (for the) first stage, second stage, and the customer's satellites deployed into a good orbit.""

Engineers from Iridium and Thales Alenia Space, the satellites' prime contractor, verified all 10 relay stations were alive and functioning after their ride to orbit.

That was the moment Iridium chief executive Matt Desch said he would breathe a sigh of relief.

""The real nerves for me is that this is the first time we have deployed our satellites and had them talk to us,"" Desch told Spaceflight Now in an interview before the launch. ""I know that fear will go down dramatically once we get some satellites in orbit.""

Saturday's flight was the first of at least seven Falcon 9 flights planned to populate the Iridium fleet with modernized satellites.

The successful launch clears the way for the resumption of SpaceX missions after a rocket exploded on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral on Sept. 1, grounding the Falcon 9 four-and-a-half months.

SpaceX traced the probable cause of the accident to high-pressure helium tanks on the Falcon 9's upper stage, which are immersed inside super-cold liquid oxygen and wrapped in carbon shell.

Engineers found that voids could form between the aluminum lining of the tanks, which hold cryogenic helium to pressurize the rocket's propellant system for flight, and the carbon overwrap.

Liquid oxygen trapped in the buckles can ignite, investigators said, and most likely led to the sudden explosion Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and a nearly $200 million satellite during a pre-flight test.

SpaceX said they would alter their countdown procedures on future launches, and no longer conduct such ""static fire"" tests with satellites on-board.

The launch company is shifting its Florida flights to launch pad 39A, a shuttle-era facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, after the Sept. 1 mishap damaged the Falcon 9's previous pad.

Construction crews are still finishing modifications to pad 39A for Falcon 9 flights and eventual crewed launches, which are planned in partnership with NASA starting in 2018 to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.

The next Falcon 9 mission could take off as soon as Jan. 26 from pad 39A with the EchoStar 23 communications satellite. SpaceX's next cargo delivery flight to the space station will follow around Feb. 8.

The 10 ""Iridium Next"" satellites orbited Saturday were designed by Thales Alenia Space in France, and then assembled and tested in an assembly line fashion in partnership with Orbital ATK in Arizona.

Sixty-six are needed to fully replace Iridium's current constellation, and Iridium ordered 15 more as spares.

""Leading a worldwide team to manufacture, assemble, test and prepare each satellite for this moment has been incredibly exciting,"" said Bertrand Maureau, executive vice president of telecommunications at Thales Alenia Space. ""We are very proud to have conducted such a unique program, in terms of scale and complexity as well as to have successfully completed the end-to-end whole constellation on-ground validation. The system is fully tested, and the compatibility of Iridium Next with the Block-1 operating satellites has been perfectly demonstrated.""

""We are proud to be a part of this revolutionary satellite program,"" said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital ATK's space systems group. ""Seeing these first ten satellites launch successfully into space is the result of a unique assembly line process at our satellite manufacturing facility that represents a remarkable achievement. We look forward to seeing the innovative solutions these satellites, which are great examples of leading-edge technology and manufacturability, will enable.""

The upgraded network will offer faster broadband connections, improved functionality and 3G-equivalent cellular phone services for Iridium's pool of nearly 850,000 subscribers, a client list that includes the U.S. military, oil and gas companies, aviation and maritime operators, and mining and construction contractors.

The upgraded satellites also carry piggyback payloads for Aireon, an affiliate of Iridium, to help air traffic controllers track airplane movements worldwide. Iridium Next satellites slated to fly on later launches will host an antenna to monitor maritime traffic for exactEarth, a Canadian company, and Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Florida.

Iridium and its contractors will spend around three months wringing out the first set of 10 Iridium Next spacecraft ahead of the launch of the next batch in April, according to Desch.

As more new satellites join the Iridium fleet, engineers will maneuver each one from its 388-mile-high drop-off orbit into the operational constellation at an altitude of 485 miles (780 kilometers) alongside the craft it is intended to replace.

""One-by-one, we'll do this process called a slot swap, where we move the satellite 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the other satellite - right behind it - and then instantaneously swap over the inter-satellite links between the old satellite and its peers and the new satellite and its peers,"" Desch said. ""Then we will command the old satellite to deboost and deorbit itself.""

Desch said Iridium's team used the launch delays for extra testing on the satellites, the ground control system and software to ensure the ""slot swaps"" go as planned. The ground team has also rehearsed the activity in simulations.

""That whole process is going to go one-by-one 66 times over the next 15 months or so,"" Desch said. ""It's an incredibly complicated, highly-choreographed, highly-rehearsed and practiced set of maneuvers that is going to keep us incredibly busy.""

Desch said the successful launch Saturday ""only starts our efforts, which, frankly, I think is one of the more complicated things going on in the aerospace industry, and (that's) probably not well-understood. It's never been done before on a scale like this, where one network is completely replaced in space. We've been using the term 'tech refresh' ... It's one of the largest tech refreshes in history.""

The Iridium network relies on satellites spread out in six orbital lanes, each home to 11 active spacecraft, to provide uninterrupted global coverage.

The company's existing satellites were launched from 1997 through 2002 for missions originally scheduled to least eight years. Nevertheless, Desch said most of the satellites have outlived their design lives, and 64 of the 66 relay stations required for worldwide service remain operational.

Two satellites dropped offline last year, reducing Iridium's service availability to around 98 percent.

""We need reinforcements to replace the network,"" Desch said Friday. ""We haven't lost any other satellites, knock on wood, in at least six months or longer now. The current network is holding up fine. I would expect it will still be able to maintain that high performacne for another two or three years, at least, because the satellites are not showing signs of imminent decline.""

The last satellite to fall out of the Iridium network was running low on fuel, and other members of the fleet have succumbed to electronic failures. One satellite was destroyed in a violent in-space collision with a defunct Russian military satellite in 2009 in an incident infamous in space industry circles.

Battery health remains good across the Iridium fleet, Desch said.

""We still haven't lost any satellites from battery failures,"" he said. ""But they're getting old. Twenty years is a long time for a satellite, and maybe they can make it to 22, 23 or 24 years, but that's really pushing it on the network.""

The first two Iridium Next launches were slated to target the holes in the network, Desch said.

Saturday's flight was timed - to the second - to launch into Plane 6 of the constellation, where only 10 satellites remain operational.

The Iridium Next program is a $3 billion investment by Iridium. The purchase of 81 satellites represents approximately $2.2 billion of that cost, Desch said, and the company's launch contract with SpaceX for seven Falcon 9 flights was valued at $492 million when the parties signed it in 2010.

Desch said Iridium will scale back its capital expenditures once the new-generation fleet is up and running.

""That underpins all of this,"" Desch said. ""It's not just a technical marvel that we're doing, but it's also a financial transformation that we're not very far away from, finally, but we've got to get these satellites up first."""
2441386798,"SpaceX has successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket for the first time since its last effort, which resulted in an explosion on the launch pad. CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood joins CBSN to discuss the launch."
2441402239,"SpaceX got a big boost in confidence with the successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket. Back in September, one of its rockets went up in flames on a Florida launch pad. But it was a picture-perfect liftoff at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Carter Evans is at SpaceX headquarters with the details."
2441432636,"NASA's top, outside safety watchdogs have highlighted concerns about potential hazards associated with Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s plans to fly U.S. astronauts into orbit later this decade.

Fueling SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets with astronauts already strapped into capsules stacked on top entails major explosion risks and other uncertainties that need to be assessed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the aerospace safety advisory committee warned in a strongly worded annual report released last week.

Deciding to stick with the current concept ""should not be unduly influenced"" by factors such as schedule and budget concerns, the report said.

The panel also emphasized that safety trade-offs over the fueling issue can't be defined by what it called ""the best we can do given the constraints"" considerations.

When questioned about the report, a SpaceX spokesman on Saturday referred to earlier statements the company has made about its fueling procedure, which it said has received initial clearance from NASA.

The report is the second NASA advisory panel to raise similar red flags in the past year. A group chaired by Thomas Stafford , a former astronaut and retired Air Force lieutenant general, in 2015 first warned that SpaceX's fueling plans contradict decades of international space-launch policy.

Both NASA and the company, founded and run by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have said they are cooperating to assess safety issues. They have pledged repeatedly to launch crews only if all safety concerns are resolved.

-NASA also has promised to incorporate lessons learned from a pair of SpaceX explosions dating back to the summer of 2015.

Mr. Musk and his team want to use supercooled fuel to boost the power and increase fuel reserves of their Falcon 9 rockets. Such practices are central to SpaceX's ability to meet its goal of routinely reusing the most expensive parts of boosters on multiple launches.

But company officials have said they can't do that unless astronauts get on board befcore fueling, because crews wouldn't have enough time to climb into capsules after propellants are pumped into the rocket. The supercooled liquids have to be launched shortly after loading.

In September, an unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launchpad while it was being filled with propellants. Investigators determined the cause of the explosion stemmed from an unexpected interaction of liquid oxygen with a tank containing helium.

Industry and former NASA officials said the supercooled fueling procedure wasn't part of SpaceX's initial concept for building what are called commercial space taxis, intended to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting international space station. Missions could start in less than two years.

Described as a ""load and go"" procedure in the latest report, the safety advisory panel stressed that potentially complex interactions between propellants and other systems, as seen in the 2016 accident, ""may not be adequately understood, which results in a higher level of uncertainty that must be factored into the risk determination.""

The report also indicated that the panel remains concerned that some particularly difficult technical challenges could prevent NASA from meeting its standard of no more than a 1 in 270 chance of losing a crew during any given manned flight of commercial capsules being developed by SpaceX and Boeing Co.
Ongoing reviews of those issues have the potential to affect the budget, schedule and crew safety, according to the report.

The aerospace advisory panel's report, covering many other NASA safety issues, repeats qualms about SpaceX's fundamental fueling procedures raised earlier by a separate panel responsible for advising the agency about the safety of space-station operations.

NASA effectively told members of that panel, led by Gen. Stafford, to stand down from analyzing the issue and instructed them to refrain from publicly discussing their concerns."
2441540332,"VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites - a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader, Elon Musk, to the business of launching satellites to orbit.

But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk's long-range plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars.

SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif., has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services. The company's rockets had been grounded since then. An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial space launches, accepted SpaceX's report on the explosion's causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license, clearing the way for Saturday's liftoff here, on the other side of the country. To prevent a recurrence, SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium.

Saturday's countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a one-second window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes.

SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named ""Just Read the Instructions"" in the Pacific. Less than 90 minutes later, mission control received confirmation that all 10 satellites had been successfully deployed.

Over the next 14 months, the company plans six additional Falcon 9 launches to deploy 60 more Iridium satellites that will completely replace the constellation.

In the short-term, the successful launch helps put SpaceX back on track. The explosion and subsequent four-month grounding created a backlog of launches, including cargo missions for NASA to the International Space Station. September's explosion was SpaceX's second failure in 15 months; a Falcon 9 rocket carrying NASA cargo disintegrated in flight in June 2015.

On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX had lost $260 million in 2015 after the earlier accident, and revenue dropped 6 percent to $945 million. In earlier years, SpaceX officials including Mr. Musk described the company as consistently profitable; that claim has been removed from SpaceX's website.

Company officials did not dispute the numbers reported in The Wall Street Journal article, but portrayed a rosy future.

""Since 2002, we have been at the forefront of revolutionizing space technology, with a solid track record of success, strong customer relationships and more than 70 future launches on our manifest, representing over $10 billion in contracts,"" Bret Johnsen, SpaceX's chief financial officer, said in a statement. ""Furthermore, with over $1 billion in cash reserves and no debt, the company is in a financially strong position and is well positioned for future growth.""

SpaceX hopes to launch its larger Falcon Heavy this spring. The Heavy, years behind schedule, would become the world's most powerful rocket since NASA retired the Saturn 5 more than 40 years ago.

SpaceX also plans to refly one of its recovered boosters this spring. By reusing instead of throwing away rocket boosters, SpaceX hopes to significantly reduce the cost of launches.

Also on the schedule is an in-flight abort test of SpaceX's Dragon 2 capsule, a crucial safety prerequisite that it must conduct before the company can begin ferrying NASA astronauts to the space station next year.

By applying Silicon Valley entrepreneurial practices to aerospace, SpaceX has undercut prices and disrupted the rocket launch business. That brought in many customers like Iridium, which is paying more than $450 million for the seven launches. The next-lowest bid from one of SpaceX's competitors was $1.2 billion, said Matthew J. Desch, Iridium's chief executive.

Without SpaceX's lower costs, Iridium could not have afforded to replace its group of satellites, Mr. Desch said. ""The Falcon 9 is perfect for what we want to do,"" he said.

But the lower costs make it difficult to see how SpaceX could earn enough profit to finance its grand ambitions.

In September, Mr. Musk unveiled his vision for what he called the Interplanetary Transport System - a gigantic rocket with 42 engines that could take 100 passengers to Mars as early as 2024.

SpaceX has described plans to offer satellite internet services with more than 4,000 satellites. The forecasts described by The Wall Street Journal, which were produced in early 2016, show how much the company is depending on this new business.

SpaceX projected that current rocket launching business would quintuple in revenue, to $5 billion, in 2025. Satellite internet services, still in the early planning stages, were projected to bring in more than $30 billion in revenue and generate the bulk of more than $20 billion in profit for the company.

During the September announcement, Mr. Musk spoke of ""a huge public-private partnership"" to get to Mars, but did not describe what kind of partnership he foresaw. The incoming Trump administration has not outlined in detail its plans for NASA, although some of the president-elect's advisers, including Newt Gingrich, are pushing for a greater reliance on commercial companies like SpaceX.

Other Republicans, however, have been strong defenders of the Space Launch System, the big, expensive rocket that NASA is developing for a Mars mission."
2441543424,"SpaceX triumph!

Congratulations to SpaceX on Saturday morning's successful return to flight and launch from Vandenberg AFB, California, of 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc. Corrections to the problem experienced last September [when a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad] worked fine. Launch was on time and precisely on schedule.

The first stage successfully turned around, re-entered and landed on the drone ship just off Vandenberg. Video from the first stage was maintained all the way through touchdown. It was spectacular.

The second stage successfully placed itself and its payload into the transfer orbit. After reaching the right point about 40 minutes later, the second stage relighted briefly and finalized the orbit. All 10 satellites were successfully released in sequence as planned.

Well done, SpaceX!

Upcoming things to watch for 2017: more satellite launches, more cargo deliveries to the International Space Station and the first flight of the new Falcon Heavy rocket. Long may SpaceX's test site resound in our community!

Warped thinking

Once again, I find Pro-Life Waco director John Pisciotta's narrow-minded, skewed view of the world preposterous. Pisciotta's Jan. 11 letter takes a statement referring to the act of making fun of and humiliating someone with a physical disability into a bully pulpit for his personal agenda and hatred of Planned Parenthood. It amazed me how he turned this statement upside-down and inside-out and related it to abortion, Planned Parenthood and his ridiculous statistic referring to Down syndrome.

Can even he think it's OK to make fun of people?

Huckabee for BU

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Baylor Bear Foundation legend Carroll Webb in his Sunday column proposed that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee be considered for the Baylor University presidency. I sent this suggestion to the search committee headed by Bob Brewton about a month ago.

I am so excited that I am not the only one who had this thought. I believe Huckabee has all the qualities to be the president of Baylor. He has proven executive skills (he served as governor from 1996 to 2007), is a former Baptist pastor and certainly has experience in the public sector. He has conservative views, which are certainly needed on the university scene. I hope the committee will look at him and give him a look-see.

2441558903,SpaceX says it successfully launched 10 satellites on first flight since September accident.
2441607020,"Watch the first SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lift off since a catastrophic launch pad explosion at Cape Canaveral in September 2016. The rocket, launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on January 14, 2017, was carrying 10 satellites for the Iridium mobile phone and Internet communications company. The Falcon 9 first stage was successfully recovered after landing on a floating platform in the Pacific."
2441642948,"With Billions and Billions of dollars at stake and their reputation riding on the line, SpaceX came roaring back to life by dramatically executing a picture perfect Falcon 9 rocket launch this morning (Jan. 14) that successfully delivered a fleet of ten advanced Iridium NEXT mobile voice and data relay satellites to orbit while simultaneously recovering the first stage on a ship at sea off the west coast of California.

BREAKING NEWS - check back for updates.

The primary goal of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch from Space Launch Complex 4E on Vandenberg Air Force Base in California was to deploy the payload of the first ten Iridium Next communication satellites to low Earth orbit on the Iridium-1 mission.

""Thanks @elonmusk - a perfect flight! Loved watching sats deploy with you in the control room,"" tweeted Matt Desch, Iridium Communications CEO, soon after receiving full confirmation that all 10 Iridium NEXT satellites were successfully deployed from their second stage satellite dispensers.

""More to go, but now to celebrate!!""

The inaugural ten will serve as the vanguard of a fleet that will eventually comprise 81 satellites.

Today's successful blastoff took place barely four and a half months after another Falcon 9 and its $200 million Israeli commercial payload were suddenly destroyed during a prelaunch fueling test on the Florida Space Coast on Sept. 1, 2016.

Another launch failure would have dealt a devastating blow to confidence in SpaceX's hard won reputation.

The Sept. 1, 2016 calamity was the second Falcon 9 failure within 15 months time. Both occurred inside the second stage and called into question the rockets reliability.

The 229-foot (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket was rolled out from its processing hangar to the launch pad and raised vertically yesterday.

Today's entire land, landing and satellite deployment event was shown live on a SpaceX hosted webcast. It offered extremely sharp views of Saturdays on time liftoff at 9:54:34 a.m. PST or 12:54:34 p.m. EST, and unbelievably clear images of the first stage descending back to Earth towards a tiny drone ship.

""Overall a wonderfully nominal mission,"" gushed the SpaceX commentator during the webcast.

Since the Iridium 1 mission only had an instantaneous launch opportunity precisely at 9:54:34 a.m. PST or 12:54:34 p.m. EST, there was no margin for any technical or weather delays. And none happened. Although an errant boat had to be quickly escorted out of the exclusion zone less than 20 minutes before blastoff.

Confirmation of a successful deployment of all 10 Iridium NEXT satellites came at about T plus 1 hour and 17 minutes after liftoff from Vandenberg.

""So, so excited - finally breathing again!"" tweeted Desch.

""Thanks for all the great vibes - I felt it! All 10 sats deployed; good orbit; good telemetry! WOW.""

The mobile relay satellites were delivered into a circular orbit at an altitude of 625 kilometers (388 miles) above Earth.

They were released one at a time from a pair of specially designed satellite dispensers at approximately 100 second intervals.

""It was a clean sweep, 10 for 10,"" said SpaceX commentator John Insprucker during the live webcast.

""All the bridge wires show open, and that is a conclusion of the primary mission today, a great one for the first stage, second stage, and the customer's satellites deployed into a good orbit.""

The Iridium NEXT satellites were built by Thales Alenia and Orbital ATK.

In the final moments before the propulsive landing, you could read the lettering on the ""Just Read the Instructions"" drone ship as the engine was firing to slow the descent and the landing legs deployed.

Really there was no cutout or loss of signal the whole way down. So the world could watch every key moment as it happened in real time.

The first stage softly landed approx. 8 minutes and 18 seconds after the California liftoff.

""First stage has landed on Just Read the Instructions,"" SpaceX tweeted post landing.

This was the first launch by SpaceX since last August from the Florida Space Coast, and it came off without a hitch.

Iridium 1 is the first of seven planned Falcon 9 launches to establish the Iridium NEXT constellation which will eventually consist of 81 advanced satellites.

At least 70 will be launched by SpaceX.

The inaugural launch of the advanced Iridium NEXT satellites will start the process of replacing an aging Iridium fleet in orbit for nearly two decades.

This Falcon 9 was been outfitted with four landing lags and grid fins for a controlled landing on the tiny barge prepositioned in the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles off the west coast of California.

Watch this space for continuing updates on SpaceX.

Stay tuned here for Ken's continuing Earth and Planetary science and human spaceflight news."
2441649051,"A round of congratulations are in order for SpaceX , as the Elon Musk-led agency successfully returned to flight on Saturday with the launch of a rocket that delivered 10 satellites into orbit, followed by a first stage booster landing atop a drone ship in the Pacific Ocean. This was SpaceX's first launch in over four months, following the August launchpad explosion of their previous rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The Falcon 9 rocket departed just before 1:00PM ET on Saturday from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base, launching 10 communications satellites into orbit for the company Iridium. Afterwards, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth to land upright atop a floating platform off the California coast, marking SpaceX's seventh successful landing.

The launch was one of the most important for the private space agency, as it was their first return to operations since their prior accident, in which a rocket mysteriously exploded without warning , had left them grounded until now. While the company lost one of their Falcon 9 rockets and its payload, a $200 million communications satellite, they managed to identify the cause and take precautions to make sure it doesn't happen again.

This all took place in the span of just four months, an even shorter turnaround than the six months it took SpaceX to return to flight following a rocket explosion in June 2015. This flies in the face of the nine months to years it has taken other companies to recover from the loss of a vehicle.

Once SpaceX closed its investigation into the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration accepted their results, and in turn gave the company a license that covers the seven launches need to put 70 satellites into orbit for Iridium. Saturday's launch was the first, with the remainder to take place throughout this year and next."
2441766118,"SpaceX has successfully returned to space after an accident inSpaceX has successfully returned to space, launching its first Falcon 9 rocket since an accident in September destroyed a rocket on the launch pad along with its payload. Launches had been halted in the interim as the company investigated the cause of the accident. The company also successfully delivered communications satellites into orbit for its customer, Iridium.

With this successful launch, SpaceX plans to return to its regular launch schedule. Prior to its accident in September, the company had eight successful launches in 2016, averaging about one launch per month. Additionally, the company was recently awarded additional crewed commercial flights by NASA as part of a contract awarded to it.

 September destroyed one of its rockets.

In addition to a successful launch, this flight also saw a successful landing. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket successfully returned to Earth, making a landing on the drone ship Just Read The Instructions. This is the second drone ship that has successfully received the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket.

Landing and reusing rockets is part of SpaceX's long-term vision of reducing the cost of its missions to its customers. It ambitiously plans to reduce the cost of its rockets from the current $61 million to between $5-7 million. The first launch with a recycled rocket was previously slated for the Fall of 2016, but a new date has not yet been announced."
2441774964,"CAPE CANAVERAL - Meteorologists are anticipating favorable odds of good weather during the countdown to launch an Atlas 5 rocket and U.S. military satellite on Thursday evening from Cape Canaveral.

The day's 40-minute launch opportunity that is timed to deliver the satellite into the correct orbital position opens at 7:46 p.m. EST (0046 GMT).

The United Launch Alliance booster will deploy the Space Base Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit satellite No. 3, or SBIRS GEO Flight 3, to provide missile detection and early-warning notices of incoming threats.

The Air Force's 45th Weather Squadron at the Cape predicts a 70 percent chance of acceptable launch conditions. The area of concern for launch will be cumulus clouds and cloud thickness.

The specifics for the launch window include scattered low-level and broken high-level clouds, good visibility, winds from the southwest at 10 to 14 knots, a relative humidity of 80 percent and a temperature of 72 degrees F.

""On launch day, a surface trough pushes into North Florida with moisture gradually increasing through the day. Isolated showers are possible mid to late afternoon. Westerly winds in the steering levels will bring interior showers toward the east coast. Near sunset and with the loss of diurnal heating, showers are expected to trend down,"" Air Force meteorologists said today.

""The primary concern for launch is cumulus clouds and thick clouds associated with the proximity of the surface trough and upper level disturbance.""

In the event of a 24-hour delay, the forecast for Friday evening calls for increasing clouds in the mid- and upper-levels are expected as another surface trough approaches Florida's Big Bend area, meteorologists say.

There is a 60 percent chance of acceptable launch conditions on Friday.

The flight will originate from Complex 41, and the rocket will be rolled from its assembly building to the pad on Wednesday morning.

Public viewing options for the evening launch are somewhat limited given the timing of liftoff.

The optimal spot - Playalinda Beach- closes at sundown, nearly two hours before the launch window opens.

That leaves the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex as having the closest available spots. Its main campus 7.1 miles away (although without a direct view of the pad) and the Apollo/Saturn V Center located 5.4 miles away. Either site has admission fees, however.

The nearest free public viewing location offering the best view is Route 401 in Port Canaveral, some 11.7 miles from the launch pad.

Viewing options are described by LaunchPhotography.com.

Get directions there .

The Atlas 5 will generate 860,000 pounds of thrust from its main engine, rising on a pillar of fire to lift the 10,000-pound SBIRS GEO Flight 3 satellite into space.

The rocket will head due east from the Cape en route to a geosynchronous transfer orbit.

It will be the year's first launch from Cape Canaveral."
2441781110,"Early Saturday morning Jan. 14, SpaceX successfully launched ten communication satellites made by Iridium - one of its largest satellite customers - into low earth orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The mission, part of a larger effort to replace at least 70 of Iridium's satellites by 2018, was a much-needed positive start to what should be a busy year for SpaceX.

SpaceX has a lot to accomplish in 2017, but it's crucial to remember that all of this is in service of the company's ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. That's why each commercial launch is critical for the company Elon Musk founded 15 years ago. Not only is it proving that the technology works, but each contract is helping Musk fund his ambitious and expensive mission to colonize Mars.

Saturday's unblemished execution - from launch, to completing the mission of deploying the satellites, to landing back on its drone ship - is a good sign for the company, particularly after one of its $60 million rockets exploded with a $200 million satellite on it last August.

About those Mars flights: During a presentation in September , Musk said he planned to begin sending unmanned rockets to Mars in 2018, and if all goes well, send rockets with humans in them to Mars by 2024. But he conceded that his contracts with NASA, Iridium and others won't sufficiently pay for the company's interplanetary ambitions.

Instead, it will require massive public-private partnerships, he said.

Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.

- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 14, 2017

So this year is a really important and busy one for SpaceX. Nailing each launch isn't just important for the money, but also to ensure faith in the company's abilities isn't shaken, thus allowing SpaceX to potentially strike new commercial contracts.

That's especially true now that companies like Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Moon Express - which just raised enough money to fund its maiden voyage to the moon - are becoming more aggressive about their interplanetary goals. Blue Origin , in fact, expects to launch people in its rockets by the end of 2017 and start commercial flights in 2018.

SpaceX's 2017 goal - 20 launches - is slightly more ambitious than last year, when the company only completed eight of 18 expected launches. (And only four of those rockets successfully landed back on the drone ship - necessary if SpaceX wants to avoid replacing expensive rockets for each launch.)

SpaceX is also targeting November for a demonstration of its ability to launch a rocket to the International Space Station, as part of a contract with NASA to ultimately bring astronauts to the space station.

It's early yet, but Saturday's launch of the Iridium 1 is a good sign for what's to come.

"
2441837419,"It was supposed to break new ground, but only highlighted problems with the space program.

Japan's space program troubles aren't over yet, apparently. The country's Aerospace Exploration Agency reports that the launch of its miniature SS-520 rocket ended in failure. The first stage went off without a hitch, but communications problems prevented the second stage from igniting and carrying a microsatellite, TRICOM 1, into orbit. While rocket failures certainly aren't unheard of (just ask SpaceX), the incident is a black eye given what Japan wanted to achieve.

SS-520 was billed as the world's smallest-ever satellite launch vehicle, measuring just 35 feet long and 20 inches wide -- it was supposed to be a record-setter that made a case for tiny satellites. After all, it's considerably more efficient than the giant rockets and satellites that were the standard until recently. This certainly doesn't mean that the mini rocket dream is dead, but JAXA will definitely want to make sure that its next launches go according to plan."
2441880964,"The ""place for space.""

That's the motto I came up with 23 years ago for the first Space Day in Tallahassee. But a more accurate phrasing would have been ""Florida is the place for space launches,"" because that's all there was, launches, with nearly all the shots financed by the U.S. Government.

In 1997 and 2000, I wrote a pair of editorials for Space News lamenting the harsh business conditions commercial launchers faced at the Cape. My analysis: WYSIWYG. What you see is what you get. The launch business was static, the rocket family old, the Cape's launch manifest stable but not growing.

Three years ago, I wrote a column here updating my pessimism, suggesting that just maybe new ""shooters,"" a more accommodating Air Force, and the growing mass of data to be moved might improve the space business here.

Now? Wow! Florida is becoming the place for all kinds of space business. We're riding a space boom.

What changed? Why optimism? Where did this space prosperity come from? Three sources:

• The Moorman Report. You've never heard of it, right? In the early '90s, General Tom Moorman authored a national study offering four options for the future of unmanned space launches. The Air Force signed off on his Option Two recommending a significant upgrade to the existing family of launch rockets. You see his vision as reality with every launch of the new Delta-4s and Atlas-5s. We've got good rockets.

• The end of the shuttle program. Knowing that cash cow was dying, space interests started working for the future rather than just milking the past.

• The information revolution. It turned into the data explosion: commercial space had to find a bigger ride.

With these factors as boosters, Brevard space has taken off.

The prime movers of this growth are the huge expansion of space-based data transfer and the number of commercial launches serving that need, a good share of the work coming here.

Brevard has done a lot to foster this growth.

We voted overwhelmingly to renew our strong incentives for new business and to put money into our schools and the Indian River Lagoon to keep Brevard attractive to new companies.

The North Brevard Economic Development Zone is going strong. The Port is investing up north, too.

Exploration Park, the Space Florida/KSC industrial park at the Space Center, is open for business.

Great leadership at Space Florida and the EDC successfully brought in a breed of space business we'd not had before: manufacturing. We have two big, new plants going up at Exploration Park, for a rocket maker (Blue Origin) and, right next door, for a satellite builder (OneWeb).

Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, a pair of digital-age fat cats, are bringing us new launch methods, new rockets, and new ideas, rethinking space-launch as a profit center.

With this new commercial funding flooding in, we're a bit less dependent on Congress for our space business and less hurt by congressional propensity to spend federal space money elsewhere as pork.

The Air Force and our 45th Space Wing have become true enablers of commercial launch. NASA has finally decided that commercial-space cooperation is good for NASA.

And while we're keeping score, let's not forget the first ""A"" in NASA: aeronautics. With Embraer's large and growing footprint, Northrop-Grumman's relocating its headquarters here and expanding, and Melbourne Airport's success serving commercial aviation, Brevard is becoming the place for major aeronautical enterprise too.

Alas, all this could change. The legacy space companies face a more competitive, less welcoming business climate. Hurricanes are always a threat. Rising sea levels now, too. Many think the Trump Administration is scary and unpredictable, trade barriers and a declining economy potentially crippling the space business. The local cranks who hate economic development (and apparently love higher taxes) might gain an upper hand. No one can fully predict the future.

But what we see now is encouraging. Brevard's space landscape has changed dramatically and for the better. We truly have become ... The Space Coast."
2441881199,"Falcon rockets are launching - and landing - again.

More than four months after one exploded on a Cape Canaveral launch pad, a SpaceX Falcon 9 blasted off at 12:54 p.m. EST from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and delivered 10 commercial satellites to orbit.

About eight minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster flew down from the edge of space to an unpiloted ship floating in the Pacific Ocean. Four landing legs touched down softly on an ""X"" at the center of the ""drone ship"" deck.

The booster was the first that SpaceX has recovered during a West Coast launch, and the seventh overall since late 2015. The company hopes to launch a satellite soon on a used booster, a capability CEO Elon Musk believes will cut launch costs and eventually make missions to Mars affordable.

Meanwhile, the rocket's upper-stage continued flying in a north-south orbit with 10 Iridium Communications satellites, the first of 70 SpaceX is contracted to launch by early next year.

After some suspense when a ground station failed to relay telemetry from the rocket, SpaceX confirmed all 10 Iridium NEXT satellites had been deployed about 90 minutes after liftoff.

The spacecraft, each weighing about a ton and the size of a Mini Cooper, started a $3 billion replacement of Iridium's aging low Earth orbit constellation, whose first satellites are nearly two decades old.

The upgraded network will improve mobile voice and data connections around the globe, and enable new services including real-time tracking of aircraft and ships from space that are important to the company's growth prospects.

""Today Iridium launches a new era in the history of our company and a new era in space as we start to deliver the next generation of satellite communications,"" CEO Matt Desch, said in a statement.

With its successful return to flight, SpaceX could be ready to launch a commercial satellite from Florida as soon as Jan. 26. That launch will be the company's first from historic pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the launching point for Apollo moon shots and dozens of space shuttle missions.

SpaceX's other Space Coast pad, Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, awaits repairs after the Sept. 1 blast.

Saturday's successful mission also was good news for NASA. The space agency hopes to see SpaceX launch supplies to the International Space Station next month, and is overseeing the company's preparations to launch astronauts to the outpost next year.

The September explosion was the SpaceX's second major failure in 14 months, after a Falcon 9 disintegrated minutes into an ISS supply flight in June 2015.

This time, investigators determined there was a breach in the system that pressurizes super-cold liquid oxygen in the rocket's upper stage.

SpaceX reconfigured gaseous helium tanks situated inside the rocket's liquid oxygen tanks, and loaded the helium at a warmer temperature during fueling.

That change was expected to prevent solid oxygen from rubbing against carbon wraps covering the helium tanks, the likely source of friction that sparked the September blaze. In addition to the Falcon 9, the explosion destroyed a $200 million satellite that Facebook had planned to used to expand Internet access in Africa.

The revised fueling process appeared to work flawlessly on Saturday.

""What an awesome way to start the New Year,"" SpaceX engineer Lauren Lyons said during at the conclusion of the company's launch broadcast.

Now SpaceX's challenge is to sustain a full year of launches, including several more for Iridium.

""I really think they've demonstrated the ability to launch multiple satellites in a single month, and they could pull it off,"" Desch before the launch. ""They're very close to being the high-rate supplier they have envisioned to be. And we need them to do that this year just to meet our requirements."""
2441881203,"Mission managers will gather Tuesday to review their readiness for Cape Canaveral's first rocket launch of 2017, a planned 7:46 p.m. Thursday blastoff by a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and a U.S. missile warning satellite.

Teams last Thursday hoisted the roughly 10,000-pound spacecraft worth $1.2 billion atop the Atlas V at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 41.

The Lockheed Martin-built Space Based Infrared System satellite is equipped with infrared sensors to provide early detection and tracking of ballistic missiles.

Known as SBIRS GEO-3, the spacecraft will be the third placed in a geostationary orbit more than 22,000 miles over the equator, where it will appear to fly in a fixed position above the planet. A fourth SBIRS satellite is expected to launch late this year to complete the operational constellation.

The Atlas V rocket is expected to roll a quarter-mile from its processing tower to the launch pad on Wednesday. A 40-minute launch window opens at 7:46 p.m.

The mission is ULA's first of at least 11 planned this year, including seven from Florida.

ULA last Thursday also made progress preparing for its second launch of the year, lifting a Delta IV rocket booster vertical at Launch Complex 37. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Air Force's ninth Wideband Global Satcom communications satellite on March 8. The WGS-9 satellite arrived at the Cape last week.

Flight hardware also arrived for ULA's third planned launch, as Orbital ATK delivered a Cygnus spacecraft's cargo module to Kennedy Space Center. An Atlas V is targeting a March 16 launch of supplies to the International Space Station.

Moon Express funded for private moon shot

Cape Canaveral-based Moon Express has secured $20 million in new investment that ensures the company can attempt to launch a small robotic lander to the moon as soon as the end of this year, the company announced Friday.

""We now have all the resources in place to shoot for the moon,"" Moon Express co-founder and CEO Bob Richards said in a statement.

The private moon shot will blast off from New Zealand on Rocket Lab's new Electron rocket, which has not yet flown.

Meanwhile, Moon Express has begun renovating the former Delta II launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to serve as its base for testing the washing machine-sized MX-1E spacecraft.

A successful lunar landing this year could position the company to claim the $20 million grand prize in the Google Lunar XPRIZE.

The prize will go to the first privately developed lander to touch down, maneuver to another location and beam back high-definition images.

Moon Express has longer-term ambitions to establish a low-cost lunar transportation service that could enable science missions, mining of water ice and perhaps some day sending people to the surface.

""Our goal is to expand Earth's social and economic sphere to the moon, our largely unexplored eighth continent, and enable a new era of low cost lunar exploration and development for students, scientists, space agencies and commercial interests,"" said Richards.

Last year, Moon Express became the first company to win U.S. government approval to fly a commercial deep space mission.

In total, the company says it has raised more than $45 million in private investment from individuals and venture capital sources including Founders Fund, Collaborative Fund and Autodesk.

The man whose name is a byword for billionaire. Gates co-founded Microsoft in the mid-70s, growing it into the world's biggest software company and helping to make computers a household item. He quit as CEO in 2000 and pledged to devote his fortune to his philanthropic activities in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He has gradually reduced his ownership in Microsoft to less than 3 percent, with the bulk of his wealth in a private firm. He's the only one on the list who's a regular at Davos.

___

Amancio Ortega: $67 billion

The richest person in Europe, Ortega opened the first Zara fashion shop in 1975. Now, the chain, part of Ortega's Inditex group, has 7,000 shops globally. Its boom in popularity is largely due to a low cost model that competes with the likes of H&M. As Zara and Inditex grew in size, Ortega, a Spaniard, held on to a majority stake of 59 percent in the company, which has a market value of over 97 billion euros ($102 billion).

___

Warren Buffett: $60.8 billion

The Oracle of Omaha, as he's known for the way his every investment decision is followed by thousands. Buffett began investing as a teenager in the 1940s and gradually grew his firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett, 86, is notoriously frugal and favors investing in companies with proven business models over new industries, such as in technology. He's said he will give away the bulk of his wealth to philanthropy. Since 2006, he's been donating blocks of Berkshire stock to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

___

Carlos Slim Helu: $50 billion

The Mexican tycoon owes his fortune to a major ownership in America Movil, a telecommunications multinational worth $42 billion. He personally owns about 7 percent in the company while his broader family retains a 37 percent stake. He was ranked as the richest person three years ago, but saw his net worth hit by a downturn in Latin American economies. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to scrap free trade deals and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border have also hurt shares in his business interests. Forbes estimates his net worth dropped $5 billion in the four days after Trump's election.

___

Jeff Bezos: $45.2 billion

The founder and CEO of Amazon.com helped revolutionize the retail industry by popularizing online shopping. What was initially an online book shop now sells pretty much anything. Bezos has reached beyond Amazon, in which he holds a 17 percent stake, to try his hand in other industries. He's bought the Washington Post and set up an aerospace company, Blue Origin, that aims to make space accessible to tourists and paying customers.

___

Mark Zuckerberg: $44.6 billion

He founded Facebook in 2004 while a college student to connect other Harvard students. The company went on to become popular globally and listed its shares publicly in 2012, making Zuckerberg, now 32, a multibillionaire. He's managed to make Facebook profitable where rivals like Twitter have lagged, and expanded it with targeted acquisitions. He and his wife have pledged to sell 99 percent of their holdings in Facebook - over 400 million shares, worth about $50 billion - to support philanthropic causes.

___

Larry Ellison: $43.6 billion

As a young programmer in the '70s, Ellison's first big client was the CIA. The name of the project was ""Oracle."" In 1977, Ellison and associates used that name for their company, which creates software that helps manage databases and has since become an industry standard. Ellison has recently focused more on cloud computing, in which data is stored and managed across a network of computers. His fortune comes from the 27 percent stake he still owns in Oracle, a company worth $160 billion.

___

Michael Bloomberg: $40 billion

Created the eponymous financial information provider in 1981 after getting laid off from an investment bank. Bloomberg made it a lucrative business in particular by selling data terminals to financial services firms. The multi-screen terminals became essential tools in the industry, incorporating real-time market information with a news service. Bloomberg, who reportedly retains an 88 percent stake in the privately held company, turned to politics in 2001, becoming mayor of New York City for three terms."
2442077693,"If he had more time as America's transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx says he would want to work on rail projects across the country.

""Far too few communities are really taking aggressive steps,"" Foxx said on the latest episode of Recode Decode .

But in his three and a half years on the job, he has also contended with a potential private competitor to high-speed rail: Hyperloop, a tube-based travel system conceptualized in 2013 by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which would carry passengers and freight at more than 700 miles per hour. Foxx said applying current railway regulations to Hyperloop ""would be like putting a square peg in a round hole.""

""The technology, the science behind it, is very sound,"" he said. ""But it's one of those examples of, the technology may be there before the government is.""

Unlike autonomous cars, which are similar enough to normal cars that the Department of Transportation has been able to start issuing federal guidelines , Hyperloop would require Congressional action before the DoT can ""jump into it with two feet"" and start making rules, he noted. And for that reason, as with drones , companies such as Hyperloop One may find it easier to start in other countries first.

""Getting the service is different than generating the ideas and generating the intellectual capital,"" Foxx said. ""We in the U.S., one of our greatest virtues and one of the biggest challenges for us, is that when new transportation technology is introduced, something like Hyperloop, [they] say 'We want to be first.' A lot of the time, we say, 'We want to be safest.' And I think that's a good thing for us.""

However, would Foxx ride in a Hyperloop if given the chance?

""I hope one day that I do,"" he said. ""I'm not going to go to the moon, but Hyperloop, I might do.""

2442084248,Every time I watch the @SpaceX rocket landing I'm fucking totally blown away
2442105433,@Melissa__Hanson @AlexKHall we watched the @SpaceX launch this weekend. No football in our house!
2442146694,"NAILED IT! 
Amazing to watch...
Scientist celebrated after Spacex Falcon 9 landed successfully this past weekend.
It's the company;s first launch since an unmanned rocket exploded three months ago."
2442170841,Incredible footage of SpaceX flawlessly landing its first Falcon 9 rocket of the year.
2442210999,Here's how much it actually costs SpaceX when one of its rockets explodes Dave Mosher https://t.co/1SApufgnvx
2442215064,"Launching for the first time in four-and-a-half months, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Saturday morning with 10 satellites for Iridium's space-based message relay network.

Towering 229 feet (70 meters) tall and measuring 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter, the two-stage rocket fired into the sky on top of 1.7 million pounds of thrust, powering south over the Pacific Ocean en route to an orbit more than 380 miles (610 kilometers) above Earth.

These photos from remote sound-triggered cameras around the Space Launch Complex 4-East launch pad, and from a nearby viewing site, show the commercial booster taking off from Vandenberg."
2442227635,"Launch of Falcon 9 comes as new documents reveal the state of SpaceX's finances.

Those documents show a steady increase in launch revenue at the company from 2011 through 2014, dipping in 2015 because of a launch failure. That failure resulted in a loss of a quarter billion dollars.

The documents also reveal that the company expects launch revenue to continue to grow, but be eclipsed by much faster growth in revenue from a planned constellation of broadband satellites.

That system is projected to generate more than $30 billion a year in revenue by 2025. [Wall Street Journal]"
2442242501,"After the fanfare of SpaceX's return to flight, Japan attempted to launch a rocket of its own on Saturday - but the vehicle failed to achieve orbit. It was the launch of a tiny, experimental rocket called the SS-520-4, which was carrying a lone 6.6-pound satellite, called TRICOM-1, into orbit. While the first part of the launch went as planned, a communications failure during flight ultimately prompted flight controllers to abort the mission. As a result the rocket and the satellite it was carrying fell back into the ocean, according to an update from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

This was the first flight of the SS-520-4, a modified version of Japan's SS-520 sounding rocket that's used to deliver research payloads to altitudes 621 miles up (or 1,000 km). The updated SS-520-4 had been given an extra third stage, meaning a third engine had been placed on the top of the vehicle, to help give the satellite the extra boost it would need achieve orbit.

Take off of the SS-520-4 occurred at 8:33AM Japan Time from Uchinoura Space Observatory, and initially everything was going smoothly. But about 20 seconds into flight, however, JAXA stopped receiving communication from the rocket, so the rest of the launch was aborted. JAXA confirmed that the first and second stage of the rocket separated as planned, but the ignition of the second stage was stopped. The rocket and satellite fell into an expected spot in the ocean southeast of Uchinoura.

If the launch had been successful, it would have been the smallest rocket to ever put an object into orbit around Earth, according to NASASpaceflight.com. The SS-520-4 stands at just over 31 feet tall and it's only 20 inches in diameter, according to JAXA. The point of the mission was to demonstrate that such a small rocket could launch the TRICOM-1 satellite, which was going to take pictures of Earth from space."
2442260393,"This video of SpaceX's launch Saturday from 8,500 feet is shaky, but pretty cool nonetheless. https://t.co/Nc608yqPLo"
2442260396,Truly amazing that we can land a rocket like this. Cheers SpaceX https://t.co/aY3iGwaWt0
2442267812,"@d3rrial @SpaceX You're right; when I read about it it sounded to me like it was the wrapping, not the liner. I fixed the post."
2442285676,"SpaceX shows us a thing or two, Facebook fights fraudulent facts in German and drones are fulfilling their long-told prophecy. All that and more in The Daily Crunch for January 16, 2017. Stream 'em if you got 'em.

1. SpaceX does the damn thing

SpaceX had a lot to prove Saturday with its first launch since a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launchpad in September last year. And prove it they did, with a successful launch, a successful mission for Iridium, and a successful recovery of the first stage of their rocket.

Basically it couldn't have gone better for SpaceX in terms of showing the world it's ready to fly again, which is exactly what it needed to do in order to keep landing new customers and build out its crowded launch manifest even further. Plus we got our coolest ever video of the rocket's POV of landing back on SpaceX's autonomous barge. Nice.

2. Facebook fake news trial heads to Germany

Facebook has tools in trial to try to take on its fake news problem, and now it's expanding availability to Germany. The timing might be perfect since the same fake news engine that helped Trump out during the U.S. election is now setting its sights on Germany - apparently perfectly in line with Russia's political agenda.

3. Drone destiny

Drones have long seemed like something that will become am omnipresent fixture of modern life very soon, but that 'soon' hasn't yet come. Jon argues it's finally just about here, and presents a lot of evidence to that effect. Are you ready to drone?

4. Udacity digs deep (learning)

If you're curious about where big tech hiring dollars are heading, just check out Udacity and its latest nanodegree programs. The online education startup is basically a bellwether for hot industry trends at this point, and its new Deep Learning foundational nanodegree program is no exception. I'd be curious to try out the six month sprint to see whether or not this deep learning education is itself shallow.

5. Airbus wants to give you that flying car in 2017 - in beta

Flying cars - Airbus wants to make them happen, and it's targeting the end of this year for a prototype flight. That's good news for urban congestion, provided they can make it happen safely and cost-effectively. Plus, flying freaking cars!

6. This is the best new all-around media streamer

Built-in Google Cast, access to AAA console games and the most 4K HDR streaming sources available? Yes, Nvidia's new Shield has all that, plus latent features that will enable Google Assistant to turn it into a strong Amazon Echo competitor with an update coming later. Sounds like a category-killer - and performs like one, too.

7. Samsung could be pulled into the ongoing Korean political scandal

Well that's no good: Coming off the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung cold become entangled in the scandal that toppled Korean President Park Gun-hye, because of ties between her and Samsung familial leader Jay Y. Lee. When it rains it pours."
2442337795,"WASHINGTON - The second of two all-electric satellites fleet operator Eutelsat gained through its acquisition of Satmex began service Jan. 16 after finishing a seven-month journey to its orbital location, Eutelsat announced.

Eutelsat 117 West B launched last June on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with ABS-2A, a similar all-electric satellite Boeing built for Bermuda-based ABS. Both satellites formed the second set in a four-satellite order paired with Falcon 9 dual launches. ABS and Satmex, now Eutelsat Americas, praised the deal as producing substantial cost savings, while accepting the tradeoff that it would take months instead of days for their spacecraft to reach their final orbits.

Despite the hype that surrounded ABS and Satmex's 2012 group purchase of four all-electric Boeing 702SP satellites, Boeing has yet to close a similar deal.

Satellites using all-electric propulsion can weigh as little has half those equipped with chemical propulsion. Operators can use this mass savings to pack bigger payloads onto a spacecraft platform or, as was the case of Eutelsat and ABS, make due with smaller satellites and save on launch costs.

Eutelsat 117 West B, known as Satmex 9 before Paris-based Eutelsat acquired the Mexican satellite operator in 2013, carries 48 Ku-band transponders, covering Latin America and the Caribbean. The satellite also hosts the Wide Area Augmentation System payload that Raytheon will operate for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to increase the accuracy of GPS signals for aircraft starting in 2018.

Now in geostationary orbit, the satellite forms a new neighborhood at 117 degrees west with the Space Systems Loral-built Eutelsat 117 West A, which launched in 2013 aboard an International Launch Services Proton rocket as Satmex 8. Eutelsat Americas handles capacity sales for the satellites.

Eutelsat's first all-electric satellite from the 2012 Boeing order (Eutelsat 115 West B, or Satmex 7 as it was previously known) was launched in March 2015 and reached its geostationary perch a monthly early thanks to a better than expected performance from the Falcon 9 rocket that carried it into orbit along with ABS-3A. The ABS satellite entered service that August; Eutelsat's satellite went live that October.

With Eutelsat 117 West B's deployment now completed, only one of the four satellites from ABS and Satmex's 2012 order has yet to enter service: ABS-2A. ABS has not said when the satellite, which carries 48 transponders and five high-powered Ku-band beams, will reach its orbital slot at 75 degrees east.

Eutelsat has ordered more all-electric satellites since 2012, but not from Boeing. Space Systems Loral got Eutelsat's order for Eutelsat 7C, Airbus Defence and Space got the order for Eutelsat 172B, and Thales Alenia Space is building Eutelsat's Africa Broadband Satellite.

ABS went back to Boeing in 2015 for an all-electric design for ABS-8. But that order, which was contingent on U.S Export-Import Bank financing, was canceled when Ex-Im was forced to shut its doors that summer when its congressional authorization expired. (The bank reopened at the end of 2015 but still can't finance big satellite projects because Congress hasn't allowed the White House to fill board vacancies preventing the bank from approving deals above $10 million.)

ABS still intends to order an ABS-8 satellite. ABS CEO Tom Choi said late last year that he wants a design that offers higher-throughput than the satellite he was ready to buy from Boeing in 2015. Choi said that ABS still wants to buy American and the Boeing remains in the running."

2442426521,"The last twelve months have been monumental for astronomers, physicists, and fellow enthusiasts of the cosmos. From the most powerful supernova recorded , to the discovery of gravitational waves that validate Einstein , to huge advancements in our efforts to colonize Mars , it's obvious that the cosmos has opened up to us in 2016.

In January, the most powerful supernova ever recorded began the year with a bang. At it's peak output, the supernova was 600 billion times brighter than our sun, and 20 times as bright as the entire stellar throughput of the Milky Way. The discovery of the supernova was important because it helped substantiate theories about magnetars (incredibly massive stars with unfathomable magnetic fields). Essentially, it showed us that similarly sized stars have to exist for such a supernova to occur.

Then we have the discovery of gravitational waves in February. We knew Einstein's theory of relativity was always right-- we just never had a clue why. The collision of two black holes warped space-time and left raptures the size of galaxies in its wake. We were able to pick up this explosion in the form of gravitational waves as they whispered into our atmosphere. The beauty of that is truly striking: a collision capable of destroying entire galaxies entered our atmosphere in the form of barely audible whispers. These gravitational waves were the first non-light signals we could pick up from space, meaning we could sequence data from before light even existed.

Let's not leave planetary science out of this discussion. In July, Juno finally reached Jupiter and began examining the beautiful mystery of the gas giant. Cassini also bolstered our knowledge of Saturn as it was able to elucidate much of the planet's electrical and chemical identity. Most importantly, however, Curiosity has been in constant contact with NASA as it continues to traverse the red planet.

In September, SpaceX managed to ( albeit with some hiccups along the way ) deliver insanely promising rocket technology, all under Elon Musk's exciting vision that make us giddy at the thought of interplanetary travel. Virgin Galactic also came forth with some interesting designs, and is gearing up for a full on arms race to consumer space travel.

Finally, November brought us the successor to the the iconic Hubble Telescope and it was a behemoth . The James Webb has several times the optical capability of its younger brother, and the sheer promise of such a space telescope continues to excite NASA.

It's clear that in only twelve months we've been able to see so much of what lies beyond us. For those of you that are wondering why this is important, let's refer to Carl Sagan:

""The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.""

Clear, and with an eloquence I can only dream of, Sagan underscores the importance of astronomy. The parochial lens of our world limits us greatly, and what better way to understand our foibles and wrongdoings than to explore the sheer vastness beyond.

"
2442454042,"CAPE CANAVERAL - Culminating years of construction and testing, a $1.2 billion satellite designed to spot and track enemy missiles threatening the United States homeland, its deployed military forces abroad or allied nations will ascend to a surveillance post in space Thursday.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket will boost the third Space Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit satellite, or SBIRS GEO Flight 3, to orbit from Cape Canaveral during a 40-minute window opening at 7:46 p.m. EST (0046 GMT).

Kicking off another year, ULA plans at least 11 national security and science-enabling launches from the Cape and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California during 2017.

And it all begins by launching a satellite to support one the U.S. military's most critical missions - providing early warning of impending missile attacks.

""This is a prime, important national security space launch and will continue the ability to do 24/7 missile warning for the nation and our allies,"" said Col. Dennis Bythewood, director of the Remote Sensing Systems Directorate at the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center.

SBIRS evolves the orbital monitoring system from the Cold War focus on intercontinental ballistic missiles to today's short-range missile threats by incorporating new technologies to make quicker detections of fainter objects.

Spacecraft continuously monitor the globe to alert the national leadership and battlefield commanders of missile launches. The legacy Defense Support Program satellites have been joined by dedicated SBIRS birds in geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles over the equator and SBIRS infrared sensors hosted aboard classified spy satellites in highly elliptical, highly inclined orbits observe the top of the world.

""When the system was originally designed in a Cold War era, we were really worried about the Soviet Union and its allies (with) a relatively narrow profile of missiles and where we were looking at them coming from. In today's world, certainly over the last 20 years, the proliferation of missiles outside that concentrated area has grown demonstrably,"" Bythewood said.

""Regional systems present in Asia and the Middle East are well within the range of our deployed forces that we've seen over the last years of combat operations. The SBIRS constellation is tasked with providing timely, reliable accurate missile warning information to protect our nation and our troops operating abroad.""

The first SBIRS GEO satellite was launched in May 2011 and the second went up in March 2013, both aboard Atlas 5 rockets from Cape Canaveral. They currently cover the globe from the eastern Atlantic, across Europe, through the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula and all the way to the western Pacific.

The Air Force won't identify exactly where this new satellite will be positioned, saying only that GEO 3 further expands the amount of globe covered with SBIRS-quality surveillance.

""The addition of GEO 3 adds to the GEO 1 and 2 capability and provides a wider area of the Earth that we get that higher sensitivity to detect dimmer and shorter burning missiles,"" Bythewood said.

""The delivery of GEO 4 and the launch of that (satellite) at the end of this year will finalize the baseline SBIRS program and put worldwide SBIRS capability on orbit.""

DSP have only windshield wiper-type scanning sensors, while the advanced SBIRS GEO spacecraft are equipped with both scanning and also staring instruments that can focus on specific target areas to increase the amount of reconnaissance that can be collected.

""The scanning sensor provides a wide-area surveillance of missile launches and natural phenomena across the Earth, while the staring sensor observes smaller areas of interest with superior sensitivity,"" said Dave Sheridan, Lockheed Martin's SBIRS program manager.

SBIRS data tightens the U.S. military's OODA loop - Observe, Orient, Decide and Act. It allows leaders to make decisions and take actions faster.

""The capability of the satellites we are launching now basically cuts in half the amount of time it takes for the satellite find and fix a missile launch on the face of the Earth and feed that into our missile warning network,"" Bythewood said.

""What SBIRS brings in capability beyond the Defense Support Program is the ability to find dimmer targets with shorter burn times, and those are representative of the tactical missile threats that we see in Asia and the Middle East today. That (data) provides both where they were launched from and predictions of where they will impact, which allows our troops in harm's way to take the appropriate action to spare life and limb.""

Approximately 8,000 infrared events are detected and addressed each year, including roughly 200 missile launches, according to the Air Force's SBIRS ground controllers.

And according to U.S. government intelligence, proliferation of ballistic missile systems, using advanced liquid- or solid-propellant propulsion technologies, are becoming more mobile, survivable, reliable, accurate and capable of striking targets over longer distances, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency says.

""Over the last five years, the Missile Defense Agency has seen an increase of about 1,200 additional ballistic missiles, with 5,900 outside NATO, Russia and China, and hundreds of launchers and missiles are currently in range of our deployed forces,"" Bythewood said.

""Those trends we expect to continue, and the stress that puts on our mission area to provide timely and accurate missile warning data will grow as we move forward.

""We address that in two ways: The inherent capability of the SBIRS sensors to detect those dimmer and shorter burning targets and the ongoing work within our technical intelligence side to understand what missiles are out there and what we need to do to detect them. That's work for software algorithms that allows us to pull data out of the infrared information that SBIRS deleivers and deliver that as actual missile warning, which means I know where the missile came from and I know where it's going. That's a continuous effort that we do every day.""

Weighing about 10,000 pounds at launch, the GEO Flight 3 satellite will be injected by the Atlas 5 into a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit with a high point of 22,237 statute miles, low point of 115 miles and inclination of 23.29 degrees to the equator. Separation of the spacecraft from the rocket occurs about 43 minutes after liftoff.

From there, controllers will spend about 9 days performing 6 firings of the craft's main engine to circularize the orbit before deploying the appendages and commencing the testing campaign.

Built around Lockheed Martin's commercial A2100 satellite platform, with a 12-year design life, the craft is a clone of the GEO 1 and 2. Their structures are made of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, and the birds are equipped with RH-32 radiation-hardened single board computers with reloadable flight software.

""The GEO Flight 3 sensor suite was developed by Northrop Grumman and produced at their factory in Azusa, California, and then delivered to Lockheed Martin in Sunnyvale for integration with our spacecraft in September 2014,"" Bythewood said.

After deploying its pair of electricity-producing solar arrays for 2,800 watts of power, GEO 3 will have a wing span of 49 feet. The craft also extends a light shade for the payload and unfolds gimbaled communications antennas for secure, spot beam transmissions.

Its scanner and starer instruments, amounting to 1,000 pounds of hardware, have highly agile pointing mirrors and dual infrared sensors that feature short wave, mid wave and see-to-ground spectral band assemblies.

""The GEO Flight 3 satellite is a functional equivalent of the on-orbit GEO satellites with minor design differences to account for parts and material obsolescence,"" said Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, Space and Missile Systems Center commander and program executive officer for Space.

This will be the 69th Atlas 5 rocket flight, the 34th to fly in the basic 401-configuration with no solid boosters and the 26th for the U.S. military.

""SBIRS is considered one of the nation's highest priority space programs, and we are honored to serve as the launch provider of this very important mission,"" said Bob Winn, United Launch Alliance's Air Force program manager.

Preview of 2017 plans

United Launch Alliance has four missions for the U.S. military, four for the National Reconnaissance Office, two for NASA and a commercial cargo run to the International Space Station scheduled in 2017.

Seven flights will originate at Cape Canaveral and four will go from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Atlas 5 has eight flights slated, while the Delta 4 has two and the penultimate Delta 2 is planned.

Following the SBIRS launch, another national security mission will occur from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The Atlas 5 will boost the NROL-79 spy satellite payload into orbit in February.

March has the Delta 4 launching the Air Force's ninth Wideband Global SATCOM communications satellite, a craft built with funding from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and New Zealand in an international partnership to share capacity of the constellation. And the OA-7 Cygnus resupply ship, operated by Orbital ATK, will head for the space station atop an Atlas 5.

June features another Atlas 5 from Vandenberg launching the classified NROL-42 payload and a Cape deployment of the Air Force's highly-secure Advanced Extra High Frequency 4 communications satellite by Atlas.

Two Cape launches of Atlas 5s in August will carry NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite-M and the secretive NROL-52 bird.

September tentatively has scheduled the next-to-last Delta 2 rocket with the civilian polar-orbiting JPSS 1 weather and climate satellite for NASA and NOAA from Vandenberg.

October will see a Delta 4 fly from Vandenberg to put up the NROL-47 surveillance craft, and the fourth SBIRS GEO satellite launch atop an Atlas 5 from the Cape is slated for November.

The Atlas 5 also has a few available slots that could be filled on short notice by commercial customers through ULA's RapidLaunch and RocketBuilder initiatives."
2442468530,"@Colum3 That is up to NASA, USAF, ULA, SpaceX, etc. Many factors decide launch dates and they are always subject to change."
2442479734,"@ikirigin Tesla, SpaceX. Do datacenters count?"
2442486784,"Well, SpaceX got a big boost of confidence today with a successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket. Back in September one of its rockets went up in flames on a Florida launch pad. But it was a picture-perfect liftoff today at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Carter Evans is at SpaceX headquarters.

(Begin VT)

MAN: Three, two, one.

CARTER EVANS: The launch of a Falcon 9 today was not just a success for SpaceX, which also safely landed the reusable rocket.

(Crowd cheering)

CARTER EVANS: It was the beginning of a delicate dance in orbit that could change communications back on Earth.

MATT DESCH: We need to get these satellites in the space.

CARTER EVANS: Matt Desch is CEO of Iridium.

MATT DESCH: We operate the world`s largest satellite constellation, supply and service to remote locations. And anywhere really there isn`t cell phone service.

CARTER EVANS: The rocket was carrying ten Iridium satellites, each about the size of a small car.

MATT DESCH: Everybody kind of gets to focus on the excitement of the rocket launch, but to me, it`s sixty minutes into the flight when my satellites start coming off of the dispenser. That`s when I can breathe easy.

CARTER EVANS: The plan went off without a hitch. SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell:

GWYNNE SHOTWELL: We have six more launches after this with ten satellites each. So we`ll basically be putting those seventy satellites into orbit, and that will form a network.

CARTER EVANS: Overdue replacement satellites that will not only increase phone coverage around the world, they`ll also track every airplane in real time anywhere on the planet, technology Iridium believes would not be feasible without SpaceX.

MATT DESCH: They`ve made it possible for a lot of satellite operators like us to-- to be able to even consider being in space. So it`s critical that they be successful, really for the sake of the whole space industry.

(End VT)

CARTER EVANS: Iridium plans to have all of its new satellites operational sometime next year. But, Reena, SpaceX has its sights set much further, with plans to put a human on Mars sometime in the next ten years.

2442486796,"REENA NINAN: Slip sliding away. A deadly ice storm slams the Heartland. Millions are in the path of dangerous weather. National Guard troops are deployed to help stranded drivers.

Also tonight, six days before his inauguration, President-Elect Donald Trump fires back at the civil rights hero who called him an illegitimate President.

A girl stolen at birth is reunited with her family eighteen years later.

VELMA AIKEN: I thank God today. I thank God today.

REENA NINAN: And four months after a rocket disaster, today a successful launch for SpaceX, beginning a mission that could change communication back on Earth.

ANNOUNCER: This is the CBS WEEKEND NEWS.

REENA NINAN: Good evening. I`m Reena Ninan.

We begin with a deadly ice storm sweeping across the central U.S. At least three people have been killed on slippery roads in Missouri and Oklahoma. Tonight, the severe weather is moving East, with nearly fifty million Americans under winter storm watches and warnings. Tony Dokoupil has the latest.

(Begin VT)

MAN #1 (internet video): Oh, there goes another one right there.

MAN #2 (internet video): Right there.

MAN #1 (internet video): Oh, he`s over-- he rolled over.

MAN #2 (internet video): Oh, he rolled over. He rolled over. Oh, my gosh.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Freezing rain turned Interstate 40 into a sheet of ice in Oklahoma on Friday, sending cars and trucks careening off the road. Some drivers opted to wait for a thaw.

MAN #3: Better safe than sorry. The same way you leave home is the same way, you know, you kind of want to make it back.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin and Missouri Governor Eric Greitens declared states of emergency. And in neighboring Kansas, the National Guard mobilized to help stranded drivers. Across the central U.S., thousands lost power and hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed. Road crews rushed to remove a glaze of ice that covered cars--

MAN #4: It looks like I have a window of ice.

TONY DOKOUPIL: --toppled trees and hung from road signs. The NFL time- shifted Sunday`s playoff game in Kansas City, Missouri, giving the Chiefs and Steelers a Sunday night kickoff to avoid the storm. In Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback warned of a long weekend.

SAM BROWNBACK: Make sure all your electronic devices are charged.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Emergency workers responded to a pair of multi-car pileups overnight in Wichita.

MAN #5: Well, then a car next to me panics. They hit their brakes hard and they sideswiped me and then I started spinning.

TONY DOKOUPIL: And a reminder to slowdown on treacherous roads. This snowplow driver in Utah is still recovering after a passing tractor-trailer forced him down a three hundred-foot embankment.

(End VT)

TONY DOKOUPIL: And here in New York, about an inch of snow could accumulate overnight. And that larger ice storm system could cause problems as far east as the Baltimore and Philadelphia areas. Reena.

REENA NINAN: We see it coming down there, Tony. Thank you very much.

2442508291,"Check out more imagery of Saturday's liftoff of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, including pictures from remote cameras at the launch pad and new video released by the U.S. Air Force.

The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) rocket soared into orbit from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base, heading off with 10 Iridium voice and data relay satellites at 9:54:39 a.m. PST (12:54:39 p.m. EST; 1754:39 GMT).

The on-target launch was the first by SpaceX since a rocket exploded on the launch pad in Florida on Sept. 1."
2442552404,"KELLY O`DONNELL (NBC News Capitol Hill Correspondent): Good morning, Willie. And as the Trump team is trying to deal with that, they`re telling us a new little detail about the inauguration that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas will administer the oath of office to the next Vice President Mike Pence and he will use the Reagan Bible. That is new. But guess who won`t see that? A Congressman like John Lewis and about a dozen other Democratic lawmakers who say they will boycott the inauguration. And this comes as Donald Trump is not taking the advice to back off some of his critics.

(Begin VT)

KELLY O`DONNELL: The self-described counter-puncher-in-chief--

DONALD TRUMP: I`m a counter-puncher, you understand that.

KELLY O`DONNELL: --stepped up for another round in a verbal tussle.

REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS: I don`t plan to attend inauguration.

KELLY O`DONNELL: Striking first was Georgia Congressman John Lewis, beloved by Democrats, admired beyond party as a civil rights era legend, who said Russian hacking makes Trump`s election invalid.

REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS: I don`t see this President-elect as a legitimate president.

KELLY O`DONNELL: Saturday evening after a wave of social media urged Trump to back off tweeting at Lewis, he instead threw a fresh punch. ""Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner- cities of the U.S.,"" but with a twist, ""I can use all the help I can get."" Minutes later, a Michigan Republican Congressman pleaded with the President-elect. ""Dude, just stop."" Democrats quickly spun Trump`s slights toward Lewis into fund-raising gold with e-mail appeal. Demonstrators seized on this holiday that remembers Martin Luther king Junior to send their message demanding social justice to the new Trump administration. Doctor King`s son says Trump must make good on his campaign promises.

MARTIN LUTHER KING III (Human Rights Leader): He said that he wanted to create the condition to elevate the quality of life in communities of color. Then we need to hold his feet to the fire.

KELLY O`DONNELL: Organized anger toward Trump threatens to sour his inaugural celebration. That pressure pushed out Broadway star, dream girl Jennifer Holliday, who is now telling you she`s not going--

(Jennifer Holliday singing)

KELLY O`DONNELL: --after the Trump inaugural committee, which has struggled to book headliners, had announced her performance for a welcome concert at the Lincoln Memorial.

(End VT)

KELLY O`DONNELL: And Jennifer Holliday wrote an open letter to fans saying that she apologized for her lapse in judgment, not realizing that many of her fans, especially those in the LGBT community, did not want to see someone that they revere appearing at anything related to the inauguration committee. She said she did not expect that backlash and decided it was best under those circumstances to support her fans and to pull out of that ceremony the night before the inauguration. Willie.

WILLIE GEIST: All right. Kelly O`Donnell at Trump Tower for us this morning. Kelly, thanks.

Chuck Todd is NBC`s political director and, of course, the moderator of MEET THE PRESS. Chuck, good morning. The news of your interview with John Lewis, which will air in its entirety in just a little bit on MEET THE PRESS, hit on Friday like a thunderbolt. When you have someone of John Lewis`s respect, of his authority saying that this is not a legitimate President, what is the impact of that?

CHUCK TODD (Moderator of MEET THE PRESS/NBC News Political Director): Look, I think the impact is going to be, number one, I think it is going to give a permission slip to maybe a lot of Democrats who wanted to say it but didn`t feel comfortable saying it to say it. That`s number one. And that is-- that is going to-- that could divide the Democratic Party. You know, some Democrats came out early on Friday and respectfully disagreed with John Lewis. I think David Axelrod was one of them, noting that he thought it was bad when there was legitimacy questions thrown at-- at President Obama. But Donald Trump`s decision to attack and to essentially react the way he does-- way he did seemed to unify the Democrats now in a way that maybe they wouldn`t have been as unified. They have been sort of wrestling with how to handle this. Well, there`s no wrestling anymore and instead I think Donald Trump bought himself some problems with Republicans.

WILLIE GEIST: Well, you know, it`s interesting because we`ve learned from Donald Trump that no criticism can go unanswered.

CHUCK TODD: Right.

WILLIE GEIST: Look at John McCain, you look at the Gold Star family and the Khans, whoever it is, it doesn`t matter who you are, he`s going to hit back at you. Is this time different now, though, because of who John Lewis is, number one and number two, because this is not a campaign anymore, this is the man who`s going to be--

CHUCK TODD: Right.

WILLIE GEIST: --President in five days?

CHUCK TODD: No, I think that`s right, and-- and it-- it reminds me more of- - of what happened to the Khan family and that controversy that surrounded that where you basically-- and if you noticed yesterday, there was silence among many Republicans not wanting to get involved, not wanting to say anything. Those that did, did so respectfully of Lewis more than respectfully of Trump. So I-- I feel like we-- if you`re looking for have we seen this before, we did, after both McCain and the Khan-- and the Khan episode. I-- I guess that-- that this is five days before the inauguration. I mean, and if you throw this in, you know, this does create a situation where from-- as an outsider, you look at this, Willie, and you say our political situation just appears unstable. If this were taking place in another country, our State Department would be, you know, briefing the President to say, hey, you know, country X over here as a really unstable leadership situation during their transition of power. This is the United States, and right now we have-- half-- perhaps half of one political party in one place, you`ve got Donald Trump at war with the intel community, you`ve got this issue with press freedoms being questioned by Donald Trump, it`s the administration, so it is a very, very--I`m sorry--odd situation to be in five days before an inauguration.

WILLIE GEIST: And for all those reasons you laid out were you surprised that John Lewis said what he said so publicly? Did you-- did it sound as you talked to him like he appreciated--

CHUCK TODD: Yeah.

WILLIE GEIST: --what he was saying and the impact it was going to have?

CHUCK TODD: Oh, he knew the impact. He knew-- look, I had no idea going in. I set this interview up a couple weeks ago to be honest, Willie. I thought it would be a poignant moment. I-- John Lewis` take on-- on the situ-- political situation here on Martin Luther King weekend, last Sunday of the Obama presidency. And then I just simply asked him a question about would he forge a relationship with Donald Trump the way he had with previous Presidents. And that is all I asked. And that`s the answer we got. He knew what he was doing and he just felt-- he-- he-- he put it in moral terms. Willie.

WILLIE GEIST: Setting us up for a crazy day on Friday at the inauguration, now twenty-some, probably that number will grow, as you say Democratic Congress people not going to be there.

CHUCK TODD: Right.

WILLIE GEIST: Artists pulling out, protests. It`s going to be a wild day on Friday. Chuck Todd, thanks so much. We`ll be watching you in addition to Congressman John Lewis. Chuck`s guests will include President-elect Trump`s Chief of Staff Ryan Priebus and Senator Dianne Feinstein, all ahead on MEET THE PRESS.

Now let`s take a quick look at some of the other stories this morning including the end of an era in entertainment. After one hundred forty-six years, the Ringling Brothers Circus will have its final curtain call in May. The decision comes after a dramatic decline in ticket sales, especially since elephants were phased out early last year amid costly battles with animal rights groups. The company`s final show will be on May 21st on New York`s Long Island.

The biological parents of a young woman adducted from a Jacksonville Florida hospital just hours after she was born eighteen years ago, have reunited with their child for the first time. Here`s the family`s first photo of the reunion Saturday in Walterboro, South Carolina, made possible by a DNA test. It took place in the town`s police department where the woman who raised Kamiyah, Gloria Williams, is currently in custody. The fifty-one-year-old is awaiting extradition to Florida to face kidnapping charges.

Mourners in Orlando will gather today to remember a sheriff`s deputy who died in the pursuit of a murder suspect earlier this week. On Saturday, thousands gathered to honor another brave member of law enforcement who died that day, Orlando police officer Debra Clayton. She was shot and killed by that same suspect when she confronted him outside a Walmart. The suspect is still at large.

Some new satellites are orbiting earth this morning, a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from California and launched them into orbit. It`s the first launch for SpaceX since a rocket blew up during testing last September.

The NFL divisional playoffs continue today with the Packers traveling to Texas to take on the Cowboys and the Steelers visiting the Chiefs. On Saturday, the New England Patriots led again by Tom Brady pulled away in the second half to beat the Houston Texans by a score of thirty-four to sixteen. Dion Lewis there was the star. Earlier the Atlanta Falcons beat the Seattle Seahawks thirty-six to twenty.

And you can catch that Steelers-Chiefs game tonight right here on NBC, coverage begins with Football Night in America at seven thirty Eastern.

And now Indra Petersons is helping us out while Dylan`s out on maternity leave has a look at that weather. Hey, Indra.

INDRA PETERSONS: Hey. It`s still very busy out there. Twenty-one million people still talking about these winter weather advisories. Eleven million of you still looking at ice storms warnings. Many of you haven`t even seen this in over five years and also many of these cities especially we get towards Oklahoma and Kansas into Missouri. St. Louis, Wichita, a lot of you are seeing more ice in this one ice storm than you`ve seen in the entire year. Typically, this is a huge storm. Very crippling here. Power lines coming down. Just take a look at the effects we`re in, looking at that bull`s eye here and that exact same region especially as we go through the next several days. We`re going to continue to see that stationary front. So reason we call it stationary, right, we`re still looking at that ice storm. It`ll be with us until we get through Monday.

That`s a look at the big picture. Here`s a look at your local weather.

(Weather follows)

INDRA PETERSONS: So now we know exactly why we call it a stationary front. We`ve been talking about this for days. Icing is still there and you`re just talking about the Chiefs game. Yeah, had to make it later because of we`re still having icing.

WILLIE GEIST: That`s going to be wild tonight. Indra, thanks.

Stick around for the highs and lows of the week including the surprise parting gift that brought Vice President Biden to tears this week.

And the five brothers and sisters in their eighties and nineties moving back in together after all these years.

Plus, the revelation about an illegal club drug that could change the way doctors treat posttraumatic stress disorder. It`s all coming up on SUNDAY TODAY.

 HIGHLIGHT: 
 The National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine looked at all of what they think is valid research on marijuana going back to 1999. Here are just a few of the important conclusions.

JOSE DIAZ-BALART (00:20:57): Marijuana is now legal in twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C., for either recreation or medical use, and legal sales are now in the billions each year. With that in mind, a new report out this week highlights how little we still know about the drug. Harry Smith tonight on the growing questions.

(Begin VT)

HARRY SMITH (00:21:15): Marijuana, a harmless intoxicant or a dangerous drug? We asked some people in Denver this week why they use it.

MAN #1 (00:21:22): Calms anxiety.

MAN #2 (00:21:23): To help me sleep at night.

WOMAN (00:21:25): I actually have pretty severe arthritis in my hips and knees, and I`ve been using it for eight years to help me with that.

HARRY SMITH (00:21:31): The National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine looked at all of what they think is valid research on marijuana going back to 1999. Here are just a few of the important conclusions. First, on the negative side. Marijuana and driving: an increased risk of crashes. Marijuana and pregnancy: it can lower your baby`s birth weight. Marijuana and mental illness: it can trigger psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia. On the positive side, marijuana, they found, is effective in treating chronic pain; marijuana can increase appetite during chemotherapy; and marijuana is helpful with pain and muscle spasms for people with MS. But there`s plenty more scientists don`t know. The research simply hasn`t been done.

DR. MARIE MCCORMICK (Harvard T.H. Chan school of Public Health) (00:22:17): We could find so little evidence for so many of the questions that we wanted to address. The studies were either not there or they were very weak.

HARRY SMITH (00:22:27): The deterrent: marijuana is still a schedule I drug. Research is highly restricted. How restricted?

DR. MARIE MCCORMICK (00:22:34): There`s only one university that produces research-grade mari-- marijuana, and that`s the University of Mississippi.

HARRY SMITH (00:22): And a DEA that maintains marijuana is as dangerous as cocaine or heroin, which makes research really tough.

DR. MARIE MCCORMICK (00:22:49): We are way behind in terms of where we ought to be to deal with public health issues and the individual health issues that will be raised by the wider access to these products.

HARRY SMITH (00:23:00): Sixty percent of Americans think marijuana should be legalized. It might be nice to know a little more about it.

(00:23:07): Harry Smith, NBC News, New York.

(End VT)

JOSE DIAZ-BALART (00:23:09): And a key moment today for this country`s commercial space business. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket, this time successfully. The rocket took ten communication satellites to orbit. The first stage of it successfully landed in a barge on the Pacific. In September, a similar rocket, you may remember, exploded on a launch pad in Florida. About seventy launches worth more than ten billion dollars are planned.

(00:23:34): Up next, a whale of a tale you will not want to miss.

2442975887,"NASA's commercial program holds much promise-the development of private vehicles to transport humans into low Earth orbit should eventually bring down spaceflight costs and broaden access to space. But as is often the case with new spacecraft development, both Boeing and SpaceX have faced technical problems with their capsules.

Publicly, NASA has maintained the hope that at least one private vehicle, either Boeing's Starliner or SpaceX's Crew Dragon, would be capable of operational missions by the end of 2017 or early 2018. But that no longer appears certain-or even likely. Meanwhile, NASA still has the International Space Station to maintain and must get its astronauts there through the only means possible. Back in 2015, anticipating delays with the commercial crew program, NASA purchased transport on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft through 2018. But that may not be long enough, the agency has decided.

Seats for 2019

Last September, based upon anonymous sources, Ars reported that NASA had begun considering buying additional seats in 2019 as a hedge against further delays with the commercial crew program. Both NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and the agency's head of human spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier, subsequently denied this report.
These dismissive comments notwithstanding, a new solicitation filed by NASA on Tuesday reveals that the agency is indeed seeking to purchase Soyuz seats for 2019 (NASA will negotiate with Boeing for these additional seats, which Boeing received from Russia's Energia as compensation for the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Sea Launch joint venture). The solicitation seeks an option to buy three additional Soyuz seats in 2019 ""as a primary or backup transportation capability to ensure proper launch cadence with no gaps in crew rotation transportation.""

The solicitation comes just three days before Bolden, a champion of the commercial crew program who has sparred with Congress over funding, leaves office. It seems likely the notification is timed such that there still is time for Russia to build additional Soyuz launch capacity for 2019, while also allowing the current NASA leadership to bypass this politically sensitive issue before leaving office on January 20 when Donald Trump is inaugurated.

Undoubtedly, Congress will not be positively predisposed to funding requests for additional Russian seats, especially because the price keeps going up. Since the decision to retire the space shuttle in 2009, the Russian price for a seat has skyrocketed from about $30 million for a trip into orbit to $81.9 million for each of the six seats NASA bought for 2018. It seems likely the price for any seats in 2019 would increase substantially, especially because NASA would be providing less than the three years of lead time as is customary for such orders.

More seats in 2017 and 2018

The new NASA request also seeks an additional two seats in 2017 and 2018. This is possible because Russia will scale back its presence on the space station for the next couple of years, from three crew per six months to two, as it seeks to pare expenses. By reducing the number of its crew members, Russia will need to fly fewer Progress cargo ships, which deliver food and supplies to the Russian side of the station.

This Russian decision will make room for one crew member in the fall of 2017 as well as the spring of 2018, and NASA would like to buy those two rides into space, as well, to increase crew time for science research on board the station. ""The purchase of these services in 2017 and 2018 will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four crew members to maximize ISS science utilization,"" the NASA solicitation states. ""Maximizing science utilization of the ISS is a program priority.""

The additional seats for NASA and US partners would not kick in until September of this year, meaning that Fyodor Yurchikhin and Jack Fischer will still fly as a crew of two in March."

The commercialization of space stripped Brevard County of our monopoly on space. Here we are, less than 10 years later, and everyone is looking at shooting for the stars. There is even a spaceport in Kodiak, Alaska, planning commercial space launches. Where will we be in 2030 if we don't make some big changes here in Florida? It might be a good idea to trademark that ""Space Coast"" nickname.

Reed 'in tune' with Brevard

Matt Reed will be sorely missed at FLORIDA TODAY. He is always in tune to our community and his work on the corruption bill was an amazing feat. It may be Matt's time to move on to newer adventures but his shoes will be hard to fill.

A letter to GOP officials

Dear Sens. Lott and Dole:

Your Republican party is dead. Your party obstructed a sitting president in an unprecedented and partisan manner from the 20th of January 2009 through the 20th of January 2017. Merrick Garland should have been confirmed. Dozens of judgeships have been left languishing. Potential collusion between certain members of the president-elect team and foreign clandestine operatives alone should disqualify the man about to take the oath - an oath he will scoff at and look for every avenue to break without being caught. How do we know this? Dozens of contracts made and broken by this man with the use of threats, bullying and lies; this man who spent years trying to discredit the very citizenship of a sitting president.

The Democrats should filibuster every unqualified nominee, starting with Jeff Sessions and Ben Carson.

'Mean season' needs to end

Is anyone else tired of this mean season? The negativity that is palpable from the TV news to the paper to magazines is so adversarial that the president-elect has to fight to get the unslanted truth out.

Two months have passed since the election and some people have forgotten that Donald Trump was duly elected by a lawful democratic process. What is driving these rumors and negative characterizations of Mr. Trump? So punitive and disrespectful is the elitist attitude of the news media. They are printing and saying anything against Trump that they can get their hands on and by doing so are diminishing our president in the eyes of the world.

It is easy to talk about people, throwing mud at those in power, but it's a real shame when the target is the leader-elect of our country and for the world. The Fourth Estate wants to push fake news, lies and innuendo by the very people who are supposed to seek, verify and safeguard the truth. At the end of last year, a little grade-school child said very brightly in her New Year's wish for adults, ""Don't be mean in '17."" Her saying has gone viral.

Denying contraceptives to control

Senators in Washington recently voted down coverage for contraceptives in the middle of the night, demonstrating a real piece of brave brilliance trying to control women in our society.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, about 99 percent of American women sexually active (ages 15 to 44) use contraceptives. The age group at greatest risk, because of lack of birth control measures, are 15- to 19-year-olds: Only 62 percent in this demographic utilize birth control measures. Taking away this coverage through insurance and Planned Parenthood not only leaves this age group highly vulnerable, but increases the chances of poor women having unplanned pregnancies as well.

Are we really this petty as a society?

American leaders on Russia: hypocrites?

It seems funny to me that President Obama, John McCain and so may other American leaders are so outraged over Russian interference in our election. Put aside the fact for the moment that very likely they did not. I wonder if any of our leaders who express moral outrage over such acts ever give a thought to the number of countries whose elections we have tampered with, whose elected governments we have overthrown because we did not like them, and the network of tyrants we have enabled throughout large parts of the world since World War II.

From the Shah of Iran to Pinochet in Chile, these American puppets have been catastrophic for the people forced to live under their rule. When I hear John McCain and Lindsay Graham self-righteously condemning Russia for their acts in Crimea and Georgia, I can't help but think of Vietnam and Iraq to name just two of our larger full- scale invasions of other nations who did not attack us.

American leaders display a stunning level of hypocrisy and have a terrible habit of condemning behavior in other countries while endorsing the same behavior times 10 by our own. Maybe it's time our leaders adjust their own moral compass before worrying about everyone else's."
2443084524,"[05:00:11] GEORGE HOWELL, CNN ANCHOR: The president-elect of the United States versus a civil rights icon. Congressman John Lewis feels the backlash after Donald Trump -- saying that Donald Trump is not a legitimate president.

Some 70 countries from around the world together for a peace conference in Paris on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but guess who's not there? The Israelis and Palestinians. We'll have a live report on that issue.

And the greatest show on earth. America's legendary Ringling Brothers Circus is taking down its tent after almost 150 years.

Live from CNN world headquarters in Atlanta, welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm George Howell. CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.

The U.S. president-elect is firing back against a civil rights icon. On Friday Congressman John Lewis said he didn't see Trump as, quote, ""a legitimate president."" Lewis, an ally of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the early days of the Civil Rights Movement, found himself the subject of Trump's Twitter wrath just days before the U.S. holiday commemorating Dr. King.

Here's how it all got started with Lewis' comments to NBC. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), GEORGIA: I don't see the president-elect as a legitimate president.

CHUCK TODD, MSNBC'S ""MEET THE PRESS"": You do not consider him a legitimate president. Why is that?

LEWIS: I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and to help destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOWELL: Trump on Twitter firing back, quote, ""Congressman Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart, not to mention crime infested, rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk, no actions or results. Sad.""

Trump later seemed to double down on that criticism, quote, ""Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner cities of the United States. I can use all the help that I can get.""

Here's what some residents of John Lewis's district here in the city of Atlanta, Georgia, had to say about this feud.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To tear down John Lewis is definitely detrimental to his cause and it's not going to play very well with African- Americans.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump's the president. I got over when Obama went in. Half the world needs to get over now for Trump.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOWELL: Let's bring in CNN Politics reporter Eugene Scott live for us in Washington, D.C. via Skype.

Eugene, a pleasure to have you with us. I'd like to start by breaking this down into its different parts. First from the big picture point of view, Donald Trump attacking a civil rights icon saying that he is all talk, no action. This despite Lewis' deep history in civil rights, not to mention the fact that just last June Lewis arranged a sit-in right here, you see the video, the sit-in on the topic of gun control. So the issue of Lewis' service that is being attacked, what has been the response here? Is there a feeling that the president- elect may have gone too far?

EUGENE SCOTT, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: There is certainly a feeling that Donald Trump is actually not familiar with John Lewis' record in Congress. And so one approach to that we have seen on social media is people tweeting out some of the causes and policy proposals that the representative has put forward in his 30-plus year career in Congress.

HOWELL: OK. Here we are just days before the inauguration, there's a growing list, Eugene, of Democrats who say they have no plans of even attending the inauguration. Take a look here, you can see that we have the breakdown of the many different Democrats who say, hey, they plan to skip it.

Also, I want you to look at this image, it shows Trump's pre-inaugural approval ratings. And it is the lowest compared to other presidents. You see Donald Trump there at 44 percent compared to President Obama, Bush and Clinton, much higher.

Here's the question, Eugene. What does this say about Donald Trump's ability to build bridges across the aisle before he even takes the oath of office?

SCOTT: Well, it brings into question his ability to do so. The list of Democratic lawmakers boycotting the inauguration continues to grow. The number is actually closer to 20 now, and that's on top of the Women's March that's expected to attract more than 200,000 Americans. There's concern also that perhaps Donald Trump isn't really interested in working with some of these people because if you look at the heart of John Lewis' critique, it wasn't about Donald Trump specifically as much as Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

[05:05:07] And many Democratic lawmakers who even do think that Donald Trump's election was legitimate would like to see the president-elect be more aggressive in addressing that issue.

HOWELL: Eugene, this latest controversy, you know, it all started after Lewis said that he did not believe Trump to be a legitimate president. Still this topic, though, of legitimacy came up during the Obama's presidency. My colleague Poppy Harlow touched on that earlier in her show. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BEN FERGUSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I also think it's unprecedented that a congressman with his stature was able to come out and say, I don't believe Donald Trump is a legitimate president. I cannot imagine the fallout, the backfire that you would have if a Republican would ever imply that about Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK or anyone else for that matter. That is --

POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Ben, Ben, Ben. Ben, that's exactly what many Republicans did.

SYMONE SANDERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Many Republicans did, Ben.

HARLOW: Including the president-elect for years, questioning the legitimacy of the first black president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOWELL: The conservative commentator there Ben Ferguson making the point. And Poppy Harlow fact-checking making the counterpoint that in fact that did indeed happen with the president-elect focusing on the birther issue, an issue that has been proven to be patently false.

SCOTT: Yes, it is true that Donald Trump, some say built his career, his political career on questioning President Barack Obama's legitimacy despite having documentations showing that the current president very much had reason and the right to be president. Whether or not Donald Trump will move forward in accepting the intelligence that his critics are hoping he will, that will no longer bring his legitimacy into question for people like John Lewis and his supporters, it's not yet clear, but he has proposed to put forward a committee that will look into more hacking of foreign governments in the future.

HOWELL: And Eugene, also as a matter of fact because facts do matter Trump called Lewis' district crime-ridden, that district which his the city of Atlanta for the most part, and I have to say, I live here. No one can deny that there is crime in the city, but to try to define an entire city or district in 140 characters or less is a massive overgeneralization at best. In fact, Atlanta has many things going for it. I'll post some things on Twitter today, those facts that have been proven, but the question comes down to this. Trump's style whether it's focusing on people or companies, what happens when he takes office doing these kinds of things online?

SCOTT: Well, one of the things that's going to continue is what we saw yesterday. And people will continue to push back with facts. People have flooded social media describing Metropolitan Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs with the accuracy that was not reflected in Donald Trump's tweets. Furthermore, we will see people also pushing back on claims he's made that can be supported by stories and news and research.

And one of those examples is Donald Trump allegedly will be visiting the Smithsonian Museum tomorrow in commemoration of Martin Luther King Day. John Lewis is the representative who introduced the bill for that museum to be built.

HOWELL: Eugene Scott live for us in Washington. Eugene, thank you.

Civil rights activists who are concerned about the Trump administration plan to make it known that they intend to stand up to the president-elect before he's sworn in. This is the scene in Washington despite the rainy weather. Some 2,000 people marched Saturday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The protest organizer Reverend Al Sharpton says Democrats in Congress need to, quote, ""get some backbone.""

In a separate rally at a Washington church, they vow to fight for immigration rights. Organizers say they are against the targeting of Muslims and fear the deportation of millions of immigrants.

Civil rights activists also tell us that they will continue to watch what happens with the Trump administration. The president-elect is also looking to see U.S. sanctions lifted when it comes to Russia. This is something that he has been talking about. He's indicated that it's up to Moscow for this to happen and he says that he will be fine with meeting with the Russian president Vladimir Putin if indeed, you know, after he takes office is necessary.

A story we continue to follow as well. CNN's Matthew Chance is following that story.

And Matthew, I do want to ask you, what is the perception there in Russia given the fact that the president-elect is making it clear he's willing to meet with Vladimir Putin?

MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, I think that's being welcomed obviously. I mean, if you talk to Russian officials about this, I mean, they say they are not looking for any special treatment by the White House, by President Donald Trump once he's sworn into office. But, you know, sort of behind the scenes, they're secretly, quietly confident that the situation is going to improve somewhat once Donald Trump is the president of the United States, particularly with the issue of sanctions. [05:10:13] There's a belief here in Russia that Donald Trump has a negative attitude towards sanctions as a policy towards Russia because that hasn't changed Russia's behavior. And of course he's been supported in that belief by his nomination for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he was the CEO of Exxon, went on the record to say that he did not believe that sanctions were an effective tool of American policy.

And so look, I think there's a quiet confidence, should we say, in the Kremlin. But once Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the very rocky relationship that is existent between Moscow and Washington is going to start to ease somewhat and get better.

HOWELL: At the same time, there have been a lot of mixed messages to say the least of Donald Trump indicating one thing, though congressional leaders indicating another saying that the U.S. should keep a stronger stance against Russia. Is there sort of a wait-and- see attitude there in Russia?

CHANCE: I think there's definitely that. I mean, the Russians are under no illusions about the unpredictability of Donald Trump, for instance. I mean, never mind the political situation he has to deal with himself in the Congress. And as you quite rightly say, there are significant voices calling for even stronger sanctions against Russia in the U.S. Congress. But Donald Trump himself is seen here in Moscow as being unpredictable. He's spoken about, yes, the possibility of recognizing Crimea as a legitimate part of Russia. Of course Russia annexed that territory from Ukraine in 2014.

He's criticized NATO. He's spoken about cooperation with the Russians in Syria to fight international terrorism. All of this is music to the Kremlin's ears. But at the same time, he's an unknown political quantity. And, you know, behind the scenes, there are serious doubts here in Russia, amongst Russian officials, that he will be able to follow through, be willing or able to follow through on any of those suggestions that he's made in the campaign and as he approaches this inauguration as president of the U.S.

HOWELL: Matthew Chance live for us in Moscow. Matthew, thank you for the reporting.

Still ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM, the first major foreign policy test of Donald Trump once he is in office. His administration invited to the next round of Syrian peace talks. We'll have details on that.

Plus France is hosting a peace conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Why this meeting is so controversial.

Live across the world this hour, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:15:18] HOWELL: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm George Howell.

The incoming Trump administration may soon have its first major test on foreign policy. Turkey and Russia have invited the United States to the next round of Syrian peace talks. The negotiations are scheduled just three days after Trump's inauguration. It's unclear if his administration will accept that invitation. Syria's umbrella opposition group, the High Negotiations Committee. That group now says it supports those talks.

For more on the story, let's bring in CNN's Muhammad Lila following the story in Abu Dhabi this hour.

Muhammad, good to have you with us. So the United States was not brokering -- not part of brokering this peace deal, but now it is invited to the table. What does this mean for the U.S. to be invited?

MUHAMMAD LILA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, George, talk about being thrown right into the deep-end for the new Trump administration. Look, at this point we don't know if the United States is going to accept this invitation and join these peace talks in Ashtana, Kazakhstan. Normally what would happen is that the State Department would make a recommendation for the president-elect once he's inaugurated and he becomes president. It would be up to him whether or not to accept that invitation based on the recommendation from the State Department.

But what makes this invite so interesting, George, is not the fact that the United States is being invited to the table but how they are being invited to the table. Make no mistake, this is not the United States being told that it will have a role in this Syrian peace process. It's specifically the Trump administration and the reason for that is simple. This has all been hammered out over the last several weeks by Russia and Turkey, two of the key players that have proxies and have very deep vested interest in the outcome of the Syrian war.

Those two sides have been hammering out how this peace process would play out. And throughout that entire period starting back in late November, the United States wasn't invited. President Obama didn't have a seat at the time, Secretary of State John Kerry didn't have a seat at the table. In fact the entire cease-fire was hammered out without any U.S. involvement. And lo and behold, three days after Trump is scheduled to take office, suddenly now the United States gets an invitation to be part of these long-term peace talks.

So clearly there's a strong preference from Turkey and Russia to have completely avoided the Obama administration and waited for the new president-elect to be inaugurated before the United States would be invited back to the table.

HOWELL: And as you point out no word yet on whether Trump or his team will attend. But if the U.S. attends, Muhammad, what's the plus-minus here? Will the U.S. be at a disadvantage going into this meeting?

LILA: Well, there's a big question about what kind of capital or currency the United States still has left in Syria. I mean, there was a point where the United States was considered a broker, it was considered a channel for the opposition to possibly talk with Turkey and Russia and to help set up some sort of peace process. The United States is quite frankly trying to do that in the past but it's completely failed.

The fact that Turkey and Russia now seem to be succeeding in maintaining this very fragile cease-fire so far is an indication of how far the U.S.'s influence has fallen in Syria and how important and key the players are now, which are Russia, Turkey and Iran. So even if the United States does get a seat at the table, its role is really up in the air. I mean, Turkey and Russia have guaranteed or have put themselves up as the guarantors of the cease-fire. So when there's a violation, people in Syria now look to Turkey and Russia to monitor it and to enforce it.

What role has the U.S. play in that? Well, the U.S. really hasn't played any role in that. So the question is when they are sitting at the negotiation table, is the United States going to be an observer or are they going to have a more active role. At least over the last several weeks are any indication, it may simply be in an observer role, but of course that's going to be up to the President-elect Donald Trump to decide what role the United States wants to have in Syria moving forward.

HOWELL: Invited three days after inauguration, it is a game of geopolitical chess. It will be interesting to see whether the U.S. accepts the invitation or not. How it will participate, how it could participate or not.

Muhammad Lila, live for us, thank you.

Around 70 countries are meeting in Paris for a peace conference on the Middle East. They hope to urge Israeli and Palestinian leaders to commit to a two-state solution. We'll have more on that conference in just a moment, but first a key issue that divides both sides, it is the city of Jerusalem. Both sides claim it as their capital.

Our Sara Sidner has this report for us.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The tapestry of Palestinian neighborhood in east Jerusalem is changing. More and more the Star of David is being woven into the landscape as Jewish settlers with the help of nonprofit organizations buy or sue their way in to Palestinian homes.

[05:20:09] It makes for a volatile situation. We watch as Jewish children walk to and from home noticing they are never without an armed escort. Their families' fear evident in the most mundane of acts. Fear is something they have in common with their Palestinian neighbors.

Zohair al-Rajabi (PH) says his own home surveillance video shows guns used to protect Jewish settlers are sometimes turned on Palestinians. Settlers say they simply respond to attacks by Palestinians.

""They're trying to scare the families with guns so we get to a point where we're convinced to take the money and leave."" Al-Rajabi, an activist and father, says that's what's happening to him and his family. ""In the beginning of 2014,"" he says, ""they started giving us evacuation orders claiming this land was owned by settlers since 1892."" In the legal battle, he says Jewish settlers cite articles written back when the Ottoman Empire ruled here, saying the land was once Jewish owned. A century later they want it back.

The Rajabi family lives in the Silwan neighborhood, jammed tightly into the hills of East Jerusalem. Silwan lies right outside the gates of the Old City which surrounds the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Wailing Wall.

But for al-Rajabi, this is simply home. And he's staying put, even after Jewish settlers offered him a blank check to sell it.

(On camera): Why not take the money and get out of here, run away?

(Voice-over): ""This question makes me laugh, it's not the money, it's about principles. We want our land, our house, our dignity,"" he says. Even though his children dread encounters with settlers who live a few doors down.

""They shot at us and arrested my brother. I was so scared,"" 7-year- old Darin (PH) said. Al-Rajabi's son says this encounter also caught on surveillance video shows violence he endured by settlers near his home.

(On camera): We tried to talk to some of Israeli settlers here in east Jerusalem. None of them would talk to us on camera. However, a young man named Niveh (PH) did speak.

(Voice-over): I asked him why anyone would choose to live in such a tense situation. He said, for some, it stems from a deep and abiding religious belief that all these land belong to the Jews and they will endure anything to make that so.

But settlements go against international law and are an impediment to a two-state solution where East Jerusalem is the capital of a future Palestinian state.

(On camera): Do you think you can ever live in peace?

(Voice-over): ""How will I forget how I suffer? How will I forget how they beat me? We can never live in peace,"" he says. Here even the next generation can't imagine a peaceful solution.

Sara Sidner, CNN, Jerusalem.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOWELL: But again there is a peace conference taking place in Paris on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Let's talk more about that with CNN's Oren Liebermann, following the story live for us in Jerusalem.

Oren, good to have you with us. Given that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are part of this actual meeting, can anything truly come from it? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the French Foreign minister said in sort of an introduction to the conference that they have to do something before all is lost here. And that they are not trying to impose a solution on the Israelis and the Palestinians, but there's a question of what will come out of this. At best will be a recommendation or a guideline that either side can ignore, can ignore whatever it doesn't like, because there's no consequence to ignoring it.

The idea is to keep the peace process moving forward, which has been stagnant ever since the last round of peace talks broke down in April 2014. Netanyahu in this morning's Cabinet meeting fired off another criticism of the peace conference saying it's a false conference and that it's a relic of the past and that a new day or a new era begins soon. He added very soon, perhaps there referencing President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration only a few days away here.

HOWELL: So whatever comes out of this meeting, Oren, could it put new pressure on the Israelis and Palestinians to find some sort of a new solution?

LIEBERMANN: On the zone that's unlikely because again there's no -- there's no consequence. Although this is some 70 countries meeting, this isn't the U.N. It's not the EU. There are no sanctions that will come out of this. But Israel's fears is what comes next. If these recommendations are then taken to the U.N. Security Council and adopted in another resolution, even if that resolution is non-binding, that's a big step forward. A big step that's virtually impossible to undo.

And whether Trump chooses to abide by that or not it doesn't matter because those recommendations aren't going away. They'll become a U.N. Security Council resolution. That remains Israel's great fear in the last few days of the Obama administration.

One thing that's worth pointing out is on this specific day, there's a group calling itself Commanders for the Security of Israel.

[05:25:03] They're not coming out and saying we need a two-state solution but they're opposing a one-state solution saying, if there isn't a Palestinian state soon, that it hurts Israel's democracy and it hurts Israel's security. That is a big statement especially on this day and that includes former heads of Mossad, former heads of the Shin Bet, which is the security service and very high-ranking officers in the military.

So they're trying to push forward, whether it's the peace conference itself or peace trying to make some sort of statement here to move forward exactly what the Congress itself is trying to move forward.

HOWELL: It is also important to point out, the United States certainly an important key in all of this. The Israeli leaders there frustrated with the Obama administration leaving the door open, hopeful for change in policy with the incoming Trump administration.

But, Oren, important to point out that no representatives from the incoming administration are taking part either in what is happening at Paris.

LIEBERMANN: Right. And Trump has made it clear that he didn't support this conference at all. Kerry will be there. Secretary of State John Kerry will be there at the conference and I think he's expected to make a speech. And again that gets that why this conference may have no immediate effect on its own. What's important is that this conference doesn't stand on its own. From Israel's perspective and then from the Palestinians' perspective as well, it's part of a process that we've seen over the last few weeks from the first Security Council resolution to the Kerry speech and now this.

So again if this stands on its own, it could very well be that it doesn't mean anything. But if it becomes another U.N. Security Council resolution, whether Trump likes it or not, the fact is it's there.

HOWELL: Oren Liebermann, live for us in Jerusalem. Oren, thank you so much.

5:26 on the U.S. East Coast. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM in the U.S. and around the world. Still ahead, the a veteran police officer is laid to rest while her colleagues search for the killer who gunned her down. Stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:30:16] HOWELL: A warm welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. It is good to have you with us. I'm George Howell with the headlines we're following for you this hour.

China's Foreign Ministry is not happy about Donald Trump's suggestion that the United States One China policy could change once he is in the White House. A ministry spokesperson called the policy non-negotiable and said that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. Under one China, the U.S. has formal diplomatic relations with Beijing and not with Taiwan.

No word yet on whether the U.S. will accept an invitation to take part in the next round of Syrian peace talks. Turkey said that the U.S. would be asked to join those talks. The talks scheduled for January 23rd. That's just three days after Donald Trump takes the oath of office.

Special military police are responding to a new prison riot in northern Brazil. A government spokeswoman says at least 10 inmates have been killed there. The riot began after an altercation broke out between two rival gangs. This is Brazil's fifth deadly prison riot in two weeks.

The U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is getting some blow-back for his harsh response to Congressman John Lewis saying that Lewis is all talk and no action. Now residents of Lewis' district here in Atlanta, Georgia, are speaking out about that -- feud, I should say.

Nicole Carr from our affiliate WSB has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NICOLE CARR, WSB REPORTER: A civil rights icon and Georgia congressman, George Lewis, began trending online Saturday. Atlantans came to his defense.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has put his life on the line for all of us.

CARR: Rejecting backlash from President-elect Donald Trump.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's dedicated his entire life to community service. That's a lot more than what Donald Trump has to offer.

CARR: In a series of morning tweets, Trump shot back at Lewis who has boycotted the president-elect's inauguration, saying he's not a legitimate president. Trump in turn said Lewis was all talk and no action, garnering outrage from many of Lewis' Atlanta constituents.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What did you do during the Civil Rights Movement? I didn't see you out here.

CARR: It didn't stop there. The tweets which continued into the night said Lewis should concentrate on his crime-infested district, which is largely African-American and primarily comprised of the city of Atlanta. In 2015 the FBI ranked Atlanta 14 of the 20 major U.S. cities with the worst violent crime rate. Atlantans say context is key.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the only city that I feel comfortable raising a family in midtown which is just down the street from downtown.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I don't feel unsafe.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As far as I'm concerned about that, there's much crime in our neighborhood than there is in politics.

CARR: Trump's tweets have garnered an invitation from Fulton County chairman John Eads.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he needs to come here and see what's here, the good and what the opportunities are.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOWELL: Thanks to affiliate WSB and Nicole Carr for that report.

John Lewis is not the only one in Washington not seeing eye-to-eye with Donald Trump. His inauguration just days away. Some of Trump's Cabinet picks seemed to disagree with him on key issues.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny has this report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump is facing a new round of opposition on Capitol Hill. Not from Democrats but from his own Cabinet nominees. At one confirmation hearing after another, Trump's team is contradicting the president- elect on some of his key campaign trail promises.

On Russia, Trump taking a far softer tone on Vladimir Putin than his pick for Defense secretary, retired General James Mattis did.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: If Putin likes Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability.

GEN. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY NOMINEE: I have very modest expectations about areas of cooperation with Mr. Putin.

ZELENY: On the intelligence probe into Russian hacking, Trump sounded far less certain than Mike Pompeo, his choice to lead the CIA.

TRUMP: As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we get also hacked by other countries and other people.

REP. MIKE POMPEO (R), CIA DIRECTOR NOMINEE: It's pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy. I'm very clear eyed about what that intelligence report says.

ZELENY: At Trump Tower Friday, the president-elect downplayed the differences between his views and those of his perspective cabinet.

TRUMP: I told them to be yourselves and say what you want to say. Don't worry about me. And I'm going to do the right thing, whatever it is. I may be right. And they may be right. But I said be yourself.

ZELENY: But his rhetoric before the election, and since is now colliding with governing, sending mixed signals to Americans and allies about where the new Trump administration stands.

On the campaign trail, Trump railed against NATO, while his defense secretary nominee took a different view.

[05:35:02] TRUMP: NATO is obsolete. It was 67 years or over 60 years old.

MATTIS: Having served once as NATO a supreme allied commander is the most successful military alliance probably in modern world history, maybe ever.

ZELENY: Senators spent much of their time this week asking the nominees if they agree with Trump's views on hot-button issues, like torture. His pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said he did not.

TRUMP: Would I approve waterboarding? You bet your ass I'd approve it.

SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R), ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE: Congress is taking an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture.

ZELENY: And in one of his biggest pledges of all, building a wall on the border with Mexico --

TRUMP: We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration.

ZELENY: His pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired General John Kelly, disagreed.

GEN. JOHN KELLY, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY NOMINEE: A physical barrier it and of itself will not do the job. It has to be really a layered defense.

ZELENY (on camera): And Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson contradicted a view of Trump on climate change this week, saying he believes climate change exists and requires a global response.

Now Donald Trump has said he wants members of his Cabinet to have their own views. The question is, whose views the Cabinet or the president become the policy of this new administration?

Now to Orlando, Florida, police from across the United States came together on Saturday for the funeral of one of their own. Debra Clayton was killed while trying to arrest a murder suspect. She was promoted to lieutenant in one last honor before being laid to rest.

CNN's Nick Valencia has this report for us.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NICK VALENCIA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It has been a solemn week in Orlando, punctuated Saturday by perhaps the saddest day of them all.

CHIEF JOHN MINA, ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT: Today we are mourning but we're also here to honor a beautiful life, an extraordinary person, a wife, mother, daughter, sister, police officer, leader.

VALENCIA: Master Sergeant Debra Clayton, a 17-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, laid to rest.

MINA: We have all struggled this past week to come up with the words to soft your loss and there really aren't any. Words cannot begin to express our heartache.

VALENCIA: More than 1,000 people attended her funeral at the First Baptist Church of Orlando. Officers from all over the country came, too.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was courageous.

VALENCIA: Before the service began, two of her colleagues and friends reminded everyone just how big of a void was left behind by her death.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's sad. It's senseless death. She loved her job. She was a strong-willed woman with a contagious smile. She is going to be missed but never forgotten.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She had a passion to make Orlando better. She like myself grew up here in Orlando. For her to be taken away by someone in the community she loved, someone was from the same area as her is just hard.

VALENCIA: She was murdered by a man police say was already on the run for allegedly killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend in December. In an exchange that lasted less than 30 seconds, police say fugitive Mark Keith Lloyd took the life of Sergeant Debra Clayton. At one point they say he stood over her body and continued to fire even though she laid on the ground defenseless.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As we celebrate the life and the legacy of Master Sergeant Debra Clayton --

VALENCIA: Of the more than 700 officers in the city, Clayton was one of the most engaged in the Orlando community, an officer, yes, but also a community activist determined to bridge the gap between police and the public. Her friends and colleagues have only one message for the man suspected of killing her.

(On camera): Any message to Mark Keith Lloyd? If he could hear you guys, and you could speak directly to him.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry, I don't have something nice to say right now.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You won't get away with this. I'm confident in our department and we will turn over every stone to find you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you guys so much. We're all very sorry.

HOWELL: Welcome back. At least 10 inmates are dead in northeastern Brazil after another prison riot broke out there. Special military police forces were deployed to regain control. The prison is overcrowded but experts say the bigger problem is an ongoing conflict between rival drug gangs. Violence in Brazil's prisons began two weeks ago. More than 100 inmates have been killed in five different riots since New Year's Day.

Dozens of people are missing after a boat carrying 110 migrants sank off the Libyan coast. A French warship along with a plane and helicopter are searching for passengers. And so far, rescuers have pulled four survivors from the choppy seas. At least eight more people have been found dead. 5,000 people died last year trying to make similar journeys across the Mediterranean.

[05:45:05] It is still very cold across much of the United States and Europe. Our meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here to tell us about it.

(WEATHER REPORT)

HOWELL: Allison, thank you. We'll stay in touch with you on it.

Extreme weather is also killing Peru's alpacas. Some 2,000 have died in the south of the country after a cold front and widespread flooding hit the region. The animals starved to death on the grasslands they grazed on froze over. Many residents from the region depend on alpacas for their livelihood and they've requested assistance from the government. Local media further report the region has been hit by drought, which itself has hampered alpaca breeding.

So say it ain't so. One of the most famous circuses in the world is shutting down for good. Feld Entertainment, the parent company of the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Show says it is closing its more than 100-year-old circus extravaganza. The last show will be in May of this year.

CEO Kenneth Feld said ticket sales dropped dramatically when elephants were cut from the show. That move came after years of pressure from animal rights groups and fines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

A successful launch and return for a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Saturday. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Four, three, two, one, liftoff of Falcon 9.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOWELL: It is always so cool to see these things happen. It blasted off from a U.S. Air Force base in the state California carrying 10 communication satellites. This was the first launch for the private space company since a similar rocket exploded in September. It was followed by a smooth return landing for the rocket's first stage booster. It glided onto an ocean platform that is known as the drone ship.

SpaceX and its rivals have been trying to perfect the landing because reusing the rocket is key to making space travel more affordable.

And from outer space to your inner peace, take a look at this. This newly-discovered Buddha statue that's been sitting undisturbed in a southeastern China reservoir for hundreds of years. Archaeologists say it dates back to China's Ming Dynasty. The top of the Buddha's head appeared when the water level dropped. You can see here remnants, though, of a temple have also been discovered below the water.

A big story we're following this week, the transition of power. Come January 20th, the Obamas will be moving out of the White House, but during their eight years there, the U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama was one of America's favorites on television.

[05:55:04] MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: It is nuts. I feel like crying right now. I didn't think that --

MOOS: Her last talk show appearance featured her surprising people. As they delivered farewell messages.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To continue to go high, even when the challenges of life make us feel low. Thank you so much.

MOOS: She was even serenaded by Stevie Wonder who adjusted his lyrics.

It won't be easy to follow in her dance steps.

(On camera): Without further adieu, we present the greatest hits of the comedy stylings of Michelle Obama.

(Voice-over): Of course, there was the evolution of mom dancing alongside Jimmy Fallon in drag. Followed by the evolution of mom dancing two with classics like getting a bag from your collection of plastic bags under the sink. She did carpool karaoke.

Went shopping CVS with Ellen --

OBAMA: We need help on aisle two. This is hard.

MOOS: She was always promoting her Let's Move campaign. She's even beat Ellen who gave up after 20 push-ups. No wonder Stevie is singing in tribute.

2443098046,"The first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket launched Saturday has returned to port in Southern California after landing on a floating platform in the Pacific Ocean, ready for refurbishment and potential reuse on a future mission.

The 15-story booster and its barge, named ""Just Read the Instructions,"" were towed into the Port of Los Angeles, a few miles south of SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, before sunrise Tuesday after sailing from the touchdown point in the Pacific.

The rocket is the seventh Falcon 9 first stage recovered by SpaceX since December 2015.

Counting recovery attempts on land and at sea, SpaceX is now 7-for-12 in rocket landing tries after launches carrying satellites into orbit. It was the first time SpaceX has succeeded in retrieving a rocket intact after a launch from California.

Saturday's mission blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's Central Coast and deployed 10 next-generation communications satellites into orbit nearly 400 miles (700 kilometers) above Earth for Iridium.

It was the first SpaceX mission since a Falcon 9 exploded on a launch pad in Florida on Sept. 1, grounding the rocket for four-and-a-half months."

2443110706,"A Japanese rocket designed to be the lightest and smallest rocket to ever send a payload into orbit failed during launch on Sunday, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The 32-foot-tall rocket, SS-520, was built with the goal of reducing the costs of spaceflight and orbital launches.

JAXA is attempting to demonstrate that a small and inexpensive rocket, only $3.5 million for the SS-520, can be launched with currently available technology. The standard payment for a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch, in comparison, is $62 million, and the Falcon 9 stands 224 feet tall.

The SS-520 rocket was carrying an Earth-observation microsatellite called TRICOM-1, an experimental CubeSat built at the University of Tokyo. CubeSats, small and inexpensive satellites with specific functions, have a wide array of potential uses and are being launched more and more often. The small rocket was meant to launch TRICOM-1 ""without the usual deployer,"" with the CubeSat instead ""mounted on the launch vehicle without the usual guiding rails or tabs.""

However, after liftoff and the first stage engine burn, lasting 31 seconds, SS-520 experienced a communications failure. JAXA had to abort the rocket, which sent both it and TRICOM-1 into the Pacific ocean. Neither have yet been recovered, leaving the exact nature of the failure a mystery.

""The cause of the failure is not known at all yet. All we can do is just analyze the data we got until communications were disrupted,"" said Shinya Matsuura, a writer covering Japanese spaceflight, to Japan Times. ""I hope they won't be discouraged and will try another launch, because demand for launches of minisatellites is growing worldwide."""

2443167484,"[Via Satellite 01-17-2017] January 14 saw a successful return to flight for SpaceX after the company suffered a launch anomaly in September 2016.

During the weekend launch, the company sent 10 satellites to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for the Iridium Next constellation aboard a Falcon 9 rocket

The satellites, the first in a planned 70-cubesat constellation, were delivered into LEO approximately one hour after the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:54:39 a.m. PST.

Shortly after launching, SpaceX was able to land the launch vehicle's first stage on the company's Pacific-Ocean-located autonomous spaceport drone ship, ""Just Read the Instructions.""

For the constellation, Iridium partnered with Thales Alenia Space to manufacture, assemble and test 81 Iridium Next satellites, of which SpaceX will launch at least 70, with the aim to replace and upgrade Iridium's commercial satellite network.

SpaceX delivered the first 10 Iridium Next satellites to a 625-kilometer temporary parking orbit where Iridium will test and exercise the spacecraft over the coming weeks. The satellites will then be moved into their 780 km operational orbit and begin providing service to Iridium's customers. One-by-one, Iridium will position the new satellites near a current generation satellite; each moving at approximately 17,000 miles per hour as testing begins. Iridium will re-position the nearby inter-satellite communication to point to the new Iridium Next satellite as it prepares to takeover service. The company will eventually de-boost and de-orbit existing satellites.

Through the satellites, Iridium plans to deliver the Iridium Certus broadband multi-service capability, as well as Aireon's space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) system, which will provide oceanic and rural aircraft tracking to the aviation industry when the service becomes operational in 2018."

After nearly a century and a half of shows the parent company of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus says it will go out of business in May. Executives blame high-operating costs and declining attendance, especially following the end of the elephant acts. Manuel Bojorquez is at a circus training center in Sarasota, Florida. Manuel, good morning.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ (CBS News National Correspondent): Good morning. This is the so-called greatest little show on Earth. It`s a training ground for young aspiring performers, some of whom hoped to join Ringling Brothers. But it`s an art form with an uncertain future despite a spectacular past.

(Begin VT)

MAN #1: Two, one, go.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: With high-flying stunts and exotic animals, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, was big-time entertainment under the big top captivating audiences for nearly one hundred fifty years.

MAN #2: The premiere of the new Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: But attendance has been falling. Ringling tried to remain relevant adding ice-skating and BMX tricks. Just last week they introduced their first female ringmaster. But the circus`s parent company says last year`s decision to let go of some of their biggest performers amid pressure from animal rights groups was the final straw.

JULIETTE FELD (Feld Entertainment COO): Removing the elephants from the touring units we saw a very sharp drop in attendance, much greater than we anticipated and that`s led us to this decision because the business model was no longer sustainable.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Activists are claiming victory but are still concerned about the future of the animals.

BEN WILLIAMSON (PETA Senior International Media Director): They still have the possibility to do right by the animals by moving them to accredited sanctuaries.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: At the Circus Arts Conservatory in Sarasota, which trains young circus stars of tomorrow, many are heartbroken to see the show end.

DOLLY JACOBS: It`s a magic that you feel once you walk into the tent.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Former Ringling aerialist Dolly Jacobs says an instructor here and her dad, Lou, was one of Ringling`s most famous clowns.

Is this the end of an era?

DOLLY JACOBS: In my heart, I don`t want to believe that. It`s part of Americana, it`s part of our DNA in America. It`s, you know, it`s-- it`s a memory maker.

MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: The final Ringling Brothers show will be in Uniondale, New York, on May twenty-first. We may learn more about the future of the circus`s employees and its animals when the company addresses the media at its headquarters later this morning here in Sarasota. Gayle.

2443410828,"LOS ANGELES (AP) - The first stage of a SpaceX rocket that landed on a platform floating in the Pacific Ocean after a weekend launch has arrived in the Port of Los Angeles.

Spectators watched Tuesday as the landing barge entered the harbor with the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket standing vertically.

Justin Everhart of nearby Long Beach described it to the Daily Breeze newspaper (http://bit.ly/2jGXkqg) as ""a testament to human achievement.""

The Falcon 9 put 10 satellites into orbit Saturday after being launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles.

When the rocket's second stage took over to complete the trip into orbit, the first stage descended toward the ocean and fired its engines to land on the barge.

SpaceX intends to reuse first stages to lower launch costs."
